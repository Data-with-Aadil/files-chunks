rocket lake use sunny cove not that old washed up weak skylake.,single core is so damn slow hahaha its a shame the 10/20 joke shouldnt even exists.,no gen 4 it completely sucks.,"even 11400f has a better single core than a 10900k and supports gen 4 ðÿ˜‚ðÿ˜‚ðÿ˜‚ðÿ˜‚ and that runs only at 4,4 and the shit 10900k is at 5,3 for a single core ðÿ˜‚ðÿ˜‚ðÿ˜‚ðÿ˜‚ðÿ˜‚",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i would definitely be looking at lower priced 12th gen chips.,12700k is about 2/3 the price and will most likely hand it to the 11900k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is only if you can cool it down...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that is partially true as the majority of the chips but not all from the same lineup have the same die, and their skus are only named off the fact that they have more or less features, cores or different clocks.",the reason why i asked was because i thought the 11700k had less cores but it turns out it does not.,just clarifying.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i thought they patched that out with new microcode?,"anyway, cool if it does, i'd rather have that than e-cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i dont know what you are talking about lol.,it's not because you a loosing a few fps in 1080p in a couple of game that loves cache latency that the chip has bad price/performances lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
only 300 now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
where does your performance benchmark comes from?,"it was never sold at retail because content creators tanked the chip, they binned the chip and imc, out of the box performance doesnt mean nothing for this chip.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but rkl isn't bad lol.,"as much fun as this subreddit has stomping all over it, rkl was a great stopgap product that, if not necessarily more performant, fixed a critical skylake bug causing instability, and a generally superior platform.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well as long as the product isnâ€˜t dangerous and a legit product it is a pretty good thought.,if you would offer me that cpu for idk letâ€˜s say 100$ i would take it instantly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is this bizzarro cult-like following of gamersnexus?,"every time he makes some video opining about something, people like you keep linking it like it's some kind of debating-ending gospel.",just like the whole 'tubes on top' shit with aios.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm assuming you didn't watch the video.,the whole thesis of it is the opposite of what you're saying.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is no use case for avx512 for the average person,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the bug that resulted in ""internal parity errors"" caused crashes in apex even on lower core count skus, not all that obscure imo.","was also a problem for oc and kind of popped up everywhere, if rarely.",but apex really exposed it.,"on the 10c variant though it was pretty much everywhere, minecraft, rdr2, many aaa, especially with rtx and dlss... not good.","it's why i would never recommend the 8c+ skylake over rkl, despite the underwhelming performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
only the 12900k has problems with mediocre cooling.,the i5s and non-k i7s have to problems at all.,"for a 12600k, you could do away easily with a u12s or smth",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ofc 200$ on cooler, case and fans is a minimum.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they did on a bios-level, for the lower end boards.",but most people will be using z690 or something on par with that if they're running a 12th gen i7 or i9.,which currently still allows for avx512 if i'm correct.,"i could be wrong, but i recall the non e-core skus (i5-12500 and lower) with mid to low tier boards have had the avx512 extension disabled by intel.","still though, like i said, i *may* be wrong.",others could chime in if that's the case lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"youâ€™re right, itâ€™s not: the chip was bad value because the 5900x, a vastly better cpu, was the same price.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 12600k is considerably faster and more efficient in every single workload, so unfortunately iâ€™m gonna have to say thatâ€™s not good enough.",itâ€™s worth at most $250 now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
except there is no way intel would've sold it for $100.,"the 

\> no bad chips, only bad prices.",platitude oversimplifies the issue.,the reality is far more nuanced.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rpcs3 begs to differ.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
talking about the 11900k compared to the 11700k.,"i hd both chips, i actually run the same oc due to thermals only",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think intel intended consumers to buy it with the coolermaster cryo cooler..... but they say under load is like a nomal aio... i had a 11700k, tought i could reach better imc clock in gear 1 with the binned 11900k... nope.",its stable at higher clock but thermalthrottle happend quite fast with the voltage needed... it eats up 375w its insane,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">on e-core skus (i5-12500 and lower) with mid to low tier boards have had the avx512 extension

yeah i saw that somewhere too and was disappointed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
another ignorant comment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well yeah obviously intel would not do it but that doesnâ€˜t change the fact that for 100 usd it would actually be a good product-> no bad product just the price was bad.,idk why intel not selling at 100$ would make that statement false because it all hypothetical anyway.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
uhâ€¦ whatâ€™s your defense of the 11900k then?,"thereâ€™s nothing it did that a chip of equal or lesser price couldnâ€™t do better, apart from maybe a few niche single-threaded workloads.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what cpu do you have?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5ghz is the stock single-core boost frequency on the 12700k.,"the all-core boost frequency can depend on many things such as your power limits, thermal headroom, whether you have thermal velocity boost enable and a myriad of other things.",but typically you would expect to see 4.7ghz on the p-cores and 3.6ghz on the e-core under load at stock.,maybe do some research into the product you're buying before angrily throwing around accusations of not getting what you paid for.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my 12700k goes up to 4.84ghz max.,i haven't overclocked it yet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel core i7-12700k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you iâ€™m not mad though i didnâ€™t mean to sound rude but thanks for the help,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you tuned the bios?,did you set to performance power plan in windows?,you need to.do this to achieve 5ghz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no i donâ€™t need to achieve 5 ghz but i paid for that frequency and the software said the max frequency was below 5 ghz so i wonder if itâ€™s throttled i just got the cpu i want to make sure itâ€™s not damaged,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the bios is all tuned up all the p cores are at 5 ghz and all the records are at 3.8 ghz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what temps are we talking about?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i saw my cpu rise at 90â°c on my nzxt lcd display,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what software?,prime95?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what software the hwmonitor?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no i was running minecraft surprisingly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it wouldnâ€™t be a huge hit to performance but it will still affect your performance a bit.,iâ€™d go for a pcie 4.0 cable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i've found that running a pcie riser cable, even a good one rated for gen 4 speeds, drops a slight bit of performance (like maybe 1-2%).",running a gen 4 gpu as gen 3 limits performance a little more (on top of the slight speed loss of the riser cable).,[techspot did a deep dive here](https://www.techspot.com/review/2104-pcie4-vs-pcie3-gpu-performance/) .,"some titles are affected more than others by pcie speed, but the difference isn't massive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
be careful as riser cable quality greater differs.,some are absolutely terrible and will cause problems.,i'm on mobile now but i think the sfpc sub has a list somewhere of which brands to buy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the biggest issue is definitely the one op already discovered - at motherboard defaults (such as a fresh bios update or clear cmos), it will fail to boot until it's manually limited to gen3 again, which usually requires unplugging the riser and slotting the gpu directly into the motherboard.","for a full size desktop, it's perhaps an occasional minor convenience, but for an sff enclosure (seeing they're running an matx board) it might mean pulling the whole motherboard out to get access.",pain in the butt.,i'd strongly suggest getting a gen4 capable riser.,"might as well do it right, especially with a shiny new build.",:p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i totally agree here, got really bad luck with brand fractal design vrc-25 riser cable.",setup went smooth and everything settled in place in 15 minutes but after that i kept getting whea-logger errors in my windows event log.,i gotta say fractal design looks pretty solid and firmly made but something is still wrong with it.,"days of research didn't help me out, kept getting whea-logger errors corresponding pci-e device errors so i had to remove it and put card back to mobo slot directly",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i am aware of this and wish to disable it on the bios level,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"email msi and ask them for a version of the latest bios with a hpet option, it's left hidden by default for most consumer boards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

are you sure something in your system isnâ€™t the issue other than e-cores?,intel already released an official statement saying that the problems with e-cores in specific games was fixed.,i can speak from experience that my 12700f and 3080 12gb has never crashed in wh2.,i play it about 2-3 hours a day.,i highly suggest investigating something else before disabling your e-cores; thatâ€™s a huge performance dump.,you should also be running windows 11. adl was made in conjunction with it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"try using processhacker to set then save affinity https://i.imgur.com/809nmdp.png

https://processhacker.sourceforge.io/nightly.php

this will allow you to put your background tasks on the e cores and your game on the p cores.",this should also result in better performance than disabling e cores if you have multiple apps running due to less contention for the same resources.,"it should prevent the crashing you're seeing as well, in theory.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not the best advice but, dig around in bios more for *the* setting that does it.","failing that, swap it out for a 12400.","(not ideal, but solves the problem.....)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it took hours of googling to figure all that out haha.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
im trying that program now but i dont know what core # are the e cores.,is there a way to find out?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah it seems windows 11 upgrade should solve your issue.,thatâ€™s what iâ€™m running.,"intel said the issues with e-core compatibility was solved like a month ago, so i doubt itâ€™s that.",good luck and 1 more week till wh3!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'd guess they'd be the last 4. 

maybe use a tool like hwinfo64 to check the clock rates for the cores.","it's my understanding the e cores don't clock up as high, so figure out which 4 don't clock up to the same speeds the other 8 do.",https://i.imgur.com/wxuglgr.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"welp it worked, after 7 crashes b4 i was able to click through all the cores fast enough it stayed on and i was able to load into a game with out it crashing.","but it tanked the performance so hard it was 1 frame per 2 seconds unfortunately, but at least it did confirm it is the e cores that are the problem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"huh, i was pretty confident that would allow it to play.",i feel like the low in-game fps could be something else but idk much about the whole situation.,let me know if you resolve this.,i was looking into purchasing an alder lake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you get the low fps when you run with e cores disabled in the bios?,are there any additional processes launched by the game?,"such as the launcher, punkbuster, or easyanticheat?","in the ""services"" tab of processhacker, search for them, as well as ""pnkbstra"", ""pnkbstra"", etc.",make sure they're running on the p cores.,some other processes that possibly need to be moved to the p cores that you may have not thought about is the display driver.,"for instance, with nvidia, the processes mentioned in this article https://www.howtogeek.com/343120/what-are-all-those-nvidia-processes-running-in-the-background/.",also move or disable any software that draws over the game.,"this includes overlays such as gamebar, the steamoverlay process and msi afterburners rtss (rivatuner statistics server).","if it's still lagging, try a fresh reboot and immediately launch process hacker.",with it running in the background it notifies you of any newly registered services.,launch the game and see if any additional services get launched.,"also in the ""processes"" tab, sort by start time and observe all the processes that started up at the same time your game launched
 & move them to the p cores.","if this isn't enough, uninstall the game with processhacker running to get notifications of unregistered services, then reinstall it and observe the notifications for newly registered services",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel could tie the l3 caches to core speed, with xe's larger l2 cache being more suited for feeding the gpu at low power.","~~there's also on chip dsps with llcs that amount to several megabytes, i never understood why they didn't just pool that into a large slc cache.~~  
core series cpus have them on the pch, it's only atoms that have them integrated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this was definitely a fun article to see.,"i do like the technical comparison to apple m1 max's cache structure -- as it talks about the much different design goals for m1 (max) vs alder lake in general.. 

it almost sounds like they should consider having two different cache heirarchys in the future - 1 focused on pure power consumption reduction, and another for more performance oriented targets.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why do that?,"all-core turbo should be 4.8ghz and single-core turbo should be 5.1-5.2ghz, then there's the issue of relatively high voltage for the, not only will it be performing worse than stock but also power consumption likely isn't lower than stock, or at least not much lower.","if you don't plan on overclocking it to at least 5ghz or just can't (for example, if your cooler can't handle it) then you're better off just leaving it at stock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"4.5ghz isn't an overclock, it's an underclock.",the 11900k will default all core turbo to 4.8ghz and with abt it will do 5.1ghz.,what's the purpose for locking it at 4.5?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yep seems fine, i have seen worse",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maximum: 1.337 volts.,of course it's safe!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dude i didnâ€™t post to have a debate about clock speeds.,"the base clock is 3.5, so technically 4.5 is an overclock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was just pointing out that it's 1337 but generally 1.35v is a regular overclocked voltage and 1.45v is where you're unsafe.,you're below 1.35v so you're totally fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good to know!,thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is there a reason you need z690 besides overclocking?,because your spending more on the board than the cpu with what youve chosen.,"for pure performance you could get a 12700f and b660 and come out cheaper or similar cost with better performance, and not have any overclocking reliability concerns.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
b660 + 12700f and then any saved money on a gen4 ssd.,k series are usually just extra heat and energy for minimal gains.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

u use a b or h series board with a non k chip.,and z series with a k sku,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
f series doesn't allow overclocking and doesn't include an igpu.,"imo, overclocking doesn't do much other than increase heat and power.",if a cpu was going to bottleneck a gpu the overclocking wouldn't usually help.,12700f is an i7 and comes with an extra 2 p cores.,"i would recommend it if it was a similar price to the 12600k, and that way you definitely don't need to pay extra for the motherboard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the 2060 super would be the bottleneck in 1440p and 4k gaming.,i would just prefer it over the 12600k at the same price.,if you are worried about the 2060 super being the bottleneck and you want to save money you can buy a 12400f.,12400f + 2060 super would be a good combo.,i would personally prefer 12400f + 6700xt rather than 12600k + 2060 super if they were the same price.,"[https://pcpartpicker.com/list/bgdwzw](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/tdb6hk)

it is early days for e cores, i see a huge future for them.","lumping 12400 overclocked vs a 12900k in gaming on a blank system is not something i would consider to be incredibly valuable information...some 12400 users may overclock, yes.","depending on the game, i am sure it will do great, 6 cores is probably good for desktop pcs in a vacuum.",i am pretty sure performance will degrade significantly over a 12900k when multi tasked applications and reduced boost durations are taken into account...ie long term gaming sessions (not minute long benchmarks with recovery times) along side background apps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what's your goal?,perhaps lower the p core multiplier by about 4 to cap out those maximum power spikes.,it auto manages its own voltages.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"p-cores turbo to 1.2-1.3v, pulling e-cores to that voltage as well so you might as well clock the e-cores as high as possible.","to hit the e-core voltage minimum at stock (~0.9-1.0v), you'd have to downclock the p-cores down to like 3.6ghz

you might as well just focus on the p-cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
could have big implications for battery life tbh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh, so i could reduce the multiplier differently for p cores and e cores, but the voltage will reduce by the same amount to follow p cores, right?","so let's say i reduced max p cores clock speed by 20% and max e cores clock speed by 30%, does it mean that e cores could be running faster with the same consumption because the voltage is following p cores?","related to this, i'm aware that:
w = v * a

in this context, are amps fixed or they depend on something else?",(like clock speed),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah.,"i assume voltage would go down automatically, doing this.","power consumption is linear w frequency, but scales with square of the voltage.",lower voltage helps a lot with power consumption.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">so let's say i reduced max p cores clock speed by 20% and max e cores clock speed by 30%, does it mean that e cores could be running faster with the same consumption because the voltage is following p cores?",it means e-cores will be slower by 30% if you decrease its clocks by 30%.,voltage doesn't change frequency.,">related to this, i'm aware that: w = v * a

if you want to push this higher, increase the cpu l2 voltage.",41-44 should be possible at 1.35v.,"> llc1, bios vcore 1.305, xmp

>what's more crazy is the 12700k hits 90â° in cinebench r23 pulling 182w.,the r7 5800x is hot boyyy and would throttle using same cooler in cinebench due to its 90â°c thermal limit.,"i also have data using 240mm aio for 5800x, but still waiting on lga1700 mounting kits for 12700k.",frankly intel should've adopted throttling back boost at 70c+ like ryzen after tech press didn't say it was throttling.,right now intel cpus boost voltage to hold turbo clocks at higher temperatures which makes its highest turbo states extremely inefficient in all-core load.,intel is also slow at responding to ryzen's battery strategy in mobile after tech press turned a blind eye.,no architectural advantage will overcome the competitor not turboing during battery benchmarks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what was the power consumption of ryzen 7 5800x?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's great to finally see a good test with the c14s and alder lake.,i've designed a custom sff case around the c14s and am strongly leaning towards purchasing the 12700k for it.,but i wonder by how much temps can be lowered with the c14s by undervolting and/or power limiting as i've seen several articles that showed power draw can be significantly lowered - with no mention of temperatures let alone temps with the c14s.,have you tried undervolting and/or power limiting the 12700k?,if you have i'd love to know what temps you got when paired with the c14s.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"stepping 0 for cpu, purchased couple weeks ago.",all info as reported by hwinfo.,i find it unlikely the 5800x is drawing 150w in cpu-z.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what makes this comment look retarded is that the ryzen cpu is consuming less power.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

don't own the 5900x.,i paid â£313 for 5800x and â£350 for 12700k.,didn't like how hot the 5800x runs.,5900x is â£450.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"likely also the improvements intel has made with the heat transfer from the silicon to the ihs, coffee lake refresh was already much cooler than ryzen at similar power consumption",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"could be motherboard, could be running at lower voltage than yours.",i'm using b660i aorus pro ddr4.,cinebench pulls 183w with c14s and 175w with 240mm aio.,i've not tried prime95.,you can see cinebench r23 data in this video using c14s: https://youtu.be/9seo95yxdum,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
op has literally put power draw chart in their post.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this is correct, zen 3 power consumption is lower, but not way lower across some cpus like 12600k and 5600x and 12700k and 5800x.",of course the 5950x trashes the 12900k by about 50% power consumption.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very valid choice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
curious about your other specs for your editing rig.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"why does the temp matter if itâ€™s within safe operating level, 5000 series run hot, they are designed to do that.",obviously there are many pros and cons for both but when they draw the same amount of power and the 5800x is much hotter itâ€™s because it is designed to do so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the stock pbo curve is pretty terrible for the 5800x.,"you can easily undervolt it, make it cooler and get better boost clocks.","however even with the stock pbo, i only ever hit over 80c in benchmarks.",normal gaming i would sit around 70c before i started lowering my pbo curve.,"yeah it shouldn't be that way stock, but what can you do.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my 5800x gets pegged at 90â°c for any all-core stress test.,"itâ€™s the hottest zen 3 sku, not least because all the heat is concentrated in a single ccd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
possibly a poor sample tbh.,"got a 5800x in the office build, and in the same cpu-z stress test it runs at 4.85ghz for the first 5 minutes, before eventually settling to a steady 4.8ghz for the rest of the 30 minutes.",maximum temp is 76â° (31â° ambient) and that's at the same 1.319v.,"using a noctua nh-d15 though, so a bit more cooling power (fans locked at 500rpm however/not set to ramp up until 85â°).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it should be a matter of heat density.,5800x got pushed too far as a single ccd product.,amd should've kept all 1ccd parts under 65w tdp and leave the thermal headroom for user tuning like pbo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why is your 12700k only drawing 130 watts?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a lot of people talk about their cpu/gpu temperature without talking about their ambient temperature.,"example, xxx cpu idles at 50â„ƒ, is it hot?",well it depends.,it's not hot if the ambient is 50â„ƒ.,temperature discussion is moot without knowing the ambient.,thumbs up to you and everyone else who talk about their ambient room temperature.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
heat transfer is the bottleneck.,energy density is really the killer metric here.,"you can simplify to w/ mm^2 of active silicon in most cases, though intel has taken steps to improve heat transfer with thinner heatapreaders and solder.","the 12700k has something like 65 mm^2 of highly active silicon (cores + l2), the 5800x comes in roughly around 40 mm^2 using cores + l2.","that's why the 5800x runs so hot, while the 12700k stays comparatively cool.","this doesn't matter if you saturate the heatpipes, but that's very unlikely to happen at sub-300w loads.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
keep in mind that sensors in cpus are not equal.,positioning and calibration can/will be different leading to different results.,for example i swapped from a 65w cpu to another 65w cpu and the software reads out like 15-20c higher temps.,like really high temps.,while the cooler is actually not hot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there's more than one image,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can read through that blog post if you're curious (there's [part 2](https://hattedsquirrel.net/2020/12/power-consumption-of-ryzen-5000-series-cpus-part-2/) dedicated to the software measurements).,"there is no official software that reports that, but you can use the [reverse-engineered tool](https://github.com/hattedsquirrel/ryzen_monitor) (it's for linux though).",these measurements are the only ones that seem to match my real-world experience.,"all these techtubers' results remain a fairytale, especially when the dram control is stressed.",(eg.,dual-rank sticks),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as someone who's had several intel 14nm cpus as well as a 12900k, 11th gen actually ran the coolest of all.","an 11900k is likely to reach instability around 85c or so at 5.2+ ghz, it's actually fascinating how much power it can consume without overheating on an aio.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah, but another reviews and charts show different results.",i do not have a problem with new intel cpus and i am not an amd fanboy either.,my main problem with these comparisons that older products are compared to new ones.,"i think new ryzens will be the real rivals of alder lake, and their comparison will be more relevant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i was rocking 5600x & 2070 super fe for most part, them swapped to 3060 ti, mangaged to get 5800x at good deal.","it was too hot, so changed to 12700k once a mini-itx ddr4 motherboard was released that i liked.",i sell my parts when i upgrade for most part.,"so that would be 12700k & 3060 ti, 16gb 3600 c16 ram.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this is just a comparison ðÿ˜, but to me personally it matters as i use sffpc cases which have limited cpu cooler compatibility.","plus lower temps means better cpu boosting, lower system temps",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is there a good video guide or anything on tweaking a 5800x?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to be fair, intel cpus can also be overly generous with voltage out of the box.",you can drop load line calibration as well to lower operating voltage and temps.,the is a stock for stock compared set of charts.,start tweaking the ryzen system and you will need to tweak the intel system too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
either you got a golden sample or exaggerate like crazy...31ambient and only 500rpm?,no way you are topping out at 76c when literally every review for the chip shows it much hotter with lower ambients and higher fan speeds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"your using 360 aio and lm, and you calling my sample poor when comparing to yours lol ðÿ˜†.",hardly a fair comparison: 360 aio with lm vs noctua c14s ðÿ¤£ of course your temps will be much better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's running cpu-z stress test,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this makes a lot of sense, thanks.","and then since the 5900x has an additional die to spread the about the same amount of power around, it makes sense that the cpu runs cooler.",it's funny to me that to understand this you have to see what's under the ihs; we can't assume the ihs is doing a perfect job.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if the cooler is not hot but temperature readouts are higher, first thing that would come to mind is poor heat transfer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how could temperature be so different when power draw was same.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, fixed at 80%",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>intel reports an average of all cores.,that's fully untrue.,cpu package temperature on 12th gen is always in line with the hottest core.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think this is fair as well.,when we can nitpick over sub 5% differences in many tasks it's a good thing.,intel was forced to finally get their shit together and its been good for all of us.,"as long as amd keeps their ipc gains similar again, it will be another good year for competition.","this is exactly what all of us should have wanted, whether amd or intel fans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well , its like comparing gen 1 from company a to gen 2 from company b",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this is true, intel and amd report temperatures very differently.",intel has a far more even averaging whereas amd selects the hottest sensors.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

mine was tested using open test bench and different motherboard which is why i suspect slightly different results.,"honestly, i'd recommend switching to 240 aio but best experience.",plus you can play around with overclocking since your on z690 which if nothing else for bit of fun.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"no, as per my original comment, i'm using a nh-d15 with the 5800x in an sff case for the office build.","it's the 5900xs in the main rigs that have 360mm aios (well, one of them actually has 2x480mm rads now.","but, it's the shitter sample, so still runs 6-8â° hotter than the 360mm aio annoyingly).",i'm running at 350-400mhz higher clock than you are at the same voltage and power draw.,"so yes, i would say we have quite different samples.","not saying your results are wrong, i'm just sharing my own which happen to be quite different to yours.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have this cooler for a long time now.,used to have a 125w cpu and when the sensor readout was like 68c the cooler was quite warm/hot to touch.,then switched to a 65w cpu and it was all good.,temps much lower obviously.,now switched to a different 65w cpu and the readout is much higher but cooler is not warm.,i do not think it is the thermal paste.,has always been applied the same.,so either unter the heatspreader of that cpu is something wrong or the sensor readout is just plain wrong.,it never throttled and always reaches its advertised boost clock.,so not sure what is going on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"thanks, and yeah",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes but it doesn't matter 31 is relatively high ambient and 500 rpm basically moves no air compared to even 1000+ so..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i wasn't 100% sure about the previous ones, that's what i said alder lake.","had a sandy bridge and a coffee lake before this, but never really cared about monitoring temps, they were like ""install, overclock a bit, temps fine?, leave it like that for years"".","damn al has made me obsesive with monitoring temps haha, at least the first three months owning it, i hope the obsession dies down.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, mine is f5 defaults with xmp on.",couldn't find any bios level specifics.,nor the actual mb used for this testing.,your source more than likely has really bad mounts with their alder lake chips.,"i am on a xe 360 in push pull, but there's no way that and a fan profile is accounting for a 25c delta",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"indeed, albeit if you've ever played around with a fan curve in any great detail, it's quite normal for there to be a point of diminishing returns relatively early on in the rpm band.","even my main rig - which is primarily for benchmarking, and has multiple 480mm rads and 20 noctua industrial 3000rpms - doesn't really see much gain after 1000rpm.","when i crank them to 3000rpm for my benches, it works great.",but most of the rpm range in between is pretty pointless when you look at the returns it gives on temps vs the increase in power draw and dba.,"this is an extreme case, and you can definitely see some more nuanced results in cases which have worse airflow than mine (main builds are in thermaltake core p8s, so nearly a test bench setup, and the office build is in a thermaltake tower 100).","i used to use the nzxt h series of cases (h200/700), and jesus, they needed every little bit of help they could get with their airflow by comparison.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i don't know why you are explaining fan curves and rpm here...everything has a point of diminishing return yes i know but 500 rpm isn't even close and not nearly enough to cool a cpu under load unless it is a very weak low power one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"cool, thanks.",the screen grap is not very good as can't make out anything,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for some reason i thought it was the same or similar model cpus and you were testing things out.,"if it's crossgenerational differences, then maybe readouts, sensors and what not could have been the factor too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this shouldnâ€™t come as a surprise to anyone.,"the 5800x has all eight cores in a single 80mm ccx, the intel cores are spread out over a larger area.",makes sense at the same power draw that intel would run cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i dont even want to look at 3070 price though its msrp is abput 450$ here

  
gpu is a lost cause..  i upgraded in late 2020 from 7600k to 10400f for that sweet 6 cores.","by the time i can afford a gpu like 3070, my cpu will be old again.",i will suck it up to it.,its not worth it .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also rx 6600 non xt is a good card and much faster than 3050.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is only one retailer here who actually sold 3060ti at launch for msrp.,he is the official nvidia partner.,he no more sells it now.,3060ti is ridiculously priced in india.,"three times costlier than 3050.

thanks for your reply.. i looked at lot of reviews about 3050.. but all of them talk about 1080p only.","i will look at 6600xt , its not ridiculously priced like 3060ti.",can 6600xt do some rt stuff..!,?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ya thank you.. at present i cant afford other than 3050.. i thought about ram.. but the board i hv and 10400f dsnt support more than 3000mhz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was about to ask this about non xt one but u answered it already.,thank you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you have a h470 or lower motherboard then don't bother with upgrading your ram because you'll still be limited at 2666mhz anyways, unless you replace the motherboard with a z490 or at least a b560 board you won't be able to take advantage of faster ram speeds, 3000mhz or more accurately 2933mhz, if i'm not wrong, is for 10th gen i7s and i9s.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if op does have a upper tier mobo then he should be able to run 3000mhz with xmp and that will help with frame time consistency.,however intel cpus arenâ€™t inherently crippled by memory bandwidth as bad as earlier gen ryzen.,"i remember using 2666mhz with my r5 2600 and changing it out for a 3200mhz kit and while average fps wasnâ€™t drastically changed, the 1% & 0.1% lows went up a lot and made everything feel a lot smoother overall.",both ram kits were cl16 (which was kinda bad for the 2666mhz set) but iâ€™m sure op could get some with lower timings if they canâ€™t use xmp.,that way they get the most out of the capped memory speed for the cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks for explaining, but i checked the specs of my mobo h410 pro which caps ram speed at 2666mhz for i5 processors",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks a ton, i checked my mobo specs again.. it says it support pci gen 3 only.. would this be bottleneck if i go with 3050 or 6600 gpu ?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ffffffff mobo spec sheet says 3000mhz is not supported by i5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i checked some videos it shows lot of fps gain from 2100 mhz to 2666mhz, while 2666mhz to 3200mhz gets fps gain about 8.

my concern is gpu now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

afaik there is no reason they wouldn't.,"plus i imagine it's needed for deep link, which arc will support.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
off course they will support quicksync,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they already released info where with a intel cpu with igp and intel gpu, the gpu will use the igp resources.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wait a second... so i need an intel cpu to have access to quick sync even if i get a dedicated intel gpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,there is no chance they would artificially limit the media engines in a dgpu.,the point was that the intel dgpus can work in tandem with intel igpus via what intel are calling 'deep link'.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think that's a cool feature but it really doesn't affect me since all i want is the quick sync feature but i don't want to change my cpu and motherboard to get it installing a dedicated gpu would be an ideal solution for my network attached storage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"out of curiosity, why do you want a media accelerator in a nas?",are you using it for a plex server?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes,  but there are also a lot of other reasons to use it... one of them using quick sync with ai to identify objects on a security camera",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very cool.,i was thinking about setting up a plex server and i think i'll try out the new arc cards for transcoding.,not sure if it'll fit in my server chassis though...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
processors don't have drivers.,for other things like the gpu or chipset you can get them from the intel website or from dell.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you need to install dell command update (google it) open that up and there is a advanced driver reinstallation option in the lower left-hand corner, or it may be tucked away in the settings panel now, either way that will put only the needed drivers back onto your pc, essentially reversing any advertent driver you may have installed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as someone else mentioned, there are no cpu drivers anymore (since like 2006).","also, that cpu is supposed to run up to 4.10 ghz.",the 3ghz is just the base clock and the turbo boost is 4.10ghz.,"if anything dell gave you performance back lol

*hot piece of garbage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great is relative to the competition at the time and what was around before.,"northwood came at a time when amd just wasn't executing on its roadmap, and intel's architecture needed really high frequencies high memory bandwidth to perform well.","northwood was probably the peak for intel's netburst architecture, when they released the 875p chipset with dual channel ddr400.","amd would counter with athlon 64 5 months later, and intel would be struggling to keep up until they released core 2 in 2006.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah it has been so long ago i just vaguely remember them talking about the next architecture etc.,i just thought it was neat to find these stashed away somewhere after all these years,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this was a very long time ago so i could be wrong, but you could argue that amd was executing quite well on their roadmap by then northwood came out.","athlon xp was still pretty competitive to intel's newer offerings (even with the boosted fsb, etc), and that lead continued to athlon 64, and effectively ended in 2006 with core 2.

well.. at that price it can be bit hard to find a good ram kit which is also well overclockable.,good oc ram you would prefer samsung b die kit which has timings 16-16-16-36 but then that probably cost closer to 250-300. i believe that crucial kit has 16-18-18-38 timings which isn't too bad but depends how far you are planning to oc it...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

turbo boost is enabled by default and it's only disabled if you turn it off in bios or set your maximum processor state to 99% in power options.,you can use throttlestop to undervolt and msi afterburner to undervolt gpu which lower temps and improve your performance but cpu might be locked.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

did you try to reinstall the driver?,if it simply can't see the network then it looks like the driver is not present/functional because after fresh install this is what happens because for some reason it needs a driver to be installed first unlike on realteks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it is hard to understand what you are saying.,"is the ethernet port and antenna on your motherboard, or they have separate pci cards?",killer is usually on mobo.,also - remove the cancer that is the killer app.,"in windows wireless adapters have a higher default priority, so even if there is a lan connection it will use available wifi.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

as in brought the pc pre-built cause was cheaper.,dell g-5000 from memory.,and wanted to see if the pre-installed killer control is worth it or not so wanted to test it.,i have no glue on how to get this working and the support for this is utter trash to get help from.,all i know the adapter is already installed as seen in pic.,says ethernet.,but i'm connected by wireless can i change the killer adapter to wireless?,or is it ethernet only?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's installed because the wired nic is made by ""killer"" and the wireless nic is made by quadlcomm.",at the end of the day its a marketing garbage app that you can uninstall.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

theyâ€™re going to use risc-v parts on soc cpus as onboard high core accelerators instead of software based accelerators (windows 11) like the â€œneural engineâ€ found on apples soc cpus.,and theyâ€™ll start on the commercial (server) side before consumers have intel/risc-v cpus in their laptops/desktops.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

risc-v is a fully open risc isa.,"plenty of content is freely available online, if you'd like to learn more.",risc-v international is the non-profit standards body for the isa.,intel getting involved here seems to indicate to me that they seem arm as a real threat and are looking to do something about it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i donâ€™t.,2009-2017 taught me exactly what intel will do when they are â€œon topâ€ and iâ€™d rather not live through that again.,"also, the arm â€œcatâ€ is already out of the bag thanks to appleâ€™s silicon engineers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the irony is that it has been chinese yuan that have helped keep the lights on at intel for a while...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't be late or you'll be swimming in the skylake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel is one of the few companies with the top level arm license.,risc-v is mainly for deeply embedded applications and academic research.,"you aren't going to see any commercial high performance risc-v design anytime soon, specially from intel.","this is mostly for the academic/research branch of intel, as they do collaborate with academic institutions and risc-v has gained popularity as an open platform for publication.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
more like they see theyâ€™re losing out on only providing desktop/laptop + server side cpuâ€™s and want to expand their market share.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
risc-v is for everything from microcontrollers to supercomputers.,"it's not \*deployed\* into supercomputers yet (unlike arm, for a whole 1.5 years now), but risc-v is currently being \*designed\* into supercomputers.",don't let where the puck is distract you from where the puck is going.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
risc-v is hotter than that.,"it takes time to get those high performance asics out, especially on a new isa.","there is a whole bunch of research going on in the fpga space right now, and a few asics are starting to trickle out.","hundreds of companies are developing different cores and implementations since around 2020. before then, sure, it was pretty academic.",give it 4 or 5 years and arm will have a competitor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm not sure why you mention this.,arm doesn't compete in the high performance compute space either.,risc-v is interesting for low power/small formfactor computation such as microservice applications.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fair.,"just to clarify, risc-v doesn't compete with server or consumer level devices.","not yet at least, but it is starting to look promising in the microserver (?",is that the right term?),space where cloud providers are stacking pci-e cards with small arms,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
who in the supercomputer space is planning on deploying a risc-v system?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
arm is also for everything from $1 microcontrollers to supercomputers.,cortex m0 is extremely popular in the microcontroller space.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for risc-v to catch up at that level, would imply the top players in the arm field remain stationary.",and you're dealing with companies that range from the trillion to the tens of billions of dollars in size.,so fat chance.,i don't think risc-v has any value proposition for the spaces traditionally occupied by x86 and arm.,it has a great opportunity in the niches where either are not practical.,cpu wars are exciting.,"but once a market its comoditized, to the point of how consumer, mobile, and datacenter socs are.",you have to deal with dynamics that have more to do with financial than technical issues.,"also in the tiers occupied by x86 and arm, microarchitecture, and not isa, really is the key differentiator.",after the decode stage most modern architectures look fairly the same.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"arm is absolutely competing now in the high performance in both consumer (apple m, qualcomm/nuvia) and datacenter (amazon et al).",my point was that intel's interest in risc-v is not from a perspective it being an arm/x86 competitor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh no i agree i meant theyâ€™re trying to expand beyond that and capture more of the market (cpus for cell phones and tablets and such).,as intel cpus exist only in desktops/laptops + server applications.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not today, but you have to skate to where the puck is going to.",risc-v socs you can buy on a sbc today are about 5-6 years behind arm.,in announced but not yet in production cores (but finished and available to lead customers in rtl form to evaluate in rtl simulators or fpgas) risc-v is about 3 years behind.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
europe.,the barcelona supercomputing center has been interested in risc-v for a long time.,"they are major contributors to compiler development, and also to the risc-v vector extension working group.",european processor initiative is using both arm and risc-v in different roles.,"initially it was, if i recall correctly, planning to use arm as application processor and risc-v in accelerators, but the most recent news has risc-v playing a more significant part than previously planned.",https://www.european-processor-initiative.eu/successful-conclusion-of-european-processor-initiative-phase-one/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
right.,"and risc-v already covers close to the same ground, and will soon cover all of it.","at the low end, cores such as the sifive e20, pulp zero-riscy, andes n22 are comparable to cortex m0+ while offering higher performance using less silicon area and lower energy consumption.","at the high end, you can as a consumer currently buy risc-v socs and boards with cpus similar to arm cortex a72 or a73.","as someone building a new chip, you can currently license a risc-v core similar to arm cortex a76.",all that isn't covered at the moment from arm's own core range are the very newest such as a78 and neoverse n1 and n2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hpc has a very specific definition in the industry.,"everything you said is correct, but arm is not hpc.","in cloud, arm is used for microservices and the like right now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i know what hpc means.,the #1 system in the top500 is arm based.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
risc-v is not gaining momentum as much as it is filling in the niche left by things like mips and powerpc which are going the way of the dodo in the embedded/synthesizable core world.,you're not likely to see any high performance risc-v core any time soon.,"right now you have 3 options for royalty free isa's: sparc (which is dead), power (which i don't think ibm allows you to extend, but i could be wrong), and risc-v (which is actively developed and has a permissive license).",however getting a high performance microarchitecture out of the door costs several hundred to almost 1 billion $$$.,"at that level, the cost of the isa is not a limiting factor.","and no organization is going to be $1billion on risc-v.

"if you want to dismiss what was as recently as four years ago the 13th most powerful supercomputer in the world (and their aim for the new machine is to jump well back up the list again) as mere ""academic research"" then i guess i can't stop you, but we're certainly not speaking the same language.","they are focused on production supercomputer capacity for scientific research, not on isa research.",[https://www.bsc.es/news/bsc-news/marenostrum-4-begins-operation](https://www.bsc.es/news/bsc-news/marenostrum-4-begins-operation),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you sure?,hpc is typically much smaller deployments that what i'd expect on a top500 list.,"hpc refers to high memory, high core count systems.",not necessarily clusters.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there is not much of a performance increase in gaming with an upgrade from i7 1200k to i9 12900k.",in some other applications like rendering or other multicore applications the i9 12900k benefits from its 8 e-cores (instead of 4 e-cores of the i7 12700k).,"if you use applications which benefit from more than twelve cores and you use your workstation professionally (time is money), an upgrade could be worth it.","if you focus on gaming and you don't mind a little more operating time in multicore applications, stay with the i7 12700k.","br, nexocgaming",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the 12100 gives you 12th gen improvements because it's like, faster.","same thing with the 12400. the 12300 is dumb, and the 12600, but the 12500 is good in that the igp is a bit faster, the cpu is 5% faster, the price is like $10 more.","the 12600k gives you 'improvements', compared to the 12400, or the 12600kf vs 12400f, but the problem is the non-k 12700 is $50 more, so if it's worth $90 over the 12500 for another 300-400 mhz, and 4 more little cores, then why would you not spend $50 for the 12700.

the 12900k is fine if you want the fast desktop cpu just because you can, but the 12900 is like $100 cheaper, and if you're doing something strictly multithreaded then while the 12700 is a complete no-brainer over the 12600k for only $50 more, $150 extra for the 12900 can definitely make sense for people who want 16 cores for their work and are not going to touch the overclocking settings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

bottom 3 fans = intake, pulling cold air into the case.","rear fan, cpu aio and gpu aio = exhaust, expelling all of that hot air out of the case.","i prefer this method personally, but as i said, i've tried it every which way and it doesn't really make a difference which i thought odd and annoying but yeah, hope this helps mate.",here is my current set-up as of today and my current fan set-up.,https://i.imgur.com/mmjefke.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

depends on the case and airflow.,"tiny cases are usually a challenge, but with some deliberate planning, a decent cpu cooler, and experimentation with fans, they can provide reasonable thermals, especially if you're willing to undervolt a bit at the expense of performance.","with decent ventilation, 35c is a typical idle temperature.","in a case with with a tiny cooler but okay ventilation, around 40-45c.","a 45-50c idle means you'll have to re-think the cpu cooler itself, as well as airflow in that chassis.","that's pretty warm, and so that system probably throttles under any kind of load.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"perfectly fine, my itx pc usually throttles if you are like me and use 2 screws on cpu cooler not 4. but it has not died and been like that for 3 years so it should be fine.",cpu tdp is 95w (2600x),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
idle is a useless metric.,someone runs clean os and other have tens or hundreds of background tasks.,"check load temps, they are what matters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on your ventilation/room temp.,"if it's cold in the room, i'd say low 30s(maybe even high 20s with a good cooler and really idle) would be normal.","if the room is warm, maybe mid to high 30s, maybe a little above 40 at times.","50 at idle is way too high for intel idle, and it's either your cooler, case, or even you have your process misconfigured, and it's drawing too much power at idle.",among other things like random resources eating up your processor in the background.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the price is still half of a decent aio that works for this cpu so that's not an issue for me.,"what i'm more worried about is that d15 was recommended by a lot of places in the beginning but then the same places started reporting issues people have with motherboards deforming, cpus bending and radiator plates loosing contact on lga1700.","this cooler was one of the most affected so i was thinking of getting dark rock pro, especially since i've been using be quiet's cooler in my current pc with great results.","but you're saying your temps are fine, right?",have you run any benchmarks?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

my guy what's with the salt?,you've posted in the past that you get better temps than i do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"he isnâ€™t salty, he find it hard to believe that you are getting the temps that you are.",the real thing is that the shitty mounting mechanism of the lf2 gives you a tiny little chance of getting it right.,"you may have gotten it right, however the amount of people complaining of bad temps with the lf2 on reddit far exceeds the amount of people with bad temps using any other aio.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"what about silent loop 2 360 for 12th gen,are this model is better then lf2",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my recommendations of alder lake cpus would go like this:

- 12100f - ultra cheap budget system
- 12400f - typical budget gaming system
- 12500 - lowest if you want to use igpu (12600 also possible)
- 12600k - well balanced gaming/work system
- 12700 - best high performance bang for your buck
- 12700k - high end, on a budget
- 12900k - high end, no budget

if thereâ€™s a f version of those higher chips you can go for those to save $20, but with the gpu market the way it is, i would never recommend the f as there are no downsides to having the igpu, and the cost savings is so minimal compared to potentially having the ability to use your system if the gpu fails, or needs to be troubleshooted.","plus, often the f are priced the same or even higher.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this generation is a little different than the previous.,"the 12600k is the first cpu in the lineup to get e cores, while the 12400 does not.","you're also getting .5ghz higher boost clock, which is a nice to have even if you're not overclocking.","i would say 12400 if you're sticking to a budget, 12600k if you're willing to spend a bit more for longevity.",either is fine on b660.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"12700k or if you want to save money, 12700kf.",you get nearly the same performance in gaming as a 12900k with less heat and power draw and itâ€™s almost $300 cheaper.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'd go for a 12600k non f. for gaming it'll get you just about the same performance as any of the higher end options, as well as the e cores, while not being super expensive.","i would never go for an f sku chip only because if your gpu dies or otherwise ever has issues, you won't have an igpu to fall back on, so unless the savings are significant, i'd just go for the regular k sku.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"honestly, i don't think you can go wrong with any of these options.","just consider how much you are willing to spend, and select accordingly.","personally, i think 6 p-cores is going to last a long time for 95% of pc users out there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to me the 12600 is the max to get its not a big jump going to the 129 or is it a big difference from 12400 of these chips compared to each other in single core programs they all mostly run the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

actually a 3080ti on max settings graphics can't give more than stable 144hz fps at 1080p.,talking about max ray tracing level too on most demanding games.,"and crysis remastered, well it's another story.","but i think a 2k 120hz monitor would be great, just level down some graphics settings which affects fps by alot but their change is not very much noticable and you will get really good detailing at 2k resolution for high fps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"no, it's not.",monitors are cheap as dirt and even gtx 1060 is enough to justify 1440p 144hz.,i've been using this combo for the last 2 years and found that it totally works.,"old games, indie games, and competitive games all benefit from higher res and refresh rate.",more demanding titles that are more focused on immersion still benefit from higher res even if the frame rate is lower.,and 1440p is just so much better everywhere else.,"you can watch higher resolution yt videos, you can display two documents on the screen much easier and if someone watches twitch they can display the image in a full 1080p resolution with chat right next to it.",applications like photoshop also work much better with higher  res.,so it's kinda hilarious that that guy with his 5.000 dollars pc is really getting a worse visual and user experience than someone like me with a pc that is many times cheaper just because he decided to pair it with a cheap monitor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

lol actually it depends on the kind of game it is.,"in the case of competitive shooters for example yes you can run any game at steady 240 fps with low settings at 1440p but people with super high end pcs when they play single player games with great visuals like metro exodus, cyberpunk, rdr2 etc... many of them end up playing at low fps but ultra settings and high resolutions.","i am running the same setup then this guy but with 32g of ram and i am currently playing dying light 2 at a cap 60 fps with some drops to the 50s depending on the area, game settings are 4k, dlss quality, everything on ultra with ray tracing and reflections on low.","in rdr2 i am currently at 45 - 50 fps with everything on ultra, 4k, dlss quality and dldsr 2.25x and while frame rate is low (g sync helps in this aspect a lot) is difficult to explain how good it looks.","is funny when you see people with high end pcs complaining about a game performance in reddit and other people replying things in the lines of ""why do you care if you have that kind of machine?""",just like people with low and mid gaming pcs people with high end pcs also have created expectations for how a game should run at certain resolutions and graphics settings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

one more gpu and 2 ssd's will make it faster and quicker.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the main takeaway from steve's video isn't that tubes top = bad but rather air in pump = bad and that you should minimize it.,the angle your pump has to push liquid is the key factor.,in this case liquid has to be pushed upwards a rather steep angle so there's a good chance air can accumulate inside the pump over time and thus fail earlier than it should.,this is highlighted in his many examples.,"if you change the orientation 90 degrees clockwise, you can largely reduce that risk.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

sorry but i dont know what intel xtu is.,i just disabled abt and set all core to 52 and vcore 1.46v in bios.,i have msi z590 mobo.,but i usually run it stock with abt enabled.,runs much cooler than 5.2ghz oc and no difference in gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it would probably throttle in synthetic benchmarks.,it can only cool safely up to 200 watts and since the 12900k can pull up to 240 watts i would say that the scythe fuma 2 would not be sufficient.,honestly i would be looking at a triple rad to cool that monster...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what about a 12600k?,fuma probably enough?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
200w?,i'm getting 90c @180w on a i7-12700k.,no case and i have the mount tightened per gamer nexus recommendation.,20c ambient,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
absolutely.,that's what i'm running and at max load in a warm room my temps stay around 74â°c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you should look into adding a third fan and replacing the second low profile fan.,is that your power consumption on a synthetic bench or normal use?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"r23, i'm idling at 40c, i have the newer fuma 2 that has faster fans, no change when tightening the cooler.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's been really stable for me.,all i had to do is buy the scythe mounting kit off amazon for like 6 bucks which wasn't much to ask imho,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tbh i think the only thing you could do to maybe decrease thermals is replace the fans and adjust the curves.,otherwise it doesn't seem that far fetched to see those kinds of temps on a scythe fuma 2. i'm sure when you are working normally or playing games it doesn't get anywhere near 90c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just got the kit today!,"it also looks like they developed a 2nd version, ""revb,"" but it is not yet available in the us.",i've also read that a stronger backplate can help combat the issue...and scythe's seems pretty strong.,i appreciate your reply.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not worth an upgrade from 12900 to 13900. the 12900k will hold its own for a good few years yet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably about half what you paid?,i'd suspect you'd be looking at $1000 in total for both procs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably $500.,so an $80-$100 loss.,intel cpus retain their value extremely well in the used market.,"to the point where it's typically a bad idea to buy an old used cpu, because they are still so expensive and you can buy a newer much better one for cheaper.",like the 9700k i used to have sells for $230 used and gets blown away by the cheaper 12400 and curb stomped by the slightly more 12600kf.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
450-500 bucks it sells for ~675 rn so then the new chip will be ~650-700 and youâ€™ll get 400-500 for your 12900k most likely.,shouldnâ€™t need a mobo upgrade.,youâ€™re asking for the future best i can do is approximate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thatâ€™s like me saying not worth upgrading from my 11700k i still have yet to get a game that has come close to utilizing this processor.,"regardless 13th gen is doubling e cores over 12th gen, improving memory support for faster baseline ddr5 support, introducing a new big core architecture to improve overall ipc, and tweaking power to draw less when in turbo power windows.",iâ€™m probably missing smaller bits but itâ€™s most definitely has reasons to upgrade 12th gen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they'll double ecore count on 13th gen. it'll definitely be better.,"the idea was always having the best of the best, not longevity.",otherwise op would have chosen the 12700k instead of the i9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i actually sold my 9900k for $330 and and found a 12700kf for $340 lol.,iâ€™d say thatâ€™s holding their value extremely well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

so when would you imagine a good performance gain?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you always have to have the best then fair enough but do you really think the performance increase will be that big between 12th and 13th gen?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

those little sff pcâ€™s are built with a specific chip in mind.,"the 6600k stock will still pull a lot more power than a t variant cpu (t variant denotes that itâ€™s a lower power draw chip)

"besides your 90w power supply being inadequate, and the cpu and case cooling being inadequate, and the motherboard design and vrm likely not being up to the task of reliably powering that cpuâ€¦ itâ€™s probable the bios doesnâ€™t support 90 watt parts for all of those reasons (thereâ€™s no reason for hp to add support for parts that they know would potentially damage the system).",hp provides detailed technical documents on all their products.,"you should look to see what the maximum cpu they officially supported was, and buy something in the same power requirement range â€” or only get something else that has already been determined to work reliably.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

older elitedesk 800 g1s have 135w and 180w power adapters.,it shouldn't be hard to find a used one since they are built like actual rocks and rarely fail.,as long as they are compatible.,but it's probably a bios thing not allowing higher than 65w parts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"honestly, i think it's just going to be compatibility with the cpu & the motherboard.",those two don't get along.,i may just end up trading off the 6600k for a normal i5 6500 65w.,that is on the cpu upgrade list for that unit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
b660 and h670 have less expansion options than z690.,"i'm talking pcie, sata, usb, etc.",not a big deal for most folks.,"even if you're not going to manually overclock, z690 boards are usually able to go further with xmp/mce or auto overclocking if you're into that sort of thing.","if you want the extra e-cores, slightly better igpu, and faster stock clocks there's nothing necessarily wrong with going 12600k and b660.",it's just an odd value proposition when the 12400 is cheaper and gets you 95% of the way there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you get a micro atx version compared to full atx you get less m.2 slots, as well as pcie port and sata port, but the main difference in general is just the pcie gen 5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"motherboards today are nothing more than a pcb extension to the cpu with power and some ports on it, because cpus are socs, nowadays.",so most of the people are throwing absurd amounts of money on a glorified pcb when they should actually invest that money in a better cpu.,the best example is the 5950x running on a a320 motherboard with absolutely no performance difference compared to a full fledged x570.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thanks for the advice yâ€™all.,"i think iâ€™m gonna do a bit more research, but either go more and get the 12700 or just wait and see on amd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you consider the 5800x?,"it's quite a jump in performance, and if your board supports it, it may be a cheaper option.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that isn't much of an upgrade.,you gain some per core performance but loose two cores.,for games that might make sense but for scientific applications usually you want a lot of cores too.,any reason you're looking at the 12600?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is there a reason you want the 12600 in particular?,they are seemingly all out of stock/preorder.,"the 12400 will get pretty much the same performance (worse igp, worse frequency) but otherwise the same.","so you could save money and get the 12400 or spend a little more and get the 12600kf which has more cores/threads, more cache, higher frequency and max turbo power.","as for h670, its not really a popular chipset, people tend to either get b660 or z690.","b660 makes the most sense for most people unless you have specific needs for more lanes, ddr5, etc, but most people dont need that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yea, i think the 12700f would be the one to get as itâ€™s a level above the 3700x.","also, i donâ€™t think thereâ€™s any more high performance am4 chips announced so if youâ€™re waiting for zen 4, it will be on a new motherboard as well.","however, you should calculate the cost of the cpu+ mobo of the intel platform against the cost of a 5900x if your motherboard supports 5000 series.",see if you could sell your older setup to get back some money as well.,prices will all depend on region so itâ€™s impossible for me to advise what you should get unless iâ€™m somehow in the same region as you.,in my region a 12700f+b660 is the same cost as a 5900x alone so itâ€™s really good value here.,go for the better price to performance choice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well after looking at the new intel cpus coming out, the 12600 seemed to be the best â€œbang for the buckâ€ so to speak.","the lower tiers didnâ€™t seem worth the upgrade, and the higher tiers just felt like the diminishing returns werenâ€™t worth the extra cost",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well i donâ€™t know how to overclock, so my friend that has intel told me not to go for a k processor.","they also told me that if iâ€™m not using a k chip, that h670 would be my best option",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m not â€œsetâ€ on the 12600. iâ€™m just looking for a good upgrade from the 3700x without having to spend 12900 level prices,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"maybe geology is different, but lots of scientific apps scale really well with core counts, and multicore performance is probably a wash.  from that point of view the 12600 isn't such a good value since for a lot of things it won't be much different than what you have.",(although of course you should look at benchmarks that are relevant to your work),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the big difference is the 12600 non-k doesn't have the 4 e-cores the 12600k has.,for a multi-core workload that will make a difference.,i'd you can stretch to a 12700 that's probably ideal.,2 extra performance cores compared to a 12600k and it comes with a cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i replied to another comment but forgot you are upgrading from a 3700x.,i would definitely go with the 12700 then unless you really are on a budget and need single core performance.,otherwise just stick with the 3700x til am5/13th gen intel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m not set on it.,just not sure which one is best for me?,"i wonâ€™t overclock, and i canâ€™t afford something that costs as much as an i9.",but i still want a good upgrade route,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i would either get the 12400 or the 12700. the 12600 non-k lacks the e-cores that the 12600k has, so to me it's not worth it over the 12400. and if you aren't overclocking, the 12700 would give a good boost over the 12600k for not much more money.","as for motherboards, i'm running the h670 pg riptide by asrock with my 12400. vrms aren't the best but should be fine for 12700k and below.",and it seems like it has a ton of features for only $150 compared to other h670/b660 and even some z690 options.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"futureproofing is a flawed concept, but sandy bridge was an exceptional generation.",the reason it lasted so long was because amd was irrelevant and intel had no competition and pushed out mildly improving quad cores for so many years.,those days are over and we've been seeing big jumps for the last couple generations on both amd and intel.,"with new pcie generations coming out, ddr5 rolling out, and windows 11 (which still needs optimization).",i guess my point is don't count on another 2500k again.,the safest bet would be going for something affordable like 12400/b660 and planning on upgrading again in 4-5 years.,if you're just gaming the difference between something like the 12600k and 12700k is pretty negligible with a few exceptions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you have the money id go for the 12700(f), its pretty affordable at $320 for the performance it gives, and with the way you've held onto your 2500k, think about it as costing you a few pennies per day for a better experience now and in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just get whatever you need today, don't bother with futureproofing as most of the time it ends up hurting the user more than benefits, like for example, people who thought that they were future proofing with their ryzen 7 8 cores 1st gen unnecessarily spending more for the sake of it, but 2 - 3 years later a 6 core variant of newer gen ryzens  easily smokes their 8 core on gaming.",they could have just spend less on their first cpu and upgraded to much faster ones later down the line.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12400f is good enough,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"went from 2500k (oc'd to 4.4ghz) that lasted me a decade to a 12400f here a few weeks back, and it's a noticable difference.","nobody knew sandy bridge would last so long, it's hard to predict where tech will be ten years from now.","if you game at all, i would say it's a safe upgrade for the rest of this console generation at least (ps5/xbox-sx) since it's definitely a stronger cpu that those.","12400f may only be a 6c/12t processor, but it's comparable or better in multicore performance to the ryzen 3800x which is 8c/16t.","single threaded it's going to be a huge difference, which a lot of tasks still are these days.","the 12400f is almost double the single thread performance of my old 2500k, despite the same clockspeed.","older games that're mostly single core and cpu limited i've seen frame rates pretty much double, which might also be due to the memory bandwidth for 3200mhz ddr4 being twice that of the 2500k's ddr3 at 1600mhz.","for newer games where i'm mostly gpu limited it's mostly the 1% lows that're much higher now, way less stuttering.",i haven't seen any games even get close to saturating all 12 threads to 100% like i would sometimes see with the 4 threads on the 2500k.,"if you do anything that can use all 12 threads like compressing files or compiling code the upgrade is amazing, literally 3 or 4 times faster.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

>but i am afraid even 6 cores will start running short soon.,"if by soon you mean 5-6 years at least then i can agree, go get an 8c/16t cpu.",the truth is 8c/16t is a massive overkill for gaming and most gamers won't notice a single frame of difference between 12900k and 12100f let alone 12400f unless they use unrealistically low resolution with a powerful gpu.,so you have nothing to fear.,in general there is a very clear trend among gamers to vastly overestimate what cpu they need.,"[https://youtu.be/mym5pkbb\_cy](https://youtu.be/mym5pkbb_cy)

i've yet to see a single example of a game that scales well with more than 6 threads.",some don't even scale well past the initial 4 threads.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not a flawed concept at all.,it's just that some dumb people think that spending 100% more on a 50% faster component is what future proofing looks like in which case it really doesn't make sense.,but consider getting ryzen 5 1600 over i5 7400/7500/7600k back in 2017 or i3 12100 over celeron g6900 now even if it's mainly for office work.,in first case we spend about the same amount of money and we end up with a platform that's slower at first but which has much more room for upgrades plus the cpu will age better.,nowadays r5 1600 is a better cpu in virtually every respect than those i5s it was competing against and depending on the exact mobo you're using you can upgrade it with the most modern amd cpus like 5800x.,"and to be precise, even some a320 motherboards allow for that kind of upgrade.","and in the second case we pay more for a cpu which may be an overkill now but because it's sooo much faster while not costing that much more, it's still very much worth it imho.",basically that celeron will likely struggle with word or excel soon enough meanwhile that i3 will effectively never run out of juice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

as a 2500k owner who still has my cpu and looking to upgrade to 12700k/12900k.,i would say the best place to answer your question is youtube.,look up i5 2500k vs i7 2600k.,just having hyperthreading gives the 2600k 50%-100% more fps on current gen gpu.,the difference right now will be minimal between 12400f vs 12900k but every year the difference becomes more clear in gaming.,in software the difference is huge.,anyway i love my 2500k but 2600k would have been a better purchase that would have lasted me longer.,12400f is bottom of the barrel and will only get you maybe... maybe 2-3 years before the difference gets massive.,12700k would be like 2500k would take 5-8 years to show it self in gaming.,12900k would be like 2600k.,sure there would be a difference but them little cores by then will be very useful as every one and thier mom will have little cores and will have programed for them cus both amd and intel will have big little cores in 2023 and moving forward.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would try to get in on the crucial 3200 32gb for $90 deal that's been all over bapcs the last couple months.,it's dual rank micron e-die and pretty easy to overclock to 3600c16 (i have mine running at that with a 12400 so stock voltages).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"between those two kits, the g.skill kit *is* the better kit.","based on the timings (cl16-16-16-36), can can deduce that it is using dual rank samsung b-die, and it would have a higher ceiling in terms of overclockability, but if you were to just run the two kits at basically ""stock"" xmp settings, you will probably not notice all that much of a difference between the two kits.","i would expect the g-skill kit to be able to overclock fairly easily to around 4000mhz (possibly higher, depending on the luck of the silicon lottery with the i7's memory controller) with tightened memory timings down to either cl14 or cl15 in gear 1 mode.","now, whether the fairly big price premium for the b-die based kit is worth it will mostly come down to whether you plan on spending the time to overclock and tune your memory.","off-hand, i don't know *how* much better the performance would get overall with tuned b-die in those particular games or whether it would be significantly noticeable without comparing them side-by-side with a frame rate counter up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™m sorry if this is a dumb question but super new to all
this things.",if i get a 3200 i can tweak it to do 3600 and keep the cas at 16?,would i see a big difference between the cas 16 and 18?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you may have to play with the timings a bit to run 3600. i had to set 16-19-19-36 for my set.,and no you probably won't notice any difference from any of these kits to be honest.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've never looked at these before but it's surprising to me that their best selling cpus are the flagships rather than the budget options.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"well, that was unexpected, not the fact that intel started selling well again compared to amd, but that i was expecting the i5 12400 to be the top of the chart not the i7 12700k, but according to this chart it's not even in the list so, i will assume that this is going to change in a few months time, when b660 motherboards and h610 availability and early adopter taxes eases off.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't get the subtext in the ad.,...your pc is running the what?,"the ""a beast""???",?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ryzen 5 5600x more expensive than i5 12600k?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no surprise especially on newegg.,"the price was just way too good when you're getting comparable performance to the 5900x and better performance in gaming and even though it isn't promoted as heavily, you get a code for dying light 2. i'm still looking to buy, but hoping for the microcenter price to go back to $300.",but that $500 for the 12900k is mighty tempting.,"ðÿ‘€

11th gen was embarrassing so seeing intel back in the ring is only good news for all of us.","now if only ddr5 and corresponding z690 mobos come down to sane levels, there would be little reason to go with zen 3 at this moment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

god i fucking love competition!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i thought it would be the 12600k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not suprising seeing how my 5900x is still getting usb disconnect issues.,really annoying to have a high-end desktop crap out like this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

holy shit 12600k is cheaper than 5600x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12700k is a no brainer if youâ€™re going 12th gen for just gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
new tech of course it is.,am5 will be here soon enough and they'll swap again.,this is far better for development then the stagnation we experienced in the early 2010s.,the sweet smell of competition.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ve been investing heavily into intel and everyone told me i was an idiot and that they were a dying company.,feels good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
isnâ€™t newegg a scam?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
isn't that mostly due to amd supply issues?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah great idea.,trade in performance cores that can process specific complex code for e-core arm type cpu's that can only do a few tricks.. but one of them is benchmarks.,and you have a pinto dressed up like a ferrari.. driving on city streets.,"show it a race-track though, and it's still a pinto.","works, as you don't need a ferrari on city streets, and few people drive on the race-track.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i think i saw somewhere that itâ€™s based off of the amount sold in terms of how much money people payed total for it, but i donâ€™t have a source for that and could be wrong",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think itâ€™s mostly because b660s took a while to come out and they were still expensive to begin with.,"the higher end of the market donâ€™t mind paying more for a z690, but the low end would probably prefer losing upgrade path by going with a 11400+b560 than 12400+b660 to have a better price to performance.",anyways the 11400f will be good enough for them to last through till ddr5 matures.,"itâ€™s probably why the 11400f is the best selling intel cpu in mindfactory over in germany, overtaking the 12700k by a margin there.",though prices will depend on region and iâ€™m guessing the 11th gen are a bargain over there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, i thought the 12400 would be in the top10 for sure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the budget options came out 5 minutes ago for intel and still don't really exist for amd.,"if the 5800x is $350 and the 5600x is $290, it's easy to argue for the 5800x.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you do not want to compare amd budget with intel budget chips sold through their partners.,chipzilla is no longer top of the stack.,"it's currently kimchizilla (samsung) and then chipzilla is #2. 

samsung has a good flash nand foundry game and they are a dangerously gigantic company.",just sneeze a little bit and samsung can overtake you.,intel can sneak one by samsung since all intel guys do are fab leading edge nodes and work closely with asml.,"so intel is very much a chipzilla... tsmc sells for apple, qualcomm, nvidia, intel and amd all good stuff.",mobile chips and all but intel is still holding strong in overall ic movement.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i was about to comment the same, the 5800x being #2 is also very surprising.","the 12400 and 12400f not being the #1 and 2# is amazing to me, they are absolute monster cpus for the price.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah, the a man of culture.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12700k has constantly been on sale on newegg so that should help to skew the results.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"feb 08 - 12400 rank 18, 12400f rank 24",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"haha, those are peoples' reviews that show up in the subtexts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
heck yes!,are you going to go for am5 or are you going to grab raptor lake with me?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12700k has been on sale for quite a while on newegg.,i'm sure that had nothing to do with it's sales success there...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

sandy bridge was the last banger intel really put out.,"i really liked the x99 platform too, as they allowed you to load xeons in that motherboard - when i replaced my 5820k with a 5900x last year, i ended up getting a cheap 12 core haswell based xeon for like $70, giving that system a few more years as a esxi system.",the stagnation has been pretty bad since then.,super excited to see both intel and amd trading punches again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

a ~$140 billion company isn't small and i never said it was.,just that intel is roughly double the size and should be able to easily compete with amd.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i don't think the boards affect performance when you only draw 55 watts.,the ryzen throttling is probably people trying out 100-plus watts ryzen 7/9s or overclocked ryzen 5s on low end boards (similar to how 11th gen intels may be throttled on some boards).,could it be people testing on safe mode so there's minimal overhead?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

>replyshare

the laws of thermodynamics do not change because you use a ddr4 version of the board.",also the power-delivery is literally identical.,watts cpu uses -> watts you need to dissipate.,a better motherboard will not make the cpu use any less power (although if you are using ln2 or something you can use more power than the entry level mobo can deliver thus you will just crash... or your vrm will throttle at like 120c),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and?,did your free mounting kit also take weeks to arrive at the minimum?,"tell you what, some of us here actually need pc to work and can't possibly wait that long for all the parts to be ready",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> a better motherboard will not make the cpu use any less power

various mobo vendors have *very* different stock bios behavior.","msi bios factory defaults like to send way too much voltage to cpu (like 1.4v+ peaks on 12th gen when it only needs 1.25 stock)

you are completely correct on the thermodynamics, but you have to account for the scourge of...marketing and cheating benchmarks.","and yes a user can fix those problems, but most people won't and the mobo's obfuscate what settings do.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ok thanks, but if want to upgrade gpu later, what would the i3 12 gen be enough for before bottleneck?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a 3070ti or 3080. it wouldn't bottleneck much even if it did,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it should support 13th gen (i.e.,raptor lake) afaik.,because intel usually offers 2 years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it supports 12th gen and will almost certainly support 13th gen raptor lake.,i doubt it will support 14th gen though.,intel historically only supports 2 gens each cycle.,"raptor lake is going to have double the e cores, higher ipc and more cache across the board for gaming improvements.",that said a 5600x might be a cheaper choice to limo you along until 14th gen intel or give you time to see what amd has to offer at the end of the year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it'll support 13th gen for sure with engineering samples already floating around.,intel have also hinted that it'll most likely support 14th gen and perhaps even more.,they're looking to break the two generations per socket design pattern.,"but that said, no one knows for sure beyond 13th gen at this stage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unless you plan on moving to ddr5 iâ€™d upgrade to a 5600x.,far cheaper option.,"i had a 3800x but my wife wanted my pc so i went intel with the 12700k and couldnâ€™t be happier, had she not needed my pc i wouldâ€™ve got a 5800x.",i also have a 3060ti and i noticed a big improvement over the 3800x including way better 1% lows.,youâ€™ll probably see more of a difference at 1080p over my 1440p display.,ignore that other guy claiming you wonâ€™t notice a difference on a â€œweakâ€ gpu.,he clearly doesnâ€™t know what heâ€™s talking about.,this experience should be similar on the 5800x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5600x if the mb supports it and upgrade to something new when ddr5 matures.,or you can sell it and add 50$ at most and get a 12400 and mb.,it will be a slight gaming bump and allow you to upgrade to a 13600 with double the cores and better ipc.,"with raptor lake, meteor lake, zen 4, rdna 3, rtx 4000 and much faster ram all a year away there is no point in buying an expensive cpu now unless you intend on actually using it ( so not for games )",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"go to the manufactor page of the motherboard you want and it will list cpu, ram, and harddrive compatability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you know if raptor lake will be a significant upgrade over alder lake?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
end of the year / maybe even next year.,"from past releases, they usually release the high-end parts first which will be quite expensive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> that it'll most likely support 14th gen and perhaps even more

that would be **great** but i slightly doubt it based on past boards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks.,"i was wondering... if i switch the platform to z690, instead of just going for 5600x... would you call that a good investment?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i follow leaks a lot, even knew i was buying alder lake two years in advance.","raptor lake will be about 10-15% ipc improvement, expect closer to the lower end of that.",the benefit comes from the double e core count across the product stack.,"so if you have heavy multithreaded workloads like large compiles or renders, then yes.","for gaming, i wouldnâ€™t bother upgrading if you have a 12700k+, otherwise if you have extra money and want to splurge you could.","big improvement on the next pair of processors, meteor and arrow lake.","meteor lake will be really big, but if arrow lake is ready for their royal cores, it would be the biggest update in x86 history.",tldr: if you have money it could be good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"by the time raptorlake releases, msft would have had a year+ of updates for win 11 os scheduling.",sort of like big.little 2.0. things should get better year over year as they learn and optimize more.,sort of like how phones have gone from half day battery life to full day battery life.,with big and little cores.,or 1 really fast core and 4 medium speed and 4 slow speed.,etc... many combinations are possible across the whole stack now.,i recall reading somewhere that intel and msft are looking to push towards how ipad and mobile phones are able to instant sleep and instant wake up.,and have multi day idle/sleep battery life.,that's something current windows laptops cannot do.,so it is where things are going with these new alder and raptor lake chips.,along with wins 11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"like i said 5600x or 12400.

it will be a decent upgrade ( you don't have an extremely powerfully gpu so less of a difference ).",it depends on price in your area.,the 12400 has an upgrade path to raptor lake so i would go with that if its less than 50$ difference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no way to tell that.,intel is notorious for using a chipset for each cpu.,"if you want something more future proof, i would go with amd.","they used same am4 socket for like 4 or 5 generations of cpu, but the havent verified for the new socket.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

support for next generations on am4 is over.,they will release a new platform this year.,i already have a **ryzen 3600x** and i can only upgrade to **5800x** or **5600x** but **12600k** is better than both in gaming it seems...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes thats what i said.,not very powerfull so less of a difference.,if it was a 6900xt it would have been more.,but its a solid upgrade for 50$.,if you play cpu bound titles like csgo it will be even better.,but for 144hz screen its more than enough.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
z690 will support 12th gen alderlake.,"so i3, i5 12600k, i7 12700k, and i9 12900k

and we look to get a special mid product refresh in the i9 12900ks the ks will apparently boost to 5.5 ghz stock!","after alderlake is coming raptor lake later around q4 2022. we should see stock around q4 2022 but it might leak into q1 2023.

raptor lake should be an optimization on the 10nm enhanced superfin or intel 7. so just more cores and some optimization to improve performance!",after raptorlake will come the really exciting stuff!,intel 4. but amd will be releasing their good stuff later this year also!,those will be on tsmc n5 which should be more mature now.,intel 4 should meet or exceed tsmc n5 and will be a bit delayed.,but it is close enough to compete with amd products.,no one has touched apple m1 lead yet however.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"considering you have an x570 you might actually be better off selling the 3600 and mb for 200-250 and buying a 12400 and b660 board for 300-350

some games may stutter cause the p cores are always parked on idle and half of them are still parked when gaming.,"i've experienced stutter with e cores on win10 and when disabling them, all were unparked and run just like in windows 11. you acan see it in task manager and change the graph option to see all cores separatly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not anybody can pull off these kind of speeds and timings.,"also, it's such a blind question to ask, we don't even know how many dims your mobo has and it's mostly a silicon lottery and being good at overclocking to pull these numbers off.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probs for like 500 plus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why does it say quad channel?,is it a bug of aida?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you probably meant to say ddr4 4000, right?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if it isn't used it's a waste of money.,my previous platform was quad-channel and it was pointless for the same reason.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you sure it wasn't the new cpu?,or did you have a ddr4 alder lake motherboard first.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2nd slot?,why's that?,"its currently in the first one, a1.","edit: you're right, it needs to be in a2.",i swear i check the manual before i did this.,edit2: so it really was in a1 and i just changed it to a2.,"boots perfectly fine with xmp i. thanks man, was going to wait for bios updates, but turns out that doesn't fix stupid.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ddr4 wasn't crazy expensive on launch when compared to ddr3.,"ddr5 is crazy expensive even compared to high end ddr4, ddr5 isn't impressive yet nor beneficial for the majority enthusiast.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not good quality ddr4 which is still more then twice as cheap.,20-30% in latency is not a few nanoseconds.,good quality ddr5 for 32gb is nearly 500 when you can get 32gb 4000mhz good timings for 150 and run in gear 1...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and my ddr4 kit can hit 4800 in gear 2 and get 70,000 in aida read.",and my kit isn't even the best ddr4 bin.,"ddr5 isn't posting 140,000 reads so double is beyond a stretch.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
only high end ddr5 does some taks better and it still loses in latency sensitive tasks.,most ddr5 still loses to good quality ddr4 at half the price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i stand corrected.,i would tighten tras down to the 40s and lower twr to close to the same amount.,you would have like <50ns latency or something insane.,tfaw is also an important timing(i went from 32 - > 18),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
those are micron rev.e sticks that are single rank.,([https://www.legitreviews.com/crucial-ballistix-elite-ddr4-4000mhz-memory-review\_214072](https://www.legitreviews.com/crucial-ballistix-elite-ddr4-4000mhz-memory-review_214072) ) the max frequency he got to boot was 4400 cl18.,at this speed your dimms had 59% read speed of mine.,you got 324mb read/$ vs 249 mb read/$.,(used newegg pricing for those dimms and used the price i got my dimms at) so you got roughly 30% better value.,the value difference between a 12700k vs 12900k is way worse.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in my knowledge along with latency la cache is super fast.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but what about real world benchmarks?,other than compression/decompression ddr5 shows no real gains over ddr4.,certainly not gains that are worth the cost.,"and in games, often ddr4 is *faster*.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i thought gamers nexus said that there's a measurable difference, but it's so small that most people won't notice; and the current cost of ddr5 makes it only worth it for professionals who need to save every second of processing time that they can.",i could easily be wrong about this though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yes, one of the things they changed with ddr5 was they split the channels of each stick into two, to increase the memory's ability to allow better access to their pool.","so, technically 2 sticks is now ""quad channel"".",(edited: autocorrect to/too/two'd me).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's a dumb comparison and hardly proves him incorrect.,memory bandwidth is hardly ever the limiting factor and when it is it's at vary high frame rates with top of the line gpus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"on daisy chain topography motherboards the traces on channel a make a junction with slot 1, then continue on to slot 2. ram in slot 2 therefore properly 'terminates' the traces.","if you put ram in slot 1,the signal continues to the end of the trace and an empty junction, where it 'reflects' and adds noise to the entire signal path.","that's why you always terminate the ram signalling pathway with ram in the 'last slot on the line' first, adding additional sticks at the 'stop off point' where the traces are already terminated by the otehr ram stick.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there it is.",iâ€™ve installed from that link before itâ€™s legit.,edit: if you can run tm5 anta777 extreme overnight without errors 6-9 cycles at 1500% then you are probably stable.,tm5 errors also give some indication what is causing said error.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

> it's still better than nothing that consumers have gotten for years.,if you can from ddr3?,sure it was.,because even ddr4 had multiple ecc features implemented.,just like ddr5 included more.,but its still not what we consider real ecc memory.,"the drive to ecc consumer memory has not been motivated by good will of the companies but by introducing ecc features, they are able to sneeze more valid memory sticks out of a production run.",memory that was considered unstable ( and unsellable or high return rates ) was more stable at the cost of the constant error correcting.,its the same reason why we do not have real on-chip ecc in consumer hands because that is a increased cost.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can you site a source providing rationale and evidence to back up your claims?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
except fast ddr4 usually saturates the bandwidth needed like for gaming so lower latency is best in most scenarios,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

also you memory controller is clocked 27% slower....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, but the test for throughput isn't as easy to get right, especially as every cpu has a different cache structure.","what causes cache contention on one cpu may not on another, and it could have to reach out to l2.",the latency test (ideally) should be unaffected by that contention.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
up the voltage to 1.4v dram and 1.35v cpu vddq and vdd2 to 1.4v set system agent to 1.2v.,that should easily post.,from there set the primary timings to 30-36-36-42. twr should be 48 or lower.,set tfaw to 18.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also what cpu are you running?,amd's memory controller caps out at 3800mhz.,so your best best  if you were to be on amd platform would be  3800mhz cl14.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well i was able to get to 4000 c15 with one click xmp haha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
although those sub channels donâ€™t behave exactly the same way the primary channels do.,itâ€™s more like a semi-quad channel.,it allows sending data over those 32 bits while still waiting for the rest (the other 32 bits) to get ready.,but they are still dependent on each other.,the main memory channels are truly independent.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s a measurable difference which by practice cannot be dumb.,csgo has always been like this and yes it is at very high very frame rates with a high end gpu.,the increase was from 500fps to 670fps at the same settings with a 3080.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i've tested it extensively myself.,it's a *big* difference.,the 0.1 and 1% lows are what you notice: it's stutters and hitches that disappear with dual channel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

xmp is a lot different that manually tweaking the sub timings and overclocking the ram.,"obviosuly it will post at xmp that's no surprise but your ""cl15"" is more like 15-16-16-39 something like this at stock xmp, tightening the sub timings is where the higher performance lies, like for instance at 4100mhz cl14 you'd preferrably be at 14-14-14-28. i highly recommend watching a guide because clearly you're obviously new in the overclock scene.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in practice it dumb and you didn't refute my statement,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2 and 4, then fill 1 and 3. but check motherboard manuals, if you've got t topology it might be different.","you want to split the channels for dual channel operation, even with ddr5.",that's the single biggest ram performance boost you can get.,"so you do 2 and 4 first, not 1 and 2.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yup this is the truth.,1% lows are really the most important to keeping a consistent experience.,60 fps average with 1% lows at 15 will feel noticeably worse to play than 30 fps avg with 1% lows of 28. simply because the fps will be more consistent.,itâ€™s why i hate when reviewers only show averages and minimums.,1% lows is where the real performance is at.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there 18 19 19 39 stock but can be tightened if you shooting for lower frequency.,that's not bad for 4000 speed and i'm running mine at 4100 in gear 1. i've read that most can do 4000 in gear 1 so that's why i went for xmp 4000 speed for convenience.,my memory controller maxed out at 4100 and so i simply lowered my timings at 4100 speed to 17 18 18 36.,50ns latency.,63000 read 6100 write and 63000 copy.,i've read b die is heavily binned.,that last stuff you linked is djr which is good for price to performance but it's usually not as good as micron rev b that i linked.,good luck!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
those 2 kits are really nice but you won't get the most out of them if you don't like to tinker with timings.,"also significantly more expensive, i'd go with micron rev b or the djr as they're way more performance for price.",also those gskill kits can be loose with the heatsinks so some put them in the oven to get better contact.,lol i wouldn't want to do that specifically if you shell out for that b die.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19 19 19 43 was for 4400 mhz.,i'm talking about 2x 18 19 19 39 32gb kit.,also the 4400 kit is better binned so if you brought it down to 4100 or your max stable memory controller speed you would have even better timings if you manually tune,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

like a scenario where a normal hardware enthusiasts/gamer would benefit from ddr5 'ecc'.,pretty sure there's plenty of good reasons as to why it was never adopted for mainstream users and reserved for servers with sensitive data that's usually quite massive for volatile memory and 24/7 runtimes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

don't some motherboards switch the position of a and b channels.,a friend of mine has an asus prime z370-a and a2 is the 4th slot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the tech is fundamentally the same and have the same random errors per byte-hours of operation.,there are 2 primary reasons why it hasn't been adopted in the consumer market.,"consumers are far more price sensitive than corporations, and intel decided ecc support was a premium feature since things work well enough without it.",so low consumer adoption rates.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there's always odd cases though, hence 'read your manual'.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the problem with 16gb which is all a gamer needs is you won't find it in dual rank which gaming benefits from.,you can always add 16gb later but who knows what ics you'll get even you buy the exact same kit.,just look for 4000 xmp low timings.,if you want to spend a lot try b die finder.,"best bang for buck imo is micron rev b, then micron rev c then djr.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you can set a power limit in bios.,power is very strongly correlated with vrm temps.,"so for loads that draw a lot of power, if you set power limits (pl1 and presumably pl2 and tau) correctly, you will see a clock reduction on very heavy ongoing loads that will heat up your vrms considerably; for lesser ones, or more intermittent loads, you will not notice a difference.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think the desktop you have is a dell inspiron 3880 since it has a 200w psu with an optional 260w psu.,you probably should have spent more and bought an xps desktop with a larger psu if you didn't want to build your own diy system.,"about the only gpu that would probably work would be a gt 1030 with gddr5, and even that's cutting it close with 200w.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with a 200 w psu you can forget about gpus.,and within that price you should probably look for used gpus or rtx 3050 at best if you can find a good deal on it.,and definitely not 6500 xt!,with a pcie3-only cpu it shouldn't be considered.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1650,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4gb ram?,dude..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
something 75w so no extra power connector.,1650 most likely.,it will play anything on low.,and 4 more gb of ram.,your budget should be ok.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can you upgrade that power supply?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got an hp i3-10100 w/ a 180w psu coming in today.,i will drop in a gtx 1650 and run some prime95 and furmark and report.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what's with psu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no i'll be upgrading it to 16 or 32 gb,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"dell likes to use proprietary parts, so probably not.",probably also can't take the whole system and put it a different case that holds a standard psu because the mobo is also most likely custom.,fuck dell.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're a man of culture,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i had an old optiplex in 2010, it sucked bigtime thanks to those proprietary parts, but i was able to squeeze in an upgraded psu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so far, it's survived 5 minutes of torture.",(it's a refurb with about 10 months on the hard drive.,these little hps are pretty nicely laid out and seem to have good airflow.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so perfectly stable after an hour.,i think you'd be okay with a 75w or even 90w gpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12600k would be a better option imo.,"for gaming and stuff, you could even get away with the 12400/f with a b660.","overall, 12th gen offers much better value",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12600 or 11700 if you can get it for 200.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea i really wasnâ€™t sure if i truly even needed the i7 for what iâ€™m going to be using my pc for thatâ€™s why i started exploring the i5 options,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12600k would be $249.99 whereas the 11700k would be $269.99,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you rly should stop thinking about intel cpus in terms of ""i5"", ""i7"", ""i9"" bullshit.",i5-12600k is better than i9-11900k.,"both in multi-core and single core performance, gaming performance and in power efficiency.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
explore the 12th gen lineup.,it's a good option,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes 12600k is better and has an upgrade path.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ll buy one for sure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it looks promising, but there is nothing else to say.",it seems though that the high end part is slipping into q2.,might also be the reason why in the earnings call they indicated near zero revenue growth.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i hate amd products after using them for so many years, worse performance and buggy drivers.",but trading your 6800?,"i donâ€™t know if thatâ€™s a great idea, unless of course there are too many problems with it.",we still donâ€™t know if arc will be a solid entry from a compatibility and stability perspective.,"iâ€™ll likely get one to upgrade my 1070, not sure if you need one though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am looking forward to trying it out and will probably put it into a small form factor build to hopefully take advantage of it's rumored low power draw in a tiny case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
where did intel backtrack on q1?,"laptops with arc are hitting end of q1 and it only takes an official announcement and unveiling to launch them, could easily see a late match launch.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"looks interesting, if it's not vapor, or impossible to buy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m interested but the 1st year will be hard and buggy with the drivers.,i hope there is driver support for mac os for hackintosh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

iâ€™m stuck with an ivy bridge i5 and i donâ€™t plan to change it as it works like a charm.",but my old 270x lacks vram â€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's gonna suck in performance and drivers.,maybe a few years down the line they get something closer to what nvidia or amd offer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
where is it?,or does it plan to compete with nearly 2 year old tech?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah they backtracked on q1 so i'm assuming it won't hit the market until at least q2.,i would be more excited but feel that they will fall victim to the same supply woes as amd.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's sad because back in the ati days, radeon was king.",how the mighty have fallen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've had many of both throughout the years.,"the 6850 was great, cheap, and awesome for crossfire.","however, they drivers have always been a pain.","still, i'd love to see more competition.","my foolish dream is that it will outperform my 1080ti enough to upgrade, be widely available, and reasonably priced.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i took a gamble with my 5700xt 2 years ago and amd managed to get that card stable with just 2 driver updates.,the card wasn't popular because of the driver stability issues present at launch and because of this amd charged on average 100 less than the 2070 super despite the fact that the 5700xt was able to trade blows with it.,i guess what i'm say is i'm willing to wait for the drivers to be fixed if it meant i could sell my card and pocket a little bit of money for a card that had temporary/fixable issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i dont expect intel first gen on discete gpu to compete with lastest flagship.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it plans to target the current midrange.,not old tech.,i personally feel that it will be similar to amd's release of rdna1 cards wherein their goal is to iron out the drivers in hopes of being able to compete at the high end by 2023.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i know a lot of people who would happily get the high end arc iteration if itâ€™s priced reasonable compared to competitors and the performance somewhere between a 3060ti and 3070ti.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they didn't backtrack on q1.,"even after the website change reviewers asked intel and they said it's still q1, they have posted more videos and content since that say q1.",however it's likely limited laptop release in late q1 and dgpus in early q2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i highly doubt they will have supply issues tbh.,"i think early january ""moore's law is dead"" said that intel are stockpiling for a massive release.","he said his guess is that intel will have 500k gpus on release, in early q2.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i had an ati radeon 9800 pro for a really long time, it was a beast.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it doesn't even need to.,"as long as availability and price are good (which remains farfetched in the current situation) and if there no major bugs, it's already a success (big xe is rumored to compete with the 3070 which would be amazing already honestly)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
only the price will tell.,they seem to be hyping it up against the other high end offerings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did see that they had some ludicrous amount of vram they have been stockpiling as well.,here's to hoping.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for sure.,their highest end model which is supposed to deliver 3070ti performance is rumored to cost around $840.,"this is pretty expensive but would unfortunately be considered a good deal compared to the 3070ti which is listed at $1,200 on ebay.",this is of course assuming that they have any stock to sell at msrp.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
where did you get 840$ from?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the intel xe scavenger hunt.,"they basically said that the highest prize tier would include the ""premium"" arc gpu (presumably the highest end graphics card) along with 6 months of xbox game pass.",with a combined value of 900 dollars.,so you subtract 60 dollars for game pass and are left with 840.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well no, there is also swag included in this, that alone could cost 200 usd.",but someone or me will post details once we get our prizes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it's an internship, it depends entirely on role.",your referrer is the best person to ask.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what role is it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the interview process is totally dependent on the hiring team.,most likely it will be conducted over microsoft teams.,the process for interns is often pretty light.,"on my team we may only have 1 or 2 people interview them and then make a decision; the bar to getting hired is low, because the risk of an unsuccessful intern is also low.","my recommendation would be to email the interviewer ahead of time and ask what topics they'll be covering, and then study up on that area.",best of luck to you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i donâ€™t want to be an asshole, but youâ€™re not resourceful and did zero research.",just go on glassdoor or a similar website and there are hundreds of interview experiences posted.,you can even break it down by region.,youâ€™re going to have a hard time if you need this much hand holding and direction.,the intel website probably breaks down the interview process as well regarding these steps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the role is of business analyst intern,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for the response.,really appreciate your efforts and suggestions.,thank you once again â˜ºï¸,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for the response.,it is my first time interviewing with intel.,just want to know how each stage of the interview is like.,what process do they follow in general and things like that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the response.,"but i would say that's a huge presumption to say i didn't do any research on my own or checked glassdoor, indeed etc.",it always help to ask people about their experiences.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looks like a program management or project management position with agile / scrum experience.,may require experience in creating grantt chart and other project schedule and quality management methodologies.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you can check [intel's website](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000057098/processors.html) for warranty details using the serial number of box or the cpu itself and that's also where you can confirm if it's genuine or not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no cpu is 100% made in china/vietnam/..., the final parts are just put together in these countries because of cheap labor.","even if all they do is put on the heatspeader then chinese law says it has to say ""made in china"".",also china is trying to learn/steal info how to make their own processors but are unable to because a processor is so small that they can't open it and copy the insides lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"im pretty sure that means the packaging, intel cpu is made in their fabs",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they are being made in china and vietnam.,iâ€™ve had a 12900k from china and one from vietnam.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"everything is made in china, its no longer a clue for cheap assembly or something like that.it is much cheaper for the e-corps out there to hire factories that will take care of this stuff, so they choose countries from that area ( mostly china but as mentioned also vietnam and such ) over other places.",the faster you realize that the easier it will be to digest :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have to say i am looking forward to the american foundries and see how those will stack up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it did recognize the serial nr and batch.,"warranty lasts until 2025.

thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
english used this way to discriminate american 100 years ago.,just another turn of no.2 is replacing no.1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how did those ones turn out for you?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hmm... intel 12th gen processor dies are made in intel fabs either oregon, arizona or israel.",they are not made in any foundry like tsmc.,packaging though as people have noticed isn't done at the same place and despite intel products being packaged in china all of the critical steps (think intellectual property) arent.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
by no.1 i guess that you mean that china will become the best designers of microchips?,"that is impossible, china's current economy is based on copying others and making it cheaper because of lower taxes and laborcosts.",wich is becoming increasingly more difficult because of higher wages and growing distrust in the chinese government by other countries and companies.,so if they continue doing it that way they can never be no.1.,the problem with processors is that they are one of the most complex things ever invented.,and it takes decades of experience to become good at it.,that is why companies like intel and amd closely guard their technology and the factories that make these chips are very few and very secure.,but let's say that if china invades the country taiwan and steal tsmc's factory then they still don't have the knowledge to improve on what they have stolen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
theyâ€™ve all been within margin of error of each other.,"all a silicon lottery, really.",donâ€™t stress that it was made in china.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why did you get dv'd for this?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think they will do everything in the us, since china-us relationships are frozen and they see chips as a strategic resource (as they should).",giving china any info on how your cpus are made is obviously a risk.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i agree with you about almost everything you said.,except for the fact that china couldn't get there hands on intel or amd's technology.,the people's liberation army of china literally has spy's go into companies that they setup with all the proper educational background etc just to steal tech like this.,"that along with a 100,000 manned hacker army they could just go after the home laptops of the engineers themselves.",my point being if china wants it they can get it.,"they have the resources, man power, and the money to obtain whatever the hell they want!",they've literally been doing everything i've said for the past 25 years.,"their hackers have also shown they can cross any airgap created for security reasons, like inside of intel or amd.",so offline systems mean nothing for security.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"after usa invade texas , california, florida, all south provinces, and west germany invade east germany,i don't think there is any problems if china invaded taiwan.",if you think unification is invade.,i guess you should go to learn english and history.,"china also invaded, tianjin, beijing, shanghai, guangdong in 1946. did you see any problems now ?oh,  sorry ,california, and texas are really invade , took from mexico.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can think it is impossible.,but your think can not stop anything.,"keep thinking,and keep steam.lol.",english was thinking same way in 100 ago.,"when china ruled the world thousands years, american had not founded yet.","exception is always exception, all suitations will be back to normal as long as the time period is long enough.",have you heard the himalayan is liquid ?,i guess you can not understand.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good question lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
packaging isn't done in usa.,during packaging  there isn't anything connected to manufacturing the features on the wafer.,when the product gets to china it's already made.. just needs to be diced (relatively low tech) and packaged (intel has some ip here but it's not at the same level as wafer processing).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then let's hope they keep improving their security.,don't give the ccp too much credit.,they want us all to think they are so amazing at everything but from what i know they mostly hack into older systems.,"because again, they can only copy what already exists.",inventing something new isn't what they do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no i can not understand half of what you say.,try to improve your own english before you comment on this site.,"you act like chinese domination is inevitable... ancient china was cool, new

"12100 really is entry level, even though its a good cpu for what it is, i wouldnt recommend it with the stuff youre doing.","i'd go for the 12400 of the two, and depending on how much work youre doing with modeling and game development, might suggest you try to stretch for the 12600k(f), its not much more than the 12600 which you say you might save for and gives you more threads, higher boost, and more cache, and should age way better.","as for w10 or w11, performance wise it doesnt matter much, especially on the 12400. some new security features do slow the cpu down a few percent but its not really noticeable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
could you buy a weaker cpu now 12100. then sell it and buy a raptor lake cpu later.,i think raptor lake would suit your cpu productivity needs even better than alder lake so dont invest too much into a cpu right now.,you can save the cash now and monitor how demanding your workloads are.,you would be able to make a better informed cpu choice through use.,one other small thing is i would recommend a 1080p 144hz monitor minimum.,the cost today on higher refresh monitors are quite cheap compared to a few years ago.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the cpu boosts higher than 4.5ghz out of the box.,so youâ€™d be downclocking the cpu.,as for temps iâ€™m not sure as i have a 360mm aio.,"iâ€™d imagine the temps at stock would be ok, but overclocking with around 1.3v would probably get toasty.",your case airflow and ambient temps would also be a factor to consider.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

nice!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
temperature you experiencing is nothing extreme for 12900k.,cpu is a beast and power it consume is crazy.,im on noctua nh-15 bo and on heavy gaming (battlefield 2042 all maxed out) it easily heatens up to 76-78 degrees.,"however, smaller games like dota2 or cs won't make many troubles.",while idling its around 40 degrees for me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"buddy with the exact same build as me other than his cooler(ruijin 2 360) came with the lga 1700 brackets has idle temps of 31-33 and under load(gaming) temps in the mid 50's with spikes into the 60's....even just sitting here with nothing but chrome running while i post this on reddit my temps are holding steady at 45-47 with all 3 cooler fans running at 60% speed...

"considering intel set the throttling temperature at 105c on one hand, and giving you three years warranty on the other, you shouldn't worry about 90",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so what is your ambient temp?,what is your pl1 limit and idle temps?,what is your cpu temps on games generally?,are you using lga 1700 or lga 1200 mounting kit?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok thank you!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do not try this on laptops with extremely hot temperatures for a long time.,i have bluescreened mine/ not stable anymore now due to long use with hot temperature (90c while gaming).,the cpu might be fine on laptop but the chipset and the vrm might not like this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no i wasnâ€™t overclocking i was loading into a minecraft world and on power plan was set to max performance but now i changed it to two balanced no i wouldnâ€™t stress my cpu as much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""intel 12th gen cpus are designed to run at up to 100 degrees celsius"" - may i ask where you got that info from?",would be interesting if this is really officially communicated.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"honestly, if you are worried about heat and cpu stress from playing minecraft, you have no business running a 12700 system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is nothing to worry in temp wise.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
quick question what approximate temperature does a cpu need to be to get damaged,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well... its hard to say actual temp range when it gets damaged.,i've seen cpu:s hitting here and there when doing oc/benchmark 105c to 110c and still working many years after that.,generally speaking its usually said anything above 100c can damage cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"a 4790k, but its not worth it at all.","used they go for $130, and its not a meaningful upgrade for you.","if you have the money, its time to upgrade to a modern cpu, even a $100 i3-12100 will double your performance, but the caveat is youll need a new board ($85 for h610 or $95 asrocks entry b660) and ddr4 too ($50 2x8gb 3200mhz).",so you'd be looking at $250 to double your performance.,or $350ish to triple it with a 12400(f),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sadly, a 4790k",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no point in keeping that motherboard, you're throwing good money after bad.",keep it until you need an upgrade and then replace the cpu/motherboard/ram all at once.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you are paying retail price for 4790k itâ€™s probably much more cost effective for a brand new motherboard, cpu ram combo.",retail price is running about $250 to 400. with that same cost a combo from newegg or microcenter will get 5600g with a b550 motherboard.,"https://www.microcenter.com/product/5005029/amd-ryzen-5-5600g-with-wraith-stealth-cooler,-msi-b550-mag-tomahawk,-cpu-motherboard-combo

the price you pay for an upgrade on your same mobo is not worth it.,buying a 12100f and the cheapest mobo you can get is probably way more economical.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your 4790k is stronger than my ryzen 5 2600 and i cna max out and have above 70fps on any triple a title with rtx 2070 on 3440x1440p.,i'd say just save money for now and wait until newer tech comes out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

broad sweeping generalised comments about brands are often unhelpfulnand simply help feed people's misconceptions on brands.,all 4 of those companies make some great products and some poor products.,"i've owned some msi boards that have been absolute rubbish then been ok with software fixes down the road (so people buying early would report rubbish, later would report great), other msi boards ive owned have simply remained rubbish.","some gigabyte boards i've owned have been amazing, i've also owned some gigabyte boards that were rubbish.",i could go on but i think i've made my point.,with motherboards it comes down to the individual board model and even the state of software/firmware at that the time not just brand.,you've omitted two brands which can be outstanding particularly in their more cost-effective options.,it's easy to become biased for/against a brand but ultimately that just harms your options (and others if you spread that without firm justification).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

another vote for msi.,went with the carbon and it's been a fantastic experience out of the box.,gigabyte is the only one i'd say stay away from.,initial bios doesn't even let you install your os onto a m.2 drive so it has to be updated and i and many others have only had problems with memory xmp support.,"it's too bad because my previous mobo was the master x570 which was great, but if you check out r/gigabyte , it's just constant issues and extremely poor rma service.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i sort of regret getting a ddr4 board.,it looks like intel want to support lga 1700 for the long term.,13th gen will be lga 1700 with support for both ddr4 and ddr5.,14th and 15th gen will be lga 1700 but there are doubts about whether they will retain support for ddr4.,but if you don't plan on upgrading your cpu for the next 4 or so years then ddr4 is fine with little real world performance differences since the timings on these early ddr5 modules are quite loose.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have the asus z690f.,"i bought two heros, both of which were subject to the recall.","i'd love a high-end board, but not sure what to get.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have always used msi.,and i just got my tomahawk and 12700k a few days ago.,and i'm happy with it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think iâ€™m set on the edge i read many forums complaining about the strix ddr4 oc issues,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
+1 no complaints with mine either.,well built too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how hot does it get though ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"out of curiosity, what gpu are you running and can you confirm if it's running in with all 16 lanes or if it's running at 8x.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the a pro seems very good for its price and i see plenty of them on amazon used no idea why though.,maybe rgb fans donâ€™t like it lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love mine so far.,got the ddr5 w/ wi-fi.,"was easy to setup, no issues whatsoever.","no rgb but yeah, i knew that going in.",rgb alone seems to drive the price way the fuck up.,$249.99 for a mobo was already pretty horrendous.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's great.,haven't had any issues can't see why people would return it unless they needed bluetooth or wifi.,it works out of box which is more than other brands can claim atm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm using the msi pro 690-a ddr4.,seems pretty solid so far for a $220 board.,"win11 did not have a driver for the intel lan so i had to use a usb to ethernet adapter to install windows, but there are other ways to get the drivers installed without that if you google it.","i'm on a 12700k, 3090 custom water loop.","all my fans go through an octo and rgb is controlled by lian li lconnect (unidan sl120) so i cant comment on fan or rgb headers other than ""it has them"".","4 m.2 slots, only using 2.

the board is nice and thick- i'd bought a asrock 390 board for something and it was a flimsy pos.",this one is not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did it run hot during benchmarks or heavy load ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can somewhat agree with this.,aorus elite ax required a bios update before it would even post as wouldn't pick up the ram.,"admittedly, it was ddr5 ram released after the motherboard was released, so somewhat understandable.","have never had an issue with warranty with gigabyte, but i usually deal direct with the store i purchased it from.","they quite simply test it, and if it doesn't work, they give you a replacement.",great service.,i've only ever had one gigabyte board fail on me (have used a lot of gigabyte boards on personal and friends pc builds) and that was due to a psu failure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no donâ€™t regret because if they support it for the next 2 generations the prices would come down by a lot of both these ddr5 boards and the ram itself.,paying 400usd for ram stocks is just criminal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a lot of trouble believing that 14th and 15th generation will work on the same lga 1700 socket.,"it's going to be like what they've been doing since first gen. first gen was 1156, second and third were 1155, 4th and 5th were 1150, etc...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did order the msi mpg edge this morning so thatâ€™s that :) thanks for the inputs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my strix is fine with latest bios.,i was pretty pissed off with it beforehand and considered a return.,4x 8gb flarex 3200 @4000 and working great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€˜m running a 3090 and an m2 ssd in slot 1 (right below the cpu) and its running pci-e x16 4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah the mc here has about six for 114 dollars.,it's just a lot of returns or something else it seems.,however all the things i've seen about it on youtube says it's great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it runs quite cool in everything but cinebenchâ€¦.but thatâ€™s not board related and itâ€™s well known that alderlake is a furnace in that benchmark,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you.,i figured it would run x16 on a proper modern gpu.,i'm running a 7970 until the market calms down.,"stuck on x8, though it doesn't seem to affect performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"x8 3.0 (if i remember it right) is fast enough, even x8 4.0 is more than my card could ever make",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
laptops have 1 pcore 4 ecore celeron.,should be better than 8 ecore.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there won't be all e-cores because the entire point of a hybrid architecture is to have the best in class single thread performance and best in class multi thread performance in one package.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the point of market segmentation is not to sell someone something cheap to make, but to convince them to buy something more expensive.",celerons have few cores in order to convince people to buy i3 and i5 processors.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm just surprised it still legal to sell somebody a celeron processor as a processor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it may be cheaper to make cpus without efficient cores because the technology is new.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the i5 version of the samsung galaxy s book has the i5-l16g7 cpu that is 5 cores (1 big, 4 little).",i believe it is 10th generation based.,i have this laptop and it is great for web browsing or remote gaming from a playstation or capable desktop but even as a light work laptop i can see this not keeping up.,battery life is good but not amazing.,maybe 12th generation 1 + 4 could do better though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they reserve their hybrid architecture for the more high end skus.,there's no need to implement e cores alongside p cores in the lower models as they already perform quite well at their price point.,it's a pay to play game and at the end of the day they have to maintain some differentiation between different skus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> i know what you may be thinking.,"but, if 4 e-cores are the size of a p core, e-cores are designed for efficiency, and celerons/pentiums are designed for low power devices... why not make a processor thats all e-cores?","they do, although they are marketed as ""atom"" processors (rather than celeron or pentium), and the higher core-count skus are positioned for use in servers and other professional equipment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how many fucking times is this question going to be asked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it makes you wonder why intel didnt do 6+8, 4+8, 2+8, 1+8 on lower end desktop.",i definitely prefer 1+8 core than just silly 2 big cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in that case, would all small core xeon/high end models (not all, just a few) make sense?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[removed],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
low end chip are there for those who wants to buy.,"back to skylake there is 2c 4t i3s and 4c 4t i5 that is not worth it, are those illegal?",totl for lga 1151 at that time are 4c 8t.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it probably won't be until 14th gen meteor lake when e-cores are incorporated into desktop i3s,  non-k i5s and maybe even pentiums and celerons since by 2024 both windows 11 and intel's hybrid architecture will be more entrenched.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
true,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably 2+8 minimum to maintain symmetry.,they tried 1+4 in lakefield.,eg [l16g7](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/202777/intel-core-i5l16g7-processor-4m-cache-up-to-3-0ghz/specifications.html) low power 7 watt chip.,[impressive](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare/intel-i5-l16g7-vs-intel-i7-6500u/3809vs2607) for its tdp.,"&#x200b;

i think they are trying to max out the performance for that price bracket.","video watching, email checking, etc.",we probably havent quite yet jumped to full out any core count scaling.,lots more tasks will be single thread bound so having another big core is a plus.,someone on a pentium / celeron is probably more likely to be doing one task at a time.,and as u/creepingsomnambulist has added in.,their programs are getting more performance using less cores.,why?,probably because there is a resource overhead for using more threads.,have to have code that keeps all the concurrent tasks in sync and keeps them from tripping over each other.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel uses only the p cores for almost ever job.,only background stuff that use less cpu use the e cores.,"so, essentially, intel is giving the performance of 12 cores with only 8 p cores",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"meteor lake is tile based, coming after raptor lake.",you might've missed the point.,it's not because they are currently monolithic.,having a set of the widest cores that can boost as high as the silicon allows; enough of these to saturate the maximum fixed thread work loads is a win in that department.,then in addition packing in as many smaller cores that won't boost as high and use less power overall until we reach our power consumption and thermal ceiling wins at the multi thread work loads that scale across as many cores you have available.,because there is a thermal and power consumption ceiling and these smaller cores deliver more performance per watt at the lower power level they operate at than the big cores.,amd's working on their own version of this as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel has been selling xeons with atom processors (which the e cores are based on) for the last few years.,see for example the 16 core denverton xeons.,we will probably see even higher core counts next generation.,they work well in some niches.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there are many many applications where some professional needs low-core count server chips.,i believe high frequency trading is one example of many.,"not every professional workload can be or needs to be highly multithreaded; though those people may still require server- sized ram quantities, server- sized pcie lanes, ecc memory.","there are other bells and whistles that are often ""mission critical"" that come with server motherboards.",so it makes sense to continue to make lower-core xeons/epycs as many commercial applications just won't use more than 6 or so cores.,typically (at least with intel) you'll see that their lower core xeons are designed to clock significantly higher than their higher core chips.,this is again because for applications where only a few cores are required you get major benefits from higher frequencies.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean in use cases of selling them packaged as a laptop supposed to run windows 11 at atleast 720p to be usable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
should have been more clear as a processor of what it might be a calculator,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you'll see fewer dips and better lows but still limited to 1080/60fps or so in most games with the 390.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on the settings you use.,if you crank those games to their highest graphics settings you'll be bottlenecked by the 390 but at 1080p medium you'll notice gains.,"in an ideal world you upgrade both, but we all know the gpu situation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
going from 4 cores 4 threads to 6c 12t is significant for games that heavily load multiple threads.,the ipc increase is also nice.,"not sure about aoe 2 or d2r, but you can sort of see whether it's a cpu or gpu bottleneck by checking your gpu utilisation using hwinfo64 or similar with rtss.","if your gpu has plenty of headroom, e.g.","60% utilisation, then it's likely that your cpu is a bit of a bottleneck.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's a 10 year old 6 core processor, so basically any midrange processor would be a huge upgrade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i suppose that you had a cluster with 19 xeon computers, since a single computer with 19 xeons does not make any sense.","or better yet, why not give accurate details of what exactly you have now?",go look around great deals section of servethehome forums until someone posts anything broadwell-e or above.,"have seen already some 16+ core monsters for 100-200 u$d that would make for great budget pure compute systems, and i don't think you mind that there are already 6 years old or so if you're using something that should be around the 11-12 years mark.","ddr4 rdimm tends to be cheap, with the only thing that is usually expensive being a good dual cpu motherboard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably a 4s broadwell generation xeon platform would knock it out of the park.,if you want something modern cascade lake xeons will do the trick also.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for the web site!,"yes, this was the supercomputer that my university used.",i guess they needed more power to serve everybody.,but now i would like to have one only for myself so i can run the same experiments by my own without the university.,i am not an expert in computers as you can probably tell.,the goal is to simulate the binding of hundreds of thousands of small molecules to a target using a software called openeye.,"i don't have anything at this point, budget is not a problem but also i don't want to spend more than necessary.",i would rather wait 24h to finish a task with a 2k machine than doing it in 8h with a 10k machine.,"maybe it's too specific, but i really appreciate the resources you can tell me like the serve thehome page.",thank you!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you're not into computers, then i would consider building multiple nodes for a cluster yourself a bad idea.","besides, it seems that you're interesed in building such setup just because your university had it, but even if you had the money, do you really need multiple nodes and 100+ cores to achieve what you want?","check if what you want is possible in a standard modern consumer computer with reasonable performance before going to anything fancy like used enterprise hardware with stupidly high core counts from a few generations ago at bargain basement prices, as these may be cost effective but also harder to deal with.","if you know what software you previously used, just go to communities focused on those and take notes of how big their systems are before deciding on how big a single system has to be or if you want multiple to cluster together, since i believe that your hardware selection criteria will be wrong until you have a very good idea about that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what are your load/coolant temps?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just the aida64 stress test...can run it for however long you want.,i didn't use the washers since i felt my ihs contact was pretty good (trial and error).,not surprising your temps are better since you're using a 240 aio.,"i know my temps are pretty good for my setup since they're actually better than they were when i was using a z390i and 9900k with the same case, fans, aio, etc.",yeah i think i got lucky being able to run this at 6000 mhz.,thanks for checking it out!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sometimes this happens to me also...pretty sure its just a buffering issue.,try refreshing.,"it's just a secondary screen i use for aida64 to monitor temps, fan speeds, clocks, voltages, etc",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe re-seat your cooler?,also using thermal grizzly krynoaut extreme which iâ€™m finding has helped with temps.,iâ€™ve used it on a few builds and have reduced temps by a few degrees.,took my 3970x build all core 4.4 from mid 30s to low 30s at idle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'm hoping the lga 1700 upgrade kit will fix that issue.","funny enough, i also have a tube of kryonaut extreme out for delivery today, so i'll try it before the lga1700 upgrade kit comes in and after to see if there's any difference.","&#x200b;

you folks arenâ€™t benching in the same os though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is still quite low in comparison to other 12600k results.,it should get 11-12k multicore score.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm contemplating whether 12600k is a worthy upgrade over 5800x for typescript/webpack compiling.,i'm working with a very large web app and curious if [12% bench difference](https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/compare/7779017?baseline=12352120) would translate into similar reduction in my build times.,i suppose i'll only find out if i get the parts and benchmark.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i you are building software you should look for i7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my build doesn't scale with cores.,"i plan to pick up a 12400f/12600k/12700k and bench it, but so far here are results on ryzen and apple silicon:  


* pc - 5800x, 32gb, nvme, wsl2 - 240 sec_x000d_

* 16"" mbp, 10-core m1 pro, 16gb, nvme - 190-215 sec

that has an interesting correlation with geekbench single-core scores:

"it is down to the motherboard, the cpu, the interface and of course the nvme ssd you are using.","to take advantage of the speed that the 980 pro offers, you need all of the above to be pcie 4.0 ready.","as you said though, no game so far benefits from gen 4 nvme's, gen 3 is already more than enough.",even a sata ssd is fine for every game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

home nvme disks are not fast enough.,"the 980 is good, but it is home mid-range at best  

they are also fast enough, that you will not notice any improvement if you have faster disk, as data is compressed and you need an insane fast cpu to decrypt it faster.","if you want to see how much they can handle, copy a single large file.",this way it will be all about disks speed.,"but in real work random reads, anything over 100mb/s is already high-end.","this is so slow, that a good old sata channel is enough.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"you are getting the full nvme speeds on pcie 3.0. there is no such thing as ""full nvme speed"".",because pcie 5.0 can offer upto about 13gbps.,doesn't mean your 980 isn't running at it's full speed.,pcie 3.0 has a max bandwidth for 4 lanes at 3.5gbps which your are receiving.,and that is the max bandwidth for that drive.,a 980 pro has a pcie 4.0 nvme connection so it can give pcie 4.0 x4 speeds that is 7gbps.,pcie 5.0 is almost double that (though no consumer drives have been launched iirc).,"tbh if you're doing nothing but gaming, some light professional work, the upgrade is definitely not worth it.","it won't make a difference in transfer speeds either if your second drive from which you're transferring, doesn't support the same speed (most usb drives are less than half the speed of pcie 3.0)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i mean i don't always get true nvme speeds because i only have 1 however i plan to buy another one in the future so i can see how fast the transfers are.,also i plan on buying asus's nvme m.2 to pcie adapter which uses a pcie interface rather than the m.2 slots on the mobo.,side note: to get the system build info.,on the right when you go into a forum there should be a user flair preview.,in there you can add your build info,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i guess.,but non k skus are supposedly meant to run within spec aren't they?,"3600 already 12.5% above spec, so it's still decent gains.","and if you are going to spend more in ram to run at uber speeds than you are going to spend in the cpu itself, you might be budgeting wrong.","my 12700k ""only"" does 3900 in g1, no matter if i shove 1.5v in the sa.","so if you think you are gonna turn lower binned chips, with probably lesser memory controllers, into monsters just by them letting you tweak the sa voltage, you'd be in into a rude awakening.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i commented on der8auerâ€™s second video with my findings for blck oc.,it seems to be only a feature on ddr5 boards.,"the first bios revision has blck options, however changing the clock only affects the ram frequency and not the cpu - possible bug from factory?",any newer bios revision has the options removed for the non-k sku.,"it was my intention to do oc this way until i saved up for a k sku, but that didnâ€™t happen.","however, i got my first job starting monday so iâ€™ll be on a k sku fairly soon.",for future readers if they find themselves here for blck info: the asus strix z690-a d4 will not allow you to overclock this way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i would prioritize bandwidth over timings, just make sure the true latency is similar on higher frequencies",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not in this case.,3200mhz or 3600mhz actually runs at 1600mhz and 1800mhz respectively.,"its called ddr memory, with ddr meaning double data rate.","in this case they give you the ""doubled"" number.","3200 mt/s is the technically correct name since you get 2 transfers per clock cycle, but most people, especially more casual users just say 3200mhz because the marketing department of memory vendors decided that bigger number = better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is so disappointing for memory overclockers but 3600 cl14 with tuned secondaries is still solid as hell and should yield most of the performance out of b die.,itâ€™s not a terrible situation.,terrible would be 3200 cl16 limit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"interesting, thanks.","let's say i wanted to bring a 3600mhz ram with 16 cl to 4000 mhz with gear 2, would the increase in latency be generally noticeable?","(videogames aside)

i never seen alder lake hit below 40ns.,much less with a 3600kit.,4000-4200 on g1 which is the maximum 12th gen achieves in g1 hover 43-47 ns depending on the timings.,"this on aida, i don't know if you mean another test.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's not negligible unless you're running 5800 plus ddr5 in the in the high 50s low 60s for latency.,"gaming at high competitive frame rates most often benifits from bandwidth and latency

"i think that this is reason enough to just return the machine as faulty: ""*cinebench crashes for me, but intel extreme tuning shows thermal throttling within a second of starting a stress test and for the remainder (5 min).","*""

if you do not want to do that then start with the usual suspects and test cinebench between each of these steps and check if thermal  throttling happens:

* reset bios to optimized defaults
* check your aio pump speed  that it ramps up properly.",i would just put it at 100% for testing to see if that makes any difference.,* check performance with an air cooler if you have one (you said that you have always used those before).,you do not even need to have mounting for it.,just put it on cpu and apply proper pressure by hand while you test run it.,"if it is a lot better than the aio, then either the aio is faulty or your settings for it are bad (that very modest coolant temp rise when the cpu is thermal throttling sounds very suspect to me).","you may eventually end up undervolting the cpu, but then you would be changing system settings to accommodate for faulty system.","cpu needs to work without undervolting, that should just be something that you do to make it work better.",you should not buy a multithousand dollar/eur machine and settle for less than perfect working condition.,that just sets a terrible precedent for companies to follow.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you check if the aio pump is working/ plugged in?,"given its a prebuilt, quality tends to suffer from what i've heard, and simple errors like it not even being plugged in could very well happen.","try to listen for some pump noise and make sure the pump is plugged into the board properly

do you have enhanced turbo enabled in advanced cpu configuration in your bios ?,that could lead to much higher temps stock.,also do you have msi dragon centre installed.,make sure game boost is set to off and off in your bios as well.,its recommended to not use msi dragon centre at all unless you need to set rgb.,then uninstall it all together.,lastly once you work out everything is working properly its a good idea to apply a undervolt if your not overclocking.,a quickway to do so on msi boards is to set cpu lite load to a lower number for example from mode 9 to mode 4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

something that you may consider giving a try is using the power level throttles to regulate this problem.,i had similar issues with mine at setup though i'm just using an air cooler.,"i set pl1 to 135 watts and pl2 to 190 watts; this cost me a small amount of its turbo boosted performance, but everything else works like a champ and is very fast for all workloads that i use.","my hunch, with the cooler you have, you should be able to adjust those two settings a bit higher and still avoid thermal throttling and error conditions.",i think they just set it too high on everything and didn't bother to test to see if it was stable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hi old thread but i think my advices will be relevant here if you haven't fixed your problem yet.,my pc is a custom built from a shop i couldn't choose the component so i was pretty mad to see it arrived with a 240mm aio pump as everywhere on the internet recommend 360mm.,"i started with disabling the intel turbo boost, having the core clock speed at base clock speed of 3.2 but i wasnt getting anywhere near my needs.",so i looked around and found an overclocking i9 12900k on youtube.,guy is pretty smart and i tried juggling with the settings a bit.,i installed intel xtu (xtreme tunning utility) which showed me by doing a test that the cpu in fact thermal throttleing alot at that gave me a score of 7500 which was very bad for the i9.,there's a button in the intel xtu to ez oc your i9 but that gave me even worst temps.,it had configured all clocks of the p cores at 51 and all clocks of the e cores to 40. that was insane.,i have an asrock mobo and settings arent well explained.,msi mobo are good tho.,what i did is i downclocked the oc to all p cores to 49 and all e cores to 37. that didn't help on temp.,"what helped is as follow :

in the bios

\-disable intel thermal velocity boost voltage optimizations

\-disable bclk aware adaptive voltage

in voltage :

\-cpu core/cache voltage : static : 1.25v

in the fivr configuration :

\-core voltage mode : static (set at 1.25v)

\-core voltage offset : auto (keep it at auto)

\-offset prefix : negative ( - )

thing is (may not be the same as for your mobo) my asrock boost the voltage cause cpu is tagged to be in turbo mode, so i put a negative offset to counter the turbo mode voltage boost

&#x200b;

happy ending is :

now my cpu is at 50 on idle (i don't really care) but never thermal throttles and i can play games without it ever hitting 80 c

i did another intel xtu test after that and my score went up to 9200 (from 7500 with more oc) because it never thermal throttled.",i'd also like to point out that in wow i struggled to get 100fps in stormwind before the changes and now i am getting a whopping 300 fps.,"having underclocked the i9 12900k turbo boost actually double my performance so i hope this helps you because i, too, once called for an rma before testing with the voltages.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

vccsa voltage is locked to ~0.9v on 12th gen non k skuâ€™s.,0.9v should get you to about 3600 g1.,your best bet is to either run 3600 g1 with tighter timings or run higher frequency g2.,edit: b-die at 3600 might even be stretching it for 0.9vâ€¦ all i can say is good luckâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the only way i can get my 4000cl16 kit to pass stress tests is to set sa voltage to 1.25v.,stock will not even post.,i think it's fairly common that stock sa voltage will not let you run that kind of frequency in gear 1 with alder lake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is normal for alder lake to hit a wall at 3800 on default.,just turn vccsa up around 1.2 or more and see if it works.,maybe vccio too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as said by others really want 1.25-1.35v vccsa for that memory speed on gear1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
memory speeds are probably too high for your 12100f.,"intel spec is 3200mhz for ddr4, and you'll typically hit a wall at 3600mhz.",performance difference between 3600 to 4000 is very low anyways though on intel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice upgrade from socket 7 btw ;-),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i couldn't get my ram to post at 4400 or 4000. i ended up just leaving it at 3600.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably the cpuâ€™s memory controller vs the ram and the rams quality.,"or it could be the bios of the board needs an update to support the ram if the cpuâ€™s memory controller can handle it, to even how they board was made and stripped down.",iâ€™m leaning towards the board choice honestly with maybe a combination of the bios.,4000mhz sticks normally need 1.4-1.45v to run vs the standard 1.3-1.35v of lower speed kits.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

itâ€™s actually a big difference but that is on a 12900k/kf itâ€™s the difference between 900 points on the cpu score in 3dmark and in some games a minimum fps of 50 vs a minimum 70-80 in say cyberpunk 2077. that is what i am seeing between two kits 3600 vs 4000 that i have.,it could be the opâ€™s board from everything iâ€™m seeing posted everywhere and on overclock.net,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ahahah thanks!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ve ran these sticks at 4000 with 1.45v before on my previous system.,"it might have been 1.5, but iâ€™m fairly confident it was 1.45 (which is the stock voltage i believe)
iâ€™m a bit disappointed that i canâ€™t run it at 4000.

i wonder if a 12400f would fair any better (itâ€™s probably down to luck iâ€™m guessing) and iâ€™m also trying to find comparisons between different ram speeds and timings on these cpus",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this has nothing to do with your b-die.,it is intel locking parts of the cpu that prevents it from taking advantage of your good ram.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"my board is an asrock z690m-itx and i cant even set vccsa in biosâ€¦ a newer, worse, bios has the option but it doesnâ€™t actually take effect.",can you use intel xtu to report on the vccsa?,just to check itâ€™s actually setting properly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the big one on z690 ddr4 boards is who made it and the boards bios for ram compatibility.,msi for ram is best all around.,asus is great but depending on the kit if itâ€™s not a real premium set you may need a custom bios from shamino on overclock.net.,"gigabyte
asrock
the list continues with other boards in board quality and bios quality to compatibility.","like on msi i would not get anything below the edge, asus itâ€™s top model and the really nice gigabyte that is undercutting the other two board makers on their premium â€œas it can get :/â€œ z690 ddr4 boards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

a question, iâ€™ve pushed the ram timings as far as i could on my ryzen system with the help of some calculator software.","could the same timings be used on this system, or itâ€™s not the same thing?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

cinebench can be very susceptible to other programs running in the background taking up resources.,"if you go into the details page on task manager and find cinebench.exe and bump it's priority to high or above normal, you'll see a noticeable bump in score.",a lot of reviewers that publish their cinebench scores usually have very lean os installs with not much going on to take up resources which is why you'll usually see slightly better scores from them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seems like a normal enough score to me.,"there are many factors that can affect it such as power limits, background tasks, tvb and thermal headroom.","best not to stress too much about it as you'd never notice the difference between 22,800 and 21,700 in the real world.",it might also be a good idea to set your power plan back to balanced.,"it massively clocks down your cpu when it's not under load which means lower voltages, less power consumption etc.",plus you should see little or no difference in cinebench.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

so tech notice was right!,the cpu **does** use more power when it gets hot so having a good cooler keeps it cooler which keeps it from using more power which keeps it cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it's not a big issue since 80c+ loaded means tvb vo is only reducing voltages by 30mv at most, meaning a ~5% increase in package power and temperature at typical 12700/12900k all-core turbo voltages.",it will make the cpu less efficient in medium loads and desktop idle but few people watch for that.,i figured i might as well let people know since there are posters running around telling everyone with a temperature question that they need to mod their ilm.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
auto will act as disabled if you touch the oc settings such as multipliers.,i don't remember if xmp i/ii will do it as well but there's little reason to disable tvb vo in normal daily oc settings so my advice is to always force it enabled under the tvb settings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you have to buy a cable sold for your specific model of psu.,"there is no standardization on modular cable output pinout on the psu side, even within the same brand, as they source from different oems.",using a modular cable not intended for your psu can fry whatever you connect it to if the pin out is different and suddenly youâ€™re pumping voltage into the wrong place.,"with that said, you shouldnâ€™t need it.","if you have the correct cable there is no reason not to hook it up, but your symptoms are pretty much what a psu would do if it detected a dead short, and if that cable is generic and not guaranteed compatible for your model of psu, then youâ€™re lucky something didnâ€™t fry.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you donâ€™t need the 2nd cable unless you plan on extreme over clocking which iâ€™m assuming youâ€™re not gonna do.,one eps supplies more than enough voltage for your cpu even with an overclock.,if youâ€™re gonna start ln2 over clocking then youâ€™d maybe need the other one.,tldr; no you wonâ€™t mess it up as one cable is fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
336w according to [this](http://www.playtool.com/pages/psuconnectors/connectors.html#eps8).,"7 amps * 4 lines (8 pin) * 12v=336w

again consider yourself lucky that you didn't break anything.,do not let that cable anywhere near your pc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
on my board one supplies nearly 400w.,i have a 12700kf and run only one cable and i have it over clocked.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's a really bad sign that the pc doesn't boot with the second cable.,it could mean that the second cable that you got uses a different pinout and your 12 volt and ground got shorted.,consider yourself lucky that you didn't break anything.,do not let that second cable anywhere near your pc.,"as for how much power your one cable can handle, that is determined by the pins on the motherboard and the wire gauge of the cable.",you should see some small writing on the individual wires and at one point it should say 18 awg.,"as long as the wires are 18 awg or thicker, it will be the pins that are the limiting factor.","as for the pins, i have to assume that if your motherboard has two eps connectors, it will be using the solid pins, which are the high current variety which go up to 13 amps.",even the lower end stamped pins are rated at 9 amps.,the eps connector uses 4 12v pins and 4 ground pins.,the capacity is additive.,9 * 4 amps = 36 amps.,12 volts * 36 amps equals 432 w. your cpu would overheat way before you would be at any risk of exceeding the power limit of the eps connector.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for 1 8pin eps.,"some designs states 150w
some 225w.",some 300w.,don't know which is right.,that cpu may pull around 240w under load.,its safe to use 2   8pin in such setup.,why stress those connectors to limits.,am no expert in oc but if we don't know about exact numbers about that psu model then it's better to play safe and buy new gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

my first board (which died after 1.5 years 2 days ago) had the intel i225-v issue where it worked for the first couple months and then just stopped.",couldn't find a solution so i bought a third party nic for $20 and haven't had any issues since.,"...except board died this weekend with vga white light of death (q-led stuck on vga, wouldn't boot) so i replaced the board with a new (same board model) asus x570 pro and everything is working again.",thought i might try the intel adapter again but don't feel like screwing with a working pc right now - was hoping the v225 was fixed somehow but doesn't seem that way from the comments.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this chip is garbage.,won't connect to my at&t router unless i put an ethernet switch between them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"had half the connection speed on my ""intel(r) ethernet controller (2) i225-v""

i was able to fix it with the tcp optimizer from speedguides",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i fixed the problem by bridging the cmos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had an issue with this when i did the intel net 1.0.2.22 driver update that was optional months ago.,"it would literally make it so when i tried to live stream, everything immediately tanked.",i rolled back the driver and it was back to normal.,forgot all about it.,now as of 2 days ago it was an auto update that happened without my knowledge.,took me a whole day of dealing with my isp and other garbage before remembering that issue and checking.,lo and behold.,i had the 1.0.2.22 driver again.,idk what it is but that driver is awful.,iâ€™m not on my pc at the moment but i think i rolled back to 1.0.1.6 or something along those lines.,works fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have the z590 aorus pro ax and i have the same issue.,"often happening after being inside the bios getting the ""code 10 cannot start"".",only way to fix it seem to unplug the power cable and reset cmos.,"i have the latest drivers from gigabytes website, the 1.0.1.4 drivers.",issue is not fixed despite being the v3 of the i255-v nic.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you disabled fast boot?,"i had a similar issue until i disabled that, after a full shutdown/boot i would have no internet.","a simple (but annoying) restart would bring me back to working order, but it obviously got old fast.","disabling fast boot was the answer for me, and with an ssd you don't need fast boot anyway.","i've never had the code 10 issue, but maybe this will help that too?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i know i am late to the party but my ethernet can work fine for hours and then will randomly drop and then come back up.,i wonder if this is the issue i am having as my pc is connected to a pretty old router itself.,thanks for the info.,i might try throwing that switch in the middle as it seems easiest and cheapest.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i tried this and bought a netgear 5 port unmanaged switch and the problem still persists.,"ethernet ""no internet"".",my connection is working on everything else.,gone through every driver.,and its an itx board so i cant use buy a new nic for my mobo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wow.,issues still ongoing with this nic.,went through several amd boards last fall with the i225v.,lots of instability regardless of driver.,ultimately returned 'em and got something with the rtl8125.,"solid, no issues.",what's really surprising is the inconsistency with the i225v.,"some have no issues at all, for others  (like me), it literally took the whole system down.","these days anything i build i make sure it either has an i211, i219, or rtl8125 for 2.5 gbps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my issue was an ""optimizer"" pre-installed by asus.","once i nuked that piece of software and disabled asus' stupid auto-reinstall on boot, my steam downloads when from 0.1mbps to 45+... yeah, it was that bad",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably gonna go with startech usb31000sptb,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
update that bios to f5.,the original versions aren't coded right for non-k cpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"an air cooler isn't really recommended for a 12900k because it does get hot, typically people pair it with a 240-360 aio or loop.","but there are things you can do to manage the heat before you look to replace the cooler, turn off any motherboard multicore enhancement/boost feature, undervolt, and if needed, lower pl2.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
*patiently waits for the bent cpu crowd to file in*,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you really need a 280mm radiator minimum for a 12900k.,yes you can get away with a noctua nh-d-15 but don't expect much overclocking headroom.,i would recommend a arctic freezer ii 360+ conductonaut.,liquid metal is really good on alderlake because of the soldered ihs (you don't need to delid.,infact it's dangerous on alder because you are having to break solder!).,if your case can fit it a 420mm arctic freezer is like $120 and comes with the bracket.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"get a aio 360 they do run hot...sad to say, and get some good case vents going.",is your case one of them with fuck all air flow?,it all helps..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
get an ek elite 360 d-rgb if on a boarder other than asus get the ekwb 1700 aio upgrade kit.,get a tube of ic diamond 24. do the x application of ic diamond 24 on the cpu.,put tiny 1/4th of a pea drops between all four < on the tim application.,put on the eliteâ€™s aio pump block press firmly but not to hard on the center of the aio.,"now the screw/bolts

iâ€™ll give the noctua a shot.,thank you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the u12a is another good option.,itâ€™s on par with the d15 temp wise.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was gonna get the aio you mention off of amazon but i see a lot of people are experiencing pump failures.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
status update: the noctua seems to do well so far.,cpu barely gets over 80 with it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you have to look at what they purchased all the ek aio reviews are lumped up between all the aioâ€™s.,i have been using mine since last year for about year on my 10900kf and now itâ€™s on my 12900kf.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hmm.,iâ€™ll check again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i really do not see the pump going out on the elite it is the same pump that is in the ek black nickel classic 360 d-rgb water cooling kit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ah.,i was looking at the 360mm basic.,iâ€™ll look at that one and see.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah the basics and the ones with the almost transparent white pvc plastic rgb pump covers have lower quality pumps they are the same tier as anything asetek or coolit makes and anyone who leases those designs.,the ek elite 360 and the 280 are in a league of their own.,i still would not go below a the elite 360 on a 10th-12th gen i9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i may go elite then.,thanks for the help.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just be sure to follow what i wrote above on tim choice, the ek 1700 aio upgrade kit if you donâ€™t have an asus z690, tim application, installation.",spent the past two days applying tim to see if i could get better results than the x method with the 4 small balls was the best.,you do not want to try another tim method not like the temps then reapply it.,the lids and a lot of the motherboard cpu mounting kits suck.,you do it once you probably wonâ€™t have to do the washer mod to your board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"my specs are really similar to yours, i'm running at 720p on the gpd win 3 and games that never used to stutter have started across the board (including when i emulate) so i am going to hazard to guess it could well be a driver issue.","strange thing is though, the driver released in dec and it's only recently started and it's annoying as hell.",even when i turn the graphical seeing right the way down to its in lowest possible configuration and 30fps it's still happening.,"whilst not a solution, im kind of glad it's not just me and hopefully it's just a rogue update or driver issue which hopefully gets sussed / patched soon!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

of course even at 5 ghz, the performance would still be questionable, power efficiency is thrown out the window (a quad-core stock i5-7400 with an intel stock cooler and a cheap board matches an almost 5 ghz i3-7350k in many gaming benchmarks while using far less power), and the motherboard + ddr5 isn't going to be cheap either.","if a 2c/4t i3-7350k running at almost 5 ghz was sent through the microstuttering woodchipper by battlefield 5 (rip for my friend who trusted a salesperson to buy that cpu), i doubt the celeron would be much of an improvement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

like i said office pcs seem like the most obvious scenario.,thin clients especially come to mind as you don't need much processing power for that so it being a dual core doesn't really hurt it.,"it could also be a good solution for small businesses which need a simple pc for email, logging data, managing orders etc though from what i've seen these days laptops are more common for that use case.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why not a 12400,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you brazilian?,"if you are, there are a few subs that should help you make your own build, while taking brazilian prices into account:

"op is likely brazilian, and lga1700 boards are still obscenely expensive and incredibly hard to find in brazil.",the only boards i can find are z690's and they are all either sold out or costing 500+ usd.,12th gen is a no go.,"personally, between these two, i'd pick whichever is the cheapest.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

11400 for sure !,!!,check out gamers nexus review!!,steve made an incredible/outstanding job out there and summed up everything you need to know!!,!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i just built two 11400 machines.,if you get a motherboard that has good power delivery and add a good cooler it will run 4.2 ghz all day.,both of these builds used the rog strix b560-a gaming wi-fi board.,one has an artic cooler 13 co and the other has a hyper 212 black cooler.,on the intel extreme tuning utility stress test cpu with avx-512 both machines ran 4.20 on all six cores.,"max package tdp was 122 watts, max core tdp was 105 watts.",package temp peaked at 171f.,"this was with no thermal, power, current or vr throttling.",this with air cooling.,i've built machines since newegg was started.,these are the most stable machines i have ever seen.,including post it only takes 6 seconds from on switch to the log in screen.,the 11400 has 4th gen nvme capability.,the 10600k only has 3rd generation nvme capability.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

11400,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 11400 is about 20% faster.,i'd get it instead of the 10600.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"neither, get an apu- ryzen 3/4/5600g (150-220 eur)... 
motherboard- b550 (less than 100eur, pcie4), or b450/a320 (around 50 eur, pcie3) 
ram- at least 16gb 3000mhz cl15 / 3200mhz cl16 (around 50eur), or same speed 2x16gb kit (110 eur)
if you don't have a gpu upfront, that's the best solution to do some work... until you find/get a gpu for a fair price.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 10600k is the better pick.,you donâ€™t need the newest processor out right now.,itâ€™s almost 2 years old and still a great processor.,spend the extra $20.,you wonâ€™t be disappointed you did.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 10600. looks like it does 6 cores/12 threads at a higher clock speed.,clock speed is important for graphic design and video editing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

10600 - uhd 630 
11500 - uhd 750 

if you need intel only then try for 11500.

12400 is much better than 10600k and better than 11600k, better in blender as well.","with either of them you have an upgrade path to a 13700, double the rendering power while keeping your old mb and ram.",i would go with 12100. if business picks up you can just throw in a 13700 for a big upgrade in render times.,"but if the price is too high 10600 or 3700x, depending on price in your region.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
el 11400 is better due to the higher ram frequency and pcie gen 4. in the real world 10600k is better but for your workloads the ram and pcie will be more useful.,sincerely the 12400 is not worth in this case.,not that much gain for the price and definitely not worth the ram loss.,"what you chose is already enough for what you  want to do, don't pay overprices for almost nothing.","the 12400 is definitely better (and 12600k way more) but it's like buying a i9 for gaming, yes it's better but it's too pricey for the performance gain.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you really need fast answers, pass mark is better than nothing but in general getting real world benchmarks from youtube channels like gamers nexus and hardware unboxed, or news sites like pc gamer and techpowerup are going to be a lot more useful and oftentimes you can see what cpus will be the best for whatever application you plan on using depending on the source",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"because they have huge biases for intel, they completely change the weighting of their ranking to make them favor team blue, the text about the products are also comedy gold, honestly everything is better than userbenchmark",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
their interface looks nice and all but their benchmark methodology is extremely suspect and their written reviews are biased.,"it's no secret that userbenchmark are huge intel shills, and they're banned virtually everywhere (including on this sub).",you shouldn't use such resources to weigh your purchase options.,"i would recommend pooling information from many places, check if they're credible, look at the benchmark numbers and decide for yourself.","you can't go wrong with either 10600k or 11400f, but i would go with the former for that extra performance, since lga1200 is discontinued anyway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
99% of people run their machines with only 2 ram sticks anyway.,"the last time i had 4 was in 2012, because i recycled some from a machine that died...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what ddr4 motherboards are best in therms of low power and efficiency for this sort of cpu's??",?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

most itx boards should be pretty efficient.,haven't seen testing but i bet they're pretty similar.,since memory is constantly draining power you'll want to avoid dimms that require elevated voltage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"well a decent 240hz monitor is no more than $400 and you can get them even less than that, but you did just spend a minimum $1500 on your gpu and cpu.","i guess if you hold off, i read that monitor prices may be coming down this summer for some reason.",look into it.,i donâ€™t remember the exact reason as i just skimmed it cuz a good monitor was the first thing i bought ðÿ˜‚.,build looks amazing tho man!,!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
beyond your means?,dude you running 3080 and gimping on monitor lol.. that logic..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you have spent a lot of money for new gpu, cpu+mobo and you are getting \~1/3 what it can deliver due to display bottleneck.","i don't know what you had before, but probably it would be better go for a new monitor first and cpu+mobo after.",on a good side your pc should be silent af :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you couldâ€™ve bought a 3060 and had the same effective performance at 1080p 60fps.,the display is the window into your hardware and is just as important as a decent gpu.,you can get 1440p 240hz monitors cheap now and it would let your hardware perform.,if you werenâ€™t spending beyond means ie 1080p 60fps the aforementioned 3060 wouldâ€™ve been a better purchase.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have no idea how your comment is in anyway controversial enough to be downvoted this much.,â€œiâ€™m holding off atm and not gonna spend beyond means after spending well over 1kâ€ *getâ€™s downvoted into oblivion*,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yet you overpaid for rgb ram (unless somehow it was cheaper than the non rgb version which is unlikely),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because your pc is a waste of money with that monitor?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s ignorance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you better be.,"this phrase, paired with a pc like yours is a literal meme in this community.",i would only use it seriously when i'm on a super tight budget and really trying to make things work with what i got available.,"some people learn it the ""hard"" way.","welcome to the community, you've built yourself an amazing rig!",:),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 no people hate the fact that your pc is wasted on it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
understandable.,cable management is hell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i imagine that was the case.,i just love it when people show off their pc and folks get upset because it has parts they cannot get atm.,either way build is nice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no problem.,if you ever wanna sellâ€¦ ðÿ˜†,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i imagine the 1080ti was still functioning too?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

absolutely not.,"all i'm saying is that you could get a lot more out of your pc with a 1440p 144hz monitor, for example.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for a while it probably will be.,"you will over time, loose water through the tubes and get air in the system.",it takes time.,you'll first notice it when you turn on the system after a while.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"why the fuck would you buy a 12700k and 3080, only to pair it with a 1080p 60hz monitor?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
haha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you think the 3080 cam handle 144hz?,because even at 60hz i can notice the screen tearing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3090?,or 3090ti when thatâ€™s a thingâ€¦ or am i missing smth and the 3080ti is better than a 3090,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s my next plan.,looking to buy an ultrawide monitor.,thanks man,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
perhaps he was only able to grab 3080 at msrp and will get a better monitor later?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"will do man, thanks for the heads up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
240hz is a bit overkill though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this guy gets it.,i donâ€™t have any magical printer that can print out money.,let me make some til i can afford a better monitor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ve already spend the money tho.,wait til i make sum before upgrading my monitor lol.,last i check they never get scalped,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks man!,appreciate it!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nothing is going to waste bruv, i can game smoothly so far",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think the 1080 ti can be a bottleneck when paired with the i7 12700k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thereâ€™s a cutout for cable routing.,so i just route it through the cutout.,i didnâ€™t do any modifications to my case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thatâ€™s my next plan man, gonna save up to buy an ultrawide.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
planning to buy a new casing so i can fit the aio on top.,might go for the phanteks p500a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my guess your using the gn source.,that good old steve did.,that  he is not a water dynamic engineer or any other engineer.,oh btw steve out source the script to a real one and said real one really dumb it down to steve.,steve made many mistakes.,made a second video no one watch.btw is the same dude that could not figure out how to build a basic nas and had wendell do it for him.oh not know what half the test equipment is or what it is used for...(bps custom video),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your monitor is likely not gysnc or freesync capable.,"once you move up to a good 1440p 144hz monitor that has gysnc/freesync capable, you will not have screen tearing anymore even without vsync.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i know for a fact that it can.,"i use a 1440 144hz monitor with a build that is extremely similar to yours, and i can run everything at 100+ fps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
honestly go 165hz or 240hz with that setup.,ignore any issues you currently have with a 60hz monitor- they literally don't matter if you are upgrading.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, tearing isn't necessarily an fps issue.",enable vsync.,get a gsync compatible monitor.,"my 1080ti plays everything at ultra still at 1440p, most games well over 100fps.",the 3080 will destroy that.,it cracks me up when people talk about the 3080 being great for 1440p.,"1440p is not that hard to drive, and it's nothing for a 3 series card.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3090 is a workstation card, not a gaming card.","marketing was a scam to get the gaming audience involved, and it worked; they sold like hotcakes.",itâ€™s essentially the 3080 with 3 times the memory bus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i traded a 3070 ti for the 3080,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so is the pc so might as well go all out lmao,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hz dictate frame rate and 1080p dictate clarity so yeah it kinda is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i guess our point is that you couldâ€™ve purchased an i3 with an rtx 3060 and still would be more than enough for a 1080p 60hz monitor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"its really not, 1080ti is like 3060 without rtx",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"gn and linus, of course.","i'm also following the manufacturer's recommendations (arctic, specifically) and working with pumps and radiators from personal and job experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the info!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so it still does out perform it... even of its just slightly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lolâ€¦.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nah bro a 3060 is not overkill.,you can always see the difference by turning up quality settings or running new games.,"240hz though, marginal return on investment compared to 120/144hz",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and your point is?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i mean if you want to pay nearly $1000 more for 10-12 more fps (which is little enough to be considered a factor of the silicon lottery) thatâ€™s your prerogative, but the statement still stands that the card is really only *that* much better in gaming.","the only place youâ€™d see a true gain in performance would be in high-mem applications such as rendering suites, cad software, etc.",8k gaming is fucking stupid so donâ€™t even bring that up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as iâ€™m talking to you, this is starting to make more and more sense",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fine then will upgrade my monitor next sigh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean gamer.,if it has gaming in to.,they will buy it.,i mean every gaming monitor that 4k.,is total crap due to it does not fit 4k standard and hdr... yeah your not getting real hdr and more then 60hz.,also gamers are total to cheap to buy a proper hdr monitor.,5k used and 15k new.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tell your friend to ask this internally.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your friend should ping the hiring manager directly and ask him.,if there is a hiring coordinator then talk to the hiring coordinator,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it may be that the referral does not result in the candidate getting an email.,"they should check workday to see if it lists the referral, and if so then everything should be fine.",it's up to the hiring manager if they want to reach out to referred candidates.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thank you, will referring in the portal won't work ?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it does, but it's always good to follow it up closely with the hiring manager.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is your aio's pump running?,it's a possibility that it isn't and that is causing the overheating issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"here are my parts:

cpu: i9-129000k
gpu: evga 3080
mobo: asus z690-e
ram: trident z ddr5 6000 
case: lian li uni evo 
case fans: x9 lian li uni sl 120
aio cooler: nzxt kraken z73
m.2: samsung 980 pro
hhd: seagate barracuda 4tb
psu: corsair 1000w psu

note: could it be possible that i have pretty poor thermal paste application / poor spread causing this issue?",if the cpu is not bent is there anything i can do to not have to resort to rma?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"something wrong with your cooler man, not the chip.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i doubt your cpu is bent.,"ensure you've peeled off the clear film from the aio cooler, for applying the thermal paste the x method seems to work quite well.","make sure your aio is plugged in and running, you should be able to feel the pump running/vibrating.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
check the bios in ez mode fan speeds (press f7).,if the aio pump reports as 0 rpm then the pump is busted which then is the reason for your temps.,edit: added the bios line to clarify.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
update when its ok ktnx :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would bet that the pump on you aio is dead.,the bent cpu issue would not be sufficient to cause your cpu to overheat when not under load.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you using lga 1200 or 1700 mounting kit?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what voltage is your cpu using?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
try and just put the aio on the cpu and hold it with your hand (or get someone else to help you) to apply the pressure instead of using the mounting kit.,the aio bracket itself may be defective and not make contact.,"also double check for the cpu temps in other software too (like afterburner), it may be a software reading issue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you've tried most of the good suggestions so far, i would check if the aio is faulty

it can show rpm readings but still be kaput, so if you have another cooler to test, i would try that

i have a spare noctua l9a i keep around just in case one of my aios fail, as i've had an old bequiet aio fail on me a few years back",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah the cpu looks fine (better than my 12900kf, actually), i agree with the others that it sounds like something is wrong with you aio or you are somehow not getting any contact between the cooler and the cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"don't know much about 12th gen intel voltage and temp as much as 10th gen, but 90-100c at 1v is definitely not good.","i would either rma the cpu, or check that your cooler is working.","if you have a spare cooler that would work, try that and it could narrow down if its actually your pump or the cpu.",depending on your cooler try using the manufacturer software as well to see if it works.,for example i use cam for my nzxt kraken to change pump speed and show rpm.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is crazy.,i haven't seen such idle temperatures even with a non-working stock intel cpu cooler attached.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
update: took the aio pump header and inserted in the cpu_fan slot instead.,reapplied thermal paste in x shape and ensured aio pump is running.,iâ€™ll include new pictures with what the bios reads.,"it did not jump up to 90 degrees celsius however it started and 20c, climbed up to 40-50c during bios and eventually shut down.","https://imgur.com/gallery/u0kmdqy


would this determine it being the aio or cpu?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"full information: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezauy4as4li  
in short: every cpu is flat when you buy it, it bends under pressure of the securing mechanism.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you get the lga 1700 adapter for the aio,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do the washer mod on the cpu mounting bracket on your board.,"as for your aio get yourself an ek elite 360 d-rgb, and a tube of ic diamond 24 thermal compound.","trust me

do the x application on the cpu of the ic diamond 24, between each < of the x right in the middle put a small ball dot of thermal compound.","when installing the ek elite on the cpu when you place it on top of the cpu press it gently down in the center, then put your springs/tighting bolts on, put them on like you would do with a regular cpu cooler going in an x motion, hand tighten them from the side with your finger until you get resistance and cannot tighten them without effort.",then you get your screw driver and do the same rotation do two quarter turns with the screw driver twice on each one.,after that do it one more.,"your aio will be tight enough, the ic diamond 24 will be spread properly.",then enjoy your tmeps.,the ek elite 360 d-rgb is the only aio/cooler besides going with a good water kit that can really keep this cpu cool.,"https://www.modsrigs.com/detail.aspx?buildid=42630

just use more paste so you fill the gap cause by the concave shape,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what's the ruler for?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i believe so, on bios it reads aio pump = full speed.",any specific screenshot i can grab to verify?,i believe it is on however.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is that the new is your refrigerator running joke?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah.... i think so too.,26.6 watts and the chip is hitting 100c ?,!!??!,i would lather on the thermal paste!,"j/k....

but i would seriously lather on the thermal paste to your ihs die.",spread it out like you are applying mortar on your bricks.,then place the aio temporarily on the ihs to get an imprint of where the paste lands.,now do the exact same thing on the aio cooler.,lather the thermal paste on that like applying mortar to brick.,this ensures good paste contact.,now lightly place the aio cold plate onto your ihs.,"do not apply any pressures on this as when you remove your external pressure, the aio cold plate may lift up slightly.",so instead lightly place it down and then twist the aio a bit from side to side to fill in the gaps.,now the trickiest part.,you want to screw down each screw as evenly as you can.,pretend that you are some automotive assembly line worker and you have a tool that can simultaneously screw down all 4 screws at the same time.,yeah... haha you want that kind of precision when remounting the cpu.,"=p

but just do so as evenly as you can.",you can't go wrong applying paste and remounting!!!,but it definitely sounds like a paste/mount maybe faulty aio pump/fan issue.,its definitely something wrong with your cooling system.,"edit:

https://youtu.be/lhobrvxyqeg?t=242",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cpuâ€™s are not flat.,spending all this money not knowing what you spend it on.,probably rookie mistake of not removing the plastic film from the aio.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"when i personally put thermal paste on i like to spread it all over the whole cpu with my finger, a nice thin  ish layer, then i'll put a tad bit thicker in the middle since i know it'll all spread out.","you may just have a faulty cpu too in that its not properly transferring heat, or the internal temp probes faulty.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"uhhh 12th gen intel takes z690, not z590, so maybe that?",but i also assume that you just have a typo because youâ€™re using ddr5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"will double check that in the morning, thank you!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"also, iâ€™ve tried to get it to run a few times now with remounting the aio 5-6 times.",could there be a possibility that the film has melted on the cpu?,i believe i removed the film but i want to consider all possibilities.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this.,the full speed you're talking about op is just the setting.,actually reading will be in qfan.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hopefully i get to update with good news ðÿ¥²,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just received the lga 1700 bracket and installed it.,i think i can attribute poor application of the thermal paste / contact of the aio.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
.870 v,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i guess my next question is what exactly would good contact look like?,"when installing the aio, i tried to firmly press the cooler down and install the screws evenly to prevent unevenness.",the next issue i would like to address is could my issue be that i am applying the thermal paste unevenly?,"referring to the link, my paste looked similar to the image in the link.",https://www.igorslab.de/en/bad-cooling-at-alder-lake-problems-at-socket-lga-1700-on-the-lane-among-all-remedies/2/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m disappointed not sure what to do weâ€™ve determined itâ€™s either the cpu or aio but not official.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"https://youtu.be/knnlwplqaym


do you think this would be a viable solution?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if you've got the aio connected to the pump header it should show its rpm in the bios, you can also listen closely for a humming from the block, or feel the tubes for a slight vibration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you have an air cooler you could try on it?,you do not even need to have right mounting on it.,just have it rest on the cpu and apply some pressure by hand while you boot and test if it works better.,"if it works well, then you know that your aio is not working.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
take apart the mounting hardware and ensure you assemble it correctly and check for the cpu block film,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the advice everyone.,"from what most are pointing out, the aio seems to be the culprit?",i wish i had a secondary aio to use i might just have to get a new one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes my apologies i am using the z690 motherboard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well if you believe you removed it, look around and see if you can find it (maybe in the bin?","), should say something along the lines of ""warning, remove before installation"".",it likely wouldn't have melted.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"will do this in a moment, thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you find out if the pump is running?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is honestly the most likely.,either that or broken aio.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s really low and shouldnâ€™t be causing those temps.,the mounting pressure of your aio might be bad.,the washer trick some people are using might be useful for you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is that safe for this cpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for starters don't push down on the cooler, just place it on top and slowly tighten it.","even if it was bending you would not hit such high temps at idle, something else is going on here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ohhhh lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ll boot up bios and double check.,i did remember how to ignore cpu fan error so when checking any type of fan speeds they are all set to n/a including aio pump speed which is showing n/a.,would this be a sign of the pump not running?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sadly iâ€™ve never used an air cooler.,this is my 4th build and iâ€™ve always used the z73 with zero issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so, he has used the same aio in 4 different builds without issue and you think maybe the plastic sticker might have sneakily reattached itself onto the cpu block?",ðÿ¤”,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ve got the rig up about a week ago and threw most of the trash away :( i assumed the reason for high cpu temps was originally because i didnâ€™t have the lga 1700 mounting bracket but after installation of the correct bracket iâ€™m stilll running into overheating temps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
only high voltage is bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hmm i'm not 100% sure on that one but even if you ignored the cpu fan, if the pump is plugged into the pump header on the board or a different fan header it should show a reading i think.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no i thought it was a new aio because you mentioned the sticker in another post,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes i have asus z690 hero and my aio_pump port not working.,now on cpu fan port..all ok!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
â€¦.with h150i elite corsair aio,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this one clearly shows your aio pump isn't running

https://i.imgur.com/6jnjq8t.jpeg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think at this point if you've checked that you did remove the sticker from bottom of the aio block you should go get some sort of air cooler and see what the temps are like with that.,that way you'll know if your cooler is the issue or if it's a contact/other issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"very strange, iâ€™ve never seen a chip get that hot in the bios even without a cooler installed.","iâ€™m going to go with faulty chip, if possible can you exchange?",also i assume you meant you have a z690 board?,z590 wonâ€™t support this chip,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i will retry the cpu fan port once more with the correct bracket i just received snd see if that changed anything.,will update you !,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
does the link i attached with my pc stats indicate any issues ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you tried turning off fast boot and increasing boot time?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i havenâ€™t seen the same thing on my z690 hero, but my setup is a bit different to you.","my boot drive is a samsung 980 pro, but not raid.","i also have 2 x wd sn700 drives in raid 0. one of those proved defective and within 48 hours caused my array to drop, but after a power cycle came back.","however wds own smart test failed that drive, so i got it replaced, and the new one has been fine.","iâ€™ve also had an old x99-era 4 x seagate hdd array installed in the system, which also worked okay, but turns out one of the drives is failing which is what prompted me to upgrade to an all solid state system.",especially when i realized just how much noise 4 old 7200 rpm drives actually make!,soâ€¦ no i havenâ€™t seen that.,i would check smart parameters on the drives using hwinfo64 (use summery section not sensors).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
found a potential solid clue here.,"even though i shut down windows properly, the next time it started up, i found this event in the event log:

""the previous system shutdown at 12:48:54 pm on â€ž2/â€ž5/â€ž2022 was unexpected.""","and:

""the system has rebooted without cleanly shutting down first.","this error could be caused if the system stopped responding, crashed, or lost power unexpectedly.""",but none of these things actually happened.,"what happened was i shut down windows, and it appeared to go through a bog-standard shutdown procedure.",is there anything that could be making windows cut the power to the board too early maybe?,some power options i should investigate?,this is pretty weird.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i just turned off fast boot; by increasing boot time, do you mean increasing the post delay?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the suggestion.,"i checked the smart status in the intel ""optane memory and storage management"" tool and it asserts everything is fine, but i'll check with hwinfo64 too.",update: hwinfo64 confirms what the intel tool claims: everything checks out fine with smart.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah this has helped with spinning drives before not sure why m.2's would have this problem but worth a shot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you check the unsafe shutdowns counter?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'll give that a try on the next reboot.,doesn't hurt to have a little more time to hit the del key anyway.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no dice, i'm afraid.","just did a nice, clean shutdown, and it still thinks the raid needs to be verified.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, but see below - the event log contained a log of an unsafe shutdown even though i'd shut down normally.",one other tidbit: doing a \*reboot\* instead of a shutdown does \*not\* cause this problem.,"so i think i'm zeroing in on a power/timing issue here; plausibly power is getting cut too early, before the raid is fully synched.","i am particularly suspicious of the ""erp ready"" setting in the bios, which i've now disabled.","i haven't tried a shutdown with it disabled just yet, but it's a setting i had originally changed from the defaults (in an effort to minimize power consumption) whose description sounds a little suspicious relative to the behavior i'm seeing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your voltages are through the roof.,turn off ai overclocking.,or whatever asus has that auto overclocks your chip.,don't understand why it's on by default.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it says your p0 freq is 5.2ghz.,is that the max boost ratio with mce enabled?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have a lot of experience overclocking on the z590 maximus, so i imagine the uefi is still quite similar, aside from any differences specific to 12th gen",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you do a bios update?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the galahad 360 isn't that good of an aio.,i was upwards of 90c when i used it on my 12900k stock during cinebench r23 x 10min.,i haven't overclocked.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sadly it's not a good time to buy 12900k chips as intel is very likely holding back the top performing ones to sell as the upcoming 12900ks sku.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"are you on auto, no overclock?","if you have a svid behavior field, change it to best case scenario.",the will use your auto voltage curve with lower values.,"they come set to ""typical scenario by default.","there's a chance it might be too low, in which case your pc might bsod during a stress test, but its correctable and if you arent overclocking it 99.9% should still be stable

does the board have multi core enhancement enabled?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that are optimized default, i didn't do aioc, i tried it, but then my temp goes 100 right away.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the vid readings here are preprogrammed for the 53x multiplier by intel.,op's just got a particularly poor bin at sp78.,"asus boards won't break intel spec unless you enable xmp, and even then you're unlikely to see vcore being overshot.","however, what can be done here is to adjust *svid behavior* to *trained*, which should remove some of the voltage headroom preprogrammed by intel (at the potential cost of stability).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"mce will use the stock boost table (5.2 - 5.1 - 5.0 - 5.0 - 4.9 - 4.9 - 4.9 - 4.9), but raise the power and current limits so that the cpu won't throttle down to 240w during heavy loads.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mce is disabled.,it's auto on all except xmp1 for memory.,5200 is what it would set it up if i enabled aioc but in that case there is no way i can cool it down.,even without oc or any changes am i crazy to think that 90c is too high for a decent cooler?,i'll check svid behavior and let you know.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
doesn't sound optimized if it's throwing 1.4v.,for reference mine barely breaks 1.3v on stock settings.,try to figure out how to boot with defaults and none of this optimized stuff.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
optimized default are way too high.,"mine was working on 100mv negative offset which allowed to kill between 15-20*c. stock works on mine (which isnâ€™t good sample) at around 1.19v but there are better samples which are doing 1.10v, but 78 sp is very weak batch.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
look on the right side of the screenshot.,"op is getting 1.48v to the cpu at 5.2ghz

i have a sp79 12900k and it does 1.3v at stock at 4.9ghz.",op is doing a +200mhz overclock at 1.48v and overheating.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well it's running with too high voltage so yes that 90c is way too hot for stock i think, although there are reports of that chip running that high without an overclock, usually it had to do with cooler design or mounting pressure

svid to best case would drop the voltage",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> for reference mine barely breaks 1.3v on stock settings.,"if that's the case, you've either got a good bin (sp90+), or your motherboard is doing something weird.",i know that both asus and msi follows intel ac / dc loadline spec by default.,and leaves it up to the user to adjust these values down slightly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etdmfjkewsa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etdmfjkewsa)

this is what i expected, mine is currently really hungry most of the time peaks over 1.4 and goes crazy high in temp.","since we have same board and cpu

no he's not giving 1.48v to the cpu at 5.2 ghz.,"that number is what asus predicts is needed to set in terms of manual vcore at the given llc for all core 5.2 ghz

the loadline specs are for the vrm.,"a good cpu can run further out of spec, but with vf tuning available, you really shouldn't.","the cpu uses it for droop and ripple compensation so if you give it incorrect values, it won't do it properly.",vid and measured vcore should always be within a few mv of each other.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">didn't bought 12900k to have it run at 4.9

i've got some news for you...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">that number is what asus predicts

dude, look on the upper right.",that's not prediction.,that's the sensor panel.,the predictions are on the lower right.,"since you have an apex, you should know that the core voltage sensor is calibrated so the sensor panel showing 1.483v isn't socket sense nonsense, it's the actual voltage reaching the package.",">also, stock 12900k boost behaviour is 5.2 ghz single core, while all core is 4.9 ghz

default asus bios turbo behavior is all-core turbo in the bios so op set his all-core turbo at 5.1ghz which is overclocking.","this also means asus bios automatically disabled tvb voltage optimizations, giving his cpu another +100mv boost at 45c

source: i also have asus z690 rog bios",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for vid and vcore to match, you need two things

1. correct dc loadline for the given llc-setting - this is quite easy.",2. a motherboard that reports correct vcore - this is very rare.,"ac loadline is meant to be lowered if the vrm is better than spec, and will really only adjust what the cpu asks for as load increases.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your news are that i should be happy to run it at 4.9?,in that case i would be better off with 12700k and 200$ in my pocket?,"i understand cpu is in their margins, but this would be worst bin i ever had and it's among their top tier cpu's",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you get diminishing returns, as always with oc.",at least during benches the temps and amp draw are off the scale with oc.,in gaming there's no difference in performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> but this would be worst bin i ever had and it's among their top tier cpu's

dude, your cpu has a sp of 78, i don't think it's possible to get a lower bin than that.","the average bins are in the mid 80s, while great bins are in the 90s, and unicorns are above 100",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

do you really get better performance by disabling the e cores?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you play on 1440p or 4k gaming difference is hardly noticable like 1%-2% .,i  am going to stick with my 5900x for 4 years minimum and just keep upgrading my gpu .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why do you have ring at stock when you disabled the e-cores?,that's literally the entire point of disabling them.,also what's your cooling setup because 86c with just 5.2 p-cores is very hot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s an upgrade in every way.,how does this have upvotes?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12900k is at 5950x level almost in mt and much faster in st. so it is definitely an upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"12900k is faster than the 5900x in st and mt.. its definitely an upgrade, even if financially its a weird choice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i play on an aw38 with 3080ti ftw.,"i have had the 5900x since launch day, and just made this change last week.","last time i had intel was 8700k, i delided it, and my daughter uses that right now.","it's hard to explain, but everything feels more snappy, and games feel smoother.",i think its the frametimes.,"example in poe, i had 8ms-12ms latency, but now it shows 2ms-3ms latency.","in some games my 3080ti would not go up to 99% usage, and wow as an example with settings at 10, 2xaliasing, i would play at 90-120fps, but it would be up and down a lot.","now i hit 99% usage and can sustain above 120fps all the time, just turning the camera feels so fluid.","again, its hard to explain, but there is a massive difference, gave my 5900x and x570 to wife.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wondering this too.,"outside of benchmarking scores, real world benefit gotta be marginal and pretty insignificant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good point.,maybe it wasn't just a computer upgrade but a relationship upgrade too.,can be hard to put a price on those.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if you're disabling the e cores then the 12700k would have been withing 5% of the performance of the 12900k.,but i guess if your an enthusiast and want the absolute best gaming performance that's still the way to go.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is that necessary?,does it perform better or overclock better with the 8e cores turned off?,do you see any temperature improvements?,"when 12th gen launched i read about a lot of people disabling the e cores in order to gain compatibility with games in windows 10. 

is that still necessary for windows 10 gaming?",and windows 11 for that matter?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

link said datasheet.,you do know those same datasheets also say max operating frequencies lower that many people run them at.,"hedt is a consumer platform, and it isnâ€™t that it has quad channels that let it run 8 ranks per channel, itâ€™s the imc, which is pretty much identical across all lines (server, workstation, high end consumer, and normal consumer) in a given a generation.",those i3 cpuâ€™s that have had ecc support for years now all can run 8 ranks per channel.,youâ€™re arguing for the sake of argument.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

something is up with it.,i have i9-12900k and this is my current idle temps.,https://i.imgur.com/ksbxm8y.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah that's way too high for idle.,you're gonna throttle instantly upon any stress test.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"comparing the standoffs from the lga1700 retrofit kit vs the original lga1150 standoffs that came with my h115i pro rgb, the new ones are longer, which indicates they will perform worse than the old ones since lga1700 is actually shorter than previous sockets.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same spec same idle temp.,"so basically you just replaced the bracket from the back of the motherboard with a solid, non plastic one?","but when i installed the cooler, the back bracket stopped wiggling.",does it seem to be the same cause as yours?,thanks in advance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so was it only caused by the back brackets?,or the mount it self?,"because i have similar temps that u show in ur first photo, but im using icue h100i elite lcd which is newer and comes with supposably the correct mount and brackets no im not sure why my temps are like that, can you tell me what case you use and fans?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i forgot to mention, the backplate (behind the motherboard) wiggles a little bit but the actual part that mounts onto the cpu seems to be seated just fine?",is it possible that too much thermal paste can do that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i ended up breaking my bracket that was with my h115i pro because there was a gap between the board and the bracket from the back (was not sitting flush).,"i grabbed a bracket i had laying around from my old h80, and its been working perfect since.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, once i replaced the bracket, the temperatures were normal again and i didn't have any further issues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"stock fans on the radiator, fractal design r5, and for me yes it was only caused by the back brackets not sitting flush with the cpu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"those temps are way too hot for idle, there is an issue with your cooler mounting or thermal paste or cooler itself (pump or fan speed).",you can also try disabling your boards multi-core enhancement (essentially overclock).,"having too much thermal paste isnt an issue, as with correct pressure it will get squeezed out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"mines seems flush i wiped off old thermal paste that came with the cooler and tried out some new one from kryonaut, i do the line method and always seemed to get good results on previous builds so, now running cinebench to see if my max temps are lower.",because i was thinking maybe its caused by the pre applied thermalpaste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"weird i can not get good temps like u and my case is bigger and has more fans, i re did the cinebench test got a little better temp results but some reason worse score 800 les which makes no sense.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah the bracket that came with the cooler just was wiggling too much, so i used an old one from a previous corsair aio, and it worked perfectly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s just overclocking your cpu.,personally i find the 12700k to be super fast even on stock so i donâ€™t overclock it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"mild performance increase in multithread, but at the cost of higher temps and power draw.","personally i dont think its worth using, but if absolute maximum performance is what you want then leave it on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would you leave all the intel boosts off too?,how much higher temps do you think it causes?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
turned it off and had same temps but lower multithread score by like 800 like you said.,ill probably just leave it on if temps aren't gonna change that much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pl1 and 2?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"that ram is ok, but it seems expensive for the specs.",there are a ton of different cl 16 3200 ddr4 kits listed on amazon right now for about $110-125.,"i don't know what is or isn't on the qvl for that motherboard, or if you just want that kit for the looks and thats worth an extra $25-40 to you but if you haven't looked around you can probably save a little on the ram without losing any performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"with a 2060 and nothing really using rtx io yet, id say it's fine, or even go cheaper for like a wd sn550 as that's more than enough for now and probably a few years.","then if rtx io takes off, get a gen 4 drive at the time which would probably be cheaper.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"so, what's the plan?","seems to me you're using a socket that *does* flex the cpu, you'll lap it flat in reference to that, then you're gonna put it into a board that doesn't flex the cpu... and it'll no longer be flat.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

nice!!,i see the motherboard looks mostly intact in the background.,i won't probe too much in how you did it.,"=p

definitely nsfw...

i am wondering if you could take a photo of the process afterwards?",a photo with a bright light behind the cpu and the photo taken at near eye level of the ihs with the mounting press applied.,and maybe place a level object ontop of the ihs?,this way we can see how flush the lapping process gets!,thanks!,and we expect to see some benchmarks or results after of course!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"and this was also the suggestion by luumi, to find a dead mobo and use socket whcih would bend the cpu so that you could lap it perfectly flat under socket pressure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cause the motherboard was already dead,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably a dead mobo and he only wanted the socket  to grab the cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
metoo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,z690-a pro.,the edge i got used another socket.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have an msi tomahawk and an msi carbon, and neither 'flex' the cpu at all.",both use lotes sockets.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe he could take the springs/clamp from the board he lapped with and put them on the new board?,"obviously can't take the bottom with the solder joints, but i think (??)",you can take off the top mechanism and swap it to a new board.,maybe then it would bend similarly?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

let us know if your temps improved much and whether it was worth the effort.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am still baffled on how people manage to bend pins of these mobo ?,?,"how do you think that happened, genuinely curious no sarcasm :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wont lapping put a gap between the cpu and the cooler surface?,so there wont be any more contact but just filled with thermal paste/liquid metal?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
donâ€™t be!,shhs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"interesting, what chipset are they?",how long have you been using the cpu?,liquid or air cooling?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"correct, and i did have another latch of better quality i started sanding on.",it all worked out great and now i finally have idle temps a few degrees from ambient.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my cpu was bent really bad, so i had terrible temps.. i will ofc do a report back once my rig is up and running again!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ve built over 50 pcs.,first one iâ€™ve fakked up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the cpu gets bent by the socket.,so if you lap the cpu by itself outside the socket itll be flat sure but as soon as you put it in the socket pressure will be put in the middle so that the top and bottom of cpu bow upwards thus the ihs is no longer flat.,thats why hes lapping it in the socket so itll be flat in the socket.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"afaik cpu lapping isnâ€™t just to improve contact on the tim, but rather to decrease the amount of material between the cpu die itself and the cpu cooler without the substantiated risk from running direct die!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lapping doesn't remove that much material.,the cooler is pushing down on the cpu with pressure.,lapping only just removes the high points and makes it an even plane.,you'd have to go way too far with the lapping process for what you described to be an issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"hopefully they make a reference model as i'd like to buy directly from intel, if possible.",i like this dual slot/dual fan design.,aibs will very likely recycle their amd/nvidia coolers and as a result will produce triple slot/triple fan monstrosities which i'm not a fan of.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel has already confirmed they will have aib partners selling cards.,"whether they make their own founders edition is a bit more unknown, but my guess is they probably will.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ever since xe gpus first appeared on mobile devices people were trying to compare them against amd's vega igpus since it was the first time that intel was actually competitive when it came to igpu performance.,however from the start those people have repeatedly run into issues where some games simply wouldn't run on xe gpus and afaik this is still a thing.,so it's rather worrying that despite xe gpus being on the market for over a year now intel still hasn't managed to fix their drivers.,[here's paul's hardware video where he tried to compare the igpu performance of the ryzen 5 4650g to the i5-11400 and run into driver crashes on the intel system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7qthhhp-ho&t=559s).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

oh that is true i've read such reports too.,"basically their drivers have bad game support or gaming features, plus most games aren't optimised for intel igpus.","i think it's not just intel's fault(game creators can optimise their games for igpus too), but intel can definitely do something about the stability issues too",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no.,13th gen/raptor lake is supposed to increase the e-cores count.,but you're looking at things wrong.,"the reason intel settled on 6 performance cores is because basically every game and application uses 6 or less cores, and if they are highly multithreaded then 4 e-cores are way better to have than 1 p-core.","and with the current ipc gains, 6 p-cores from 12th gen beat 8 p-cores from 11th gen. similarly the new 4 core i3 can beat the old 6 core i5.","so you need to look beyond just core count, and at ipc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is a fair point i have found that my gaming laptop (asus tuf a15 rtx3050ti ryzen 7 5000 something) lasts only few hours on low power mode and it weighs a quarter ton so getting homework done was always a pain in the ass i eventually got an acer 3 with an i7 (11th gen i donâ€™t remember which one) and that lasts for ever and though itâ€™s a lot less power itâ€™s still better for writing papers and stuff cause i can actually take it someplace quiet to study (asus has become my desktop for all intense and purpose until i can afford to build one),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

agreed.,"transistor density is generally a better measurement than the now useless ""nm"" monicker.","but again, even that have flaws.","density on a piece of cpu for example, is all over the place.","logic part of the die for example, has way lower density than the cache part.",and caches between different arch can have different density even when using the same process node.,"so yeah, it is a better measurement as it shows something more tangible, but i wish we have something else that is more foolproof.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah it's pretty clear why they renamed their nodes, i don't why they get shit for it why it's clear intel 7 (or 10nm+++++ for memelords) is a very good node and competitive with n7.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

eh intel isn't broke but they're definitely the underdog for all the wrong reasons.,"making krzanich ceo, firing tens of thousands of people, stuck on one node for six years.","they're in a position they can't come back from with money alone, especially since asml/zeiss can only produce so many machines every year.",if things keep going south they'll really mirror amd's old path of having to spinoff foundries and go third party.,i hope that doesn't happen though because the chip situation will be even worse than it is now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably extends past that.,"remember alder lake isnt even zen 4's competition, raptor lake is expected to release months earlier than zen 4, and then meteor lake is expected to launch a few months after zen 4.

"don't forget about this,

the e-core clusters in raptor lake are receiving twice the amount of l2 cache compared to alder lake.",for the p-cores the l2 cache increases from 1.25mb per core to 2mb going from 12th gen to 13th gen. this information is very important as it means that the e-cores of raptor lake will even game better than the alder lake's e-cores despite being the same gracemont cores.,"[https://www.techpowerup.com/290976/intel-raptor-lake-rumored-to-feature-massive-cache-size-increases](https://www.techpowerup.com/290976/intel-raptor-lake-rumored-to-feature-massive-cache-size-increases)

zen 4 in comparison doubles the l2 cache per core over zen 3 from 512kb to 1mb.",which means that zen 4 is coming with half the l2 cache per core compared to raptor cove p-cores.,and as amd admitted that v-cache is expensive i don't expect them to ship a zen 4 v-cache chip in the consumer space as the additional stacked cache will need to be on the same expensive 5nm node.,"[https://www.hardwaretimes.com/5nm-amd-zen-4-ryzen-6000-cpus-coming-in-november-2022-rumor/](https://www.hardwaretimes.com/5nm-amd-zen-4-ryzen-6000-cpus-coming-in-november-2022-rumor/)

what type of cooling are you using?,an open loop?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
been over clocking since 1999 when i was a pre-teen.,the maturity of your products and the optimization app profiles just makes my heart warm up to see how well intel chips perform these days.,"we always cross compare products naturally, but comparing intel then vs intel now just shows the innovation is never lacking.",just need the time to produce the best stuff on earth.,great job!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how in the world.. i can barely reach 24k with my 12700k at 5.1.... sadge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
absolutely.,it is a more relevant clock for alderlake due to the hybrid design(stock clock is 3.3ghz).,its primarily the reason you see people disabling the e-cores solely due to the ring ratio.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, its crazy right?",especially with the number of threads compared to the xeon and threadripper.... makes me want to get a 12700k as well just coz its powerfull but wont add that much fps increase (running an i7-8700+3080ti on a 5120x1440 sometimes 8560x1440),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what other settings like voltage mode and value and llc did you use?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe the 4.4 ring?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nothing.,my powerdraw and voltage is way higher than yours (probably) for an extra 3% score in cinebench.,if you really want that extra 3% push e-cores to 4.2 all ring to 4.4 or 4.5 and p-cores to 5.1 all (5.2 if you can handle cooling like 280w+),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"dont worry dude, my 5.1 is like 23k to 23.6k ish lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's insane 5.4 with only p-cores?,i can hit 5.2 all-core with an insane amount of core voltage (1.43v+ under load for it to be stable) it would require like 1.47v when not under load.,i currently have turbo ratio offset +4 with a 5.1ghz all p-core 4.2 all e-core 4.4 ring at 1.36v under load.,test stability with prime95 smallest ffts btw (without hyperthreading...) i would be curious if that is stable.,i say without hyperthreading because even at 1.36v under load prime95 with hyperthreading tries to draw like 320w and instantly crashes from overcurrent protection.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"according to [gaming benchmarks](https://youtu.be/lzhwvluvork?t=799), the 5800x actually uses slightly more power than 12600k, and [at full maximum load](https://youtu.be/lzhwvluvork?t=440) both are very close to each other with 12600k being just 2 - 4% more efficient, but the thing is 12600k outperforms it by 13% according to [cinebench r23 testing](https://youtu.be/lzhwvluvork?t=200)

so, i'd say that 12600k is more efficient compared to 5800x when it comes to performance / watt.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"likely the intel would use less power when running most tasks and games, especially if you're not using extremely high fps or if you use a fps limiter.",amd would be more efficient if you're doing often 90%+ utilization.,"if you leave your computer idle for a long time or if most of what you do is small stuff(web browsing/video), then intel will pull far ahead, since amd's desktop cpus(except for g apus) have high idle power consumption causing a bit of overhead there.","if your real concern is power consumption however, you shouldn't be looking at any k variant intel.","in your comparison, the 12600k would use less power in most situations.","if you're only going k for the e cores, then downclocking the p cores a little bit would likely increase efficiency by a decent amount.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hi, 

power efficiency depends on your use cases.","in gaming, the i5 12600k is slightly more efficient than the r7 5800x.","however, if you use your pc for rendering and over cpu-stressing stuff and you don't set a proper power limit in bios, the i5 12600k will bemore power consuming than the r7 5800x.","br, nexocgaming",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"everyone's giving you percentages on why intel is better but it honestly, does.",not.,matter.,you're talking about cents on the dollar.,maybe 2-3 more dollars a year if you went with amd.,so if you have an am4 motherboard already just pick up the 5800x if you can find it at a good price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"at the same performance, alder lake is more efficient than zen3.","at the same wattage, alder lake is more powerful than zen3.",you can't compare power efficiency between two when one delivers 20%-50% more performance than the another.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
both are great chipsâ€¦ thereâ€™s lots of minor pros and cons of each.,"really, the power consumption is a relatively negligible point of differentiation.",iâ€™d challenge most users to calculate the average watt delta between one or the other chip for their use case and integrate that over a years electricity.,"unless you are crunching your cpu around the clock and/or have high electricity costs, it typically does not amount to anything.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it was once calculated based on california power prices that the 9900k would cost you around $6 more per year to power than the 3900x.,there was a pretty big power draw difference between those two chips and the energy savings was still barely enough to buy lunch from mcdonaldâ€™s.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12600k under full 100% load will use the same power as a 5800x.,"the 12600k under gaming loads, or general use, uses less than the 5800x.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
multi-thread wise they're identical while the 5800x is more efficient single-thread wise.,"two things:

1) you could always set power limits for a *slight* performance decreases while lowering the power consumption substantially.","2) if you're considering the 5800x then you should also consider the 12700(f), if you aren't overclocking (which you probably aren't since you're more concerned about energy efficiency) then going with a 12700(f) might make more sense than both a 12600k(f) and a 5800x as efficiency-wise it's similar to both while being much better in multi-threaded than both.",overall i doubt you'd notice any difference between the two in your electric bill.,"let's say worst case scenario in both electricity cost and workload, we'll say 39 cents per kilowatt hour (i used germany's electricity cost converted to usd, i specifically used germany because it has the most expensive electricity i could find), and everything you're doing is single-threaded (to give the advantage to the 5800x), ignoring any advantage intel has because of higher single-threaded performance (which would mean it would take less time to complete the same workload), single-thread the 12600k uses 11w more than the 5800x (from the link you posted), even if you're having it run 8 hours a day, you're talking an extra ~$1.04 per month / ~$12.53 per year, but keep in mind i made the scenario as unrealistic as possible to show how little of an increase in money it would add to your electric bill.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what gpu do you use?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i find an extra few watts from the cpu really doesn't matter when gpus pull over 300w+ for lols these days,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"5800x should use more electricity both idle & under light load, both should be quite equal under heavy load (also dependant on silicone lottery & board used).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
doesn't the 12600k and 5800x perform similarly?,(maybe i'm misinformed but this is what i remember seeing in the reviews),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's at 24/7/365 full loads.,"at light/moderate loads, it evens out to almost no difference.","if it's idle 24/7 (not judging) ryzen even shifts towards losing, as the i/o die is a 15w constant draw no matter the load, while intel only has 6w chipset draw.",cpu-only idle wattage is the same between them though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"but if you only use it to play triple a titles which are gpu throttled, only 5%-10% increase is indeed what you get.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

are you actually getting any power limit throttling?,"it is very common for motherboards to by default to ignore power limits, so that setting may not actually do anything in practice.","regardless, you can set power limits to whatever you want in intel xtu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how does xtu affect bios settings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for actually useful frequencies on xmp/overclock ram expect something like 3600-4000mhz ddr4 before the memory controller slows down.,not sure about ddr5 but probably any stick available now can run at xmp...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel adheres to the jedec spec when it lists support ram speeds.,motherboard manufacturers list whatever they know the processor and their board can handle.,that's why something like the meg unify-x lists support for 7000mhz.,"and no, you won't be denied warranty using ram rated at those speeds unless you crank the voltage to something unreasonable.",even then it's hard to prove.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the ddr4 memory controller on alder lake seems to hit it's limits somewhere around 2.05 ghz, that's ddr4-4100 in gear 1, while gear 2 would potentially allow for ddr4-8200 (given no other internal limits).","for ddr5, the limit seems to be harder to reach.","while it's not unfeasible to boot ddr5-7000 on a single stick, it's hard to know if the limit is the memory chips or the memory controller.","still, ddr5-6000 should be readily achievable for most boards and 12th gen cpus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ddr4 3600mhz
ddr5 5200mhz",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the official support says 3200 and 4800 for ddr4 and 5 respectively.,but u can easily run 3600 or 4000mhz ddr4 or 6000 mhz ddr5.,those support things only matter if you're running on a h610 or a non ram overclocking supported chipset,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"why do people benchmarks it with ddr5 6000mhz or ddr4 4400mhz

those speed should not be supported 

example: https://youtu.be/-ujg7aitwhi",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this guy also doesn't enable xmp because it's technically overclocking.. you do realize that what intel lists is jdec spec just like how all ddr5 ram you buy is all the same 4800mhz base.,the imc is probably comparable to the higher spec chips and on a 2dimm board with expensive hynix memory you could probably get 6600 ez(makes no sense to use 600 dollar ram on a 300 dollar cpu but whatever),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they are trying to push the cpu to its max with those speeds.,the only difference ive ever seen with higher speeds is when i was editing in adobe premiere pro.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> example: https://youtu.be/-ujg7aitwhi

just a quick look and that channel appears to be fake (as in they're not actually doing any benchmarks), i wouldn't take those types of channels seriously (if they don't show actually owning hardware then you should avoid the channel like the plague, especially avoid channels with low subscriber counts that are somehow getting hardware before it's even released), they don't show hardware, and that channel in particular isn't even showing recordings of the benchmarks, they're using a different video and posting fps from who knows where.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so are you saying that those speed are supported?,you are not clear,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel guarantees compatibility with 3200mhz sticks.,"everything else is overclocking, you cannot claim warranty or rmas for incompatibility with higher speed memory, as they are theorically not supported.",most support from higher speed compatibility comes from motherboard vendors.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh i see.,thanks iâ€™ve understood now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you can still use warranty, just donâ€™t tell them you oc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is a parameter called tau that sets how long the system will boost.,most motherboards set it to infinity so there is no time limit.,you can change it but not necessary since you have very low temp anyway.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wish they would drop that base & turbo junk and go by an all core boost clock and that's it.,"in win10+11 you never get to see the turbo anyway, unless you force the cpu to put the other cores to sleep.","take my i5-10400f base 2,9ghz turbo 4,3ghz and the reality is 4,0 ghz all core until it's going back to idle.",and sadly this number is not on the package or listing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for clearing that up for me.,i was under the impression motherboards - at least lower-end ones - pretty much had an unalterable time limit for tau.,"it's been a while since i paid attention to pc tech or dug into a bios, so i'm obviously misunderstanding some of the info i'm seeing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"seriously.my 9900k goes to 5ghz on like 1-2 cores for smaller tasks but 4.7ghz all core boost on anything worth while doing like gaming (or anything intensive really)

first thing i did on  9900k was  force constant 4.7ghz so it doesn't go up and down.all those power saving features can cause more issues then they're worth.",(for desktops),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
agreed.,i'd much rather the marketing & specs highlight sustained speeds rather than temporary or potential/hypothetical.,"i mean, obviously all speeds are potential/hypothetical but sustained is a more useful metric and it would give a clearer picture of what we'll be seeing in home/work use.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"tau, pl1, pl2, etc are usually locked on laptops (since the cooling is fixed), but otherwise most systems let you set it to whatever you want.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that might be where my wires got crossed.,it's also just as likely that i misunderstood info about this while researching my options before buying the i3.,not that it matters at this point.,"the 10105 was a ""i need a computer now"" purchase meant to buy me time until i felt comfortable making a more serious purchase.","i placed an order today for the 12600k, faster ram, and a z690 board.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so, uhâ€¦ you are overclocking, with a huge negative voltage offset, and your memory defaults to 4800 when you enable xmp, and things are crashing when you force 5600?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
go back to stock with the cpu.,make sure you're on the latest bios.,there are serious ram improvements.,once that's out of the way start your overclocking.,"the samsung chips on that ram, while not as good as hynix, should be able to hit over 6000 with even tighter timings than xmp.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the nh-d15 may be overkill for a 12600k unless you plan on some overclocking which in my opinion is not really worth it.,i have one cooling my 12600k only because i had it before with my 9900k which ran a lot hotter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

a or b?,answer: yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah it will.,that's the one area where you probably will see the largest decline because you are going from boosting to 5ghz to like 4ghz lmfao.,you literally lose like 15%+ performance.,why buy an i7 then if you are basically just going to use an i5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lga 1700,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
setting power limits to intel spec for example doesn't effect gaming performance at all.,intel spec is 125w and games tend to use 50-90w and some certain games might spike it up to 120w on loading screen but thats about it.,multi core enhancement doesn't give any performance on gaming.,">you are going from boosting to 5ghz to like 4ghz lmfao

gaming you usually use more then 1 core so you won't see 5ghz boost anyways.",all core boost i believe was 4.7ghz which cpu will hit fine and usually boost when gaming and 4 core load you see 4.9ghz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
125w isn't spec for boost that is spec for stock which is...  3.6ghz lol.,turbo boost tdp is 190w.,there is no way you can hit turbo boost all core stable 65w below intel's own specs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>125w isn't spec for boost that is spec for stock which is... 3.6ghz lol.,"turbo boost tdp is 190w

where did i mention spec for boost?",no where.,while gaming you can reach all core boost clocks with under 100w which is 4.7ghz.,even while browsing you can reach 4 core boost clock speed which is 4.9ghz under 60w... it comes down to how much power cpu needs to keep it stable.. good example is cpu z stress test which is closest to gaming you get 4.7ghz all core boost with 115w and 100% cpu usage...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you have a fixed cpu core you can disable c-states/speedshift and speedstep as in some cases it helps in stability and less micro stutter from some reports.,dont bother with hpet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you never need to disable any of the intel c-states or cpu power saving features.,the chips overclock out of the box.,and they also downclock to idle states automatically.,the c-states are what enables the chip to downclock so quickly.,don't touch them.,"in your bios, you can easily adjust the multiplier (without even adjusting voltages) and you'll see your chip clocked at that higher speed.",then close all apps except for your monitoring program and you will see it race back down to idle.,even your bios hides these features from you.,your bios typically shows you everything you need in order to overclock on the very first pages.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in general leave things at defaults unless you are doing some real special tuning or don't care about power consumption at all.,i think that is probably enabled for all of those,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what do you mean by fixed cpu core ?,you mean default stock settings without any overclocking ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
like setting a 4.7ghz (as an example) on all cores.,usually if you use the high performance power plan in windows all your cores use the same frequency.it's not a matter of default/oc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

cinebench is using the avx instruction set which can cause a lot of heat.,"""multicore enhancement"" will apply the max clock speed to all (performance) cores, which probably won't work well unless you have proper cooling or reduce the voltage manually.","if you don't want to undervolt/overclocking manually, i suggest you leave ""multicore enhancement"" disabled for now and try to run prime95 (small fft) without avx.",watch the temps.,it shouldn't reach max temp immediately.,"if it does, something isn't right with your cooling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if it's cooling, it might be a hardware issue.",there have been many reports recently about lga1700 mobos warping and cooling blocks not covering the cpu fully.,i would take of the cooling unit and check if the paste got an even spread as that's one of the indicators.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think i found the issue.,my cpu retainer specifically the square part that holds the cpu down is bent.,"i'm about to make another post because i'm pretty sure it might have been like this from the factory, i can't see any reason why it would bend in my system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there's a deeper issue with my pc.,this cooler should be sufficient.,if you are interested click my profile and check out my latest post.,my retainer is actually bent.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i genuinely can't see the problem from those photos and would be amazed if the retainer was bent but good luck with rma,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it definitely shouldn't do that.,i assume you are referring to [this](https://www.igorslab.de/en/bad-cooling-at-alder-lake-problems-at-socket-lga-1700-on-the-lane-among-all-remedies/) issue?,"yeah, can't really help here.",good luck with that.,just be careful not to fasten the screws too tight.,"there is a german saying ""nach fest kommt ab.""","(after ""firm"" comes ""off"") meaning if you tighten too much, usually something breaks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, please do not run prime95 without your cpu cooler.",it won't help.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the cooler (if installed correctly) is not the issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my own testing seems to indicate noctuas are overrated these days.,"i have a (slightly different to d15) d15s which only performs similar to a scythe mugen 5, and both being beaten by a thermalright peerless assassin, cooling a 5800x.","edit: after thinking about it, my results are probably because of the high heat density of the 5800x die, but that doesn't explain to me why the thermalright performs better than both.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so it looks like the exact problem i was referencing.,the bending comes from the fact that the clamps for lga1700 are exerting more force than past versions while the materials used for the surrounding hardware is the same.,i even found a similar case with your cooler: [here](https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/intel-lga-1700-socket-problem.289718/post-4683026).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the cooler is in most workloads.,the case / case coolers might not be.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hey me too!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes but i found a deeper issue.,"my actual retainer, the square holder over the cpu is bent.",i'm about to post again with some images cause i'm pretty worried.,there is nothing in my pc that could have caused this bend.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
d15s and 5800x owner here.,"that's because the peerless assassin has two 120 mm fans, while the others have single fans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no my clamp is bent.,upwards.,i seriously suggest you check out my latest post on my profile.,it might help you understand.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
please i suggest you look at my other post.,"the retaining clamp is bent, not the cpu, not the motherboard.",the clamp.,it's bents upwards away from the board.,this shouldn't be possible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the d15, in turn, costs as much as a 360mm aio.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
except i bought another noctua a15 so the d15s had two 150mm fans vs mugen and pa's 2x120mm.,"that's more than double the cost of a peerless assassin (even if i'm using arctic p12s on them, those are cheap).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i did, it's all connected to the same root cause.","sometimes the mobo will get bent, sometimes the connectors break and sometimes the cpu cover warps.",it all depends which is the weakest component.,"honestly, at this point it's hard to tell if the reason behind the issues is really choice of materials by manufacturers or a design flaw of the socket itself.",imho they didn't want to change the clamping too much so that cooling units can be adjusted easier but it's causing the force to not be spread evenly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that shouldn't have any difference on cooling or pretty much anything.,i've ran pc without that bracket at all and cpu cooler on top of that cpu.,cpu cooler wad ziptied on the motherboard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean to quit nutting :d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"when dealing with cpu coolers, you should understand that bigger doesn't mean cooler, it means higher thermal capacity before full heat-soak and throttling.",i own the d15 with 2x 150mm fans and recently picked up the u12a with 2x 120mm fans.,tested on an older i7-4930k @ 4.5ghz all six cores and the u12a held a marginal 1-3\*c lower temp than my d15.,this will be due to the nature of single fin setup with a push pull fan setup.,"the d15 middle fan is pulling air from one stack and pushing to 2nd stack, whilst the 2nd fan is pulling from 2nd stack to atmosphere.",you can appreciate that the 2nd fin will always be receiving warmer air from first fin (warmer than cool air entering tower).,"because of the size of the d15 and fans, they can run slower, providing lower volume thermal efficiency equal to the u12a, while the u12a fans by size and single stack must run faster (and louder) to achieve the same performance.","if noise is no concern, you can always change the u12a 2x120mm fans from the noctua standards to the noctua 3000 rpm models, but consider airflow out of case because these would make some turbulence haha (probably worth lightly ducting air from cooler to rear vent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm sorry but i don't see how it's related, you can see on the clamp that there is damage, on close inspection it has a really thin line that looks like a scratch, the area around that is dented (i can tell because it reflects light differently) and then i can also see what appears to be damage caused by a dragging action or angled pressure of some sort, one end of the damage slowly tapers to a point.",i fail to see how this could have been caused by simply clamping in the cpu.,"or installing the cooler, nothing comes into contact with this area, i have checked.","i cannot bend this part, it is simply too strong because of the right angles bent on the sides.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it is not a curve across the entire part either, it is a single isolated bend at the point of the damage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it creates an absolutely insane amount of pressure on the cpu, that's the problem here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in that case i hope you succeed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my comment is a reaction to the popularity of the noctua d15 in terms of performance.,"the u12a might perform better, but at its price the **value** isn't there for me at all.",we can buy similar or better performance for less price.,"i suppose i should've said overpriced instead of overrated, but the way they are praised online makes me think they are overrated too (with great support though, awesome free mounting systems for new sockets).","i'm not a ""best performance for whatever price"" kind of guy, so noctua makes little sense to **me.","** i can buy two thermalright or sycthe coolers for the price of a single u12a and have performance for two rigs that maybe lose a couple of degrees to a u12a (or maybe even perform better), or use the extra money to buy another part, or buy a slightly more expensive cooler that's still a lot cheaper than a u12a and have extra cash for rgb fans that make my games go faster :))",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i doubt it.,"if your cpu works as it should, the pressure isn't very high.","there are cases where cpu cooler is over tightened, the pressure on cpu is too high, and the pc doesn't boot.","when the cooler is loosened, the pc boots.",it is a symptom of insane ampunt of pressure.,how was the contact patch on the cooler?,was the thermal paste applied evenly on the bottom of the cooler?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, it was obviously contacting better at both ends and not in the middle.",just like all the images of people with cpus that are bending.,"if i place the cpu on the cooler out of my pc, they sit perfectly flat together, so the cpu is no longer bent by the pressure because it isn't in the system.",i have also tried closing the latch mechanism without a cpu in the socket and it is still in my opinion way too much pressure to close the lever.,"because of the bend in the top plate, it has to bend about a mm or two further than it should in order to properly latch closed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
please post an image of both the cooler and cpu after proper installation.,"if the latch is closed and it's almost as stiff as with cpu, the cpu doesn't get much pressure.",also computer parts are not that fragile as many tend to believe.,"i mean, sure you may have to be able to use excessive force, but i have never met that kind of issue and i have hard to believe that would cause any problems at all.",you can also try to mount the cpu cooler without the bracket and see if it chances anything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
remount your cooler.,your chip is throttling.,"and run hwinfo64 to watch your voltages, cpu power draw, frequencies, and throttling status.",stock you should be getting like 26800-27500 type range.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"check if your thermo paste got even spread on the cooler, if not it might be a sign of warping.",this is like a 3rd or 4th post i've seen here just toady about the new cpus under-performing or going too hot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thank for your help guys, i was able to remount the cooler and now the results looks much better from 26.5k to 27k, but i feel like the head is still causing some cpu throttling

what is warping?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""to become, or make something become twisted, or bent out of its natural shape, for example because it has become too hot, too wet, etc.""",- oxford dictionary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's called pcie bifurcation.,you can split the pcie 5.0x16 lanes (normally for a dedicated x16 gpu slot) into x8+x8 or x8+x4+x4.,note these are actual pcie 5.0 lanes (the only ones available).,"so if the mobo has a pcie 5.0 nvme, it has to be bifurcated from the x16 lanes of the gpu.",the cpu also has 4 dedicated pcie4.0 lanes (for the nvme).,"using these will not influence these gpu lanes whatsoever

then it also has 8 (dmi4.0 equivalent to pcie4.0) lanes to the chipset and the chipset splits these in all other devices.",these are separate again from the x16 5.0 for the gpu and the x4 4.0 for the primary nvme.,tldr: bifurcation only happens if the mobo has and you utilize a nvme pcie5.0 slot.,"if you have a mobo that has such a slot, just put the nvme in the pcie4.0 slot and your gpu will run on x16 and the nvme at x4 at the same time (nothing will be shared).",you're unlikely to have a pcie5.0 nvme anyway.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i asked this same question, theres no lane sharing on the msi pro z690a",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there are only a couple z690 boards with a pcie 5.0 m.2 slot.,"for example the asus rog strix z690-e. and yes, on those very few boards, using that m.2 would force the gpu to run x8.","but since thatâ€™s not a great idea, this isnâ€™t a common implementation.","as others have said, there is no lane sharing on the   msi z690-a.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think pcie lane can be assigned via the bios.,i could be wrong though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you only get the m2_1/pcie x4/x8 split if your motherboard decided to add a pcie switch to enable pcie5 m2_1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the explanation on that.,"so the msi pro, in addition to the pcie 5.0 x16 slot and pcie 4.0 x4 nvme slot from the cpu, has 2 more pcie 4.0 x4 nvme slots and 1 pcie 3.0 x4 nvme slot from the chipset.","it also has a pcie 3.0 x4, and two pcie 3.0 x1 slots from the chipset.","all of those, and the sata and usb ports, etc.",add up to way more than 8 lanes (just two of the nvme m.2 slots alone do).,how does it manage to distribute lanes across all of these on the chipset?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks, i was curious about this too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"alder lake can only bifurcate its main pcie 5.0 16x port to 8x/8x, not 8x/4x/4x like in previous generations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the chipset is like a hub.,all of these devices share the same bus (eg.,it will be bottle-necked if all of these devices are consuming data at the same time).,so the chipset does not 'distribute' the lanes but it shares them to the downstream devices.,"but it's not really likely to cause issues, but it is a reason to install your primary nvme into the cpu nvme slot.","it was a much bigger issue with for example intel 10gen, because that did not have dedicated nvme pcie lanes (so the nvme was always connected to the chipset), ã¡nd it was just dmi3.0x4 (!!)",to the chipset.,"now with 12th gen, there is dedicated nvme pcie lanes for at least one of the slots, and the dmi to the chipset is upgraded to 4.0x8  (4x the bandwidth!)",so much less likely to cause a bottleneck.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"alright, that's good to know.",so let me see if i understand.,"if i were to, hypothetically, fill every pcie, nvme, and sata slot, that wouldn't necessarily bottle-neck the devices because they won't all be consuming the bandwidth at the exact same time.","that is, of course, unless i decided to do file transfers across every drive simultaneously or something like that.","and even then, the dedicated cpu lanes to the gpu and first m.2 slot would remain unaffected.",is this correct?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

>5950x basically is max silicon quality.,but 2 chiplets  - more latency for high framerate gaming this makes a difference.,also runs hotter so lower sustained clocks.,with years what i've meant is that this is intel's newest and greatest compared to amd gen that's about to be replaced.,"fair comparison is to 11th gen.

comparing like this will always favor most recent one provided that both intel and amd will keep up their current development speed.",don't get me wrong - finally we have a steady progress in cpu space and that's great.,also i'm no fanboy.,i buy performance required at best possible price point which today would be tough as i need cores for my massively paralel workload but intel 12th gen almost makes it up in single core performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i didnt...

but newer tech should be faster than older tech..

that said.","its impressive that a ""mid range"" i5 can keep up with a high end model.. with just 1 years advantage.","an awesome step, compared to when intel launched the 11000 series which in some cases were slower than the previous gen.

there's a recent post here from someone with the same board who discovered the cpu mounting clamp was warped.,"many things tend to warp around socket 1700, i would take off the cooling unit and see if the paste got an even spread, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah, defo check the cooler, mounting clamp and cpu itself (people have reported even connectors broken from warping).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what you should do is tweak the voltage.,1.35v is excesive for stock operations.,"my 12700k needs like 1.16v to be stable at 4.7ghz, and isn't even a good bin.",almost 23000 points in cb and 68 ish c on air.,"so yes, that ludicrous voltage might have the most blame for the absurd temperatures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i reseated the cooler, no difference in temps",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so changing the voltage will decrease my temps and increase score?,will it affect the longitivity of the cpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

could be.,what motherboard and case are you building with?,i had two issues.,the first was the physical incompatibility that was keeping the gpu from seating in the slot correctly.,that was causing blue screens and video card related crashes.,"i fixed that, but continued to get crashes.",turns out my memory was unstable when running xmp 2. switched to xmp 1 and things improved.,i was still getting some weirdness and so i upped my vdd and vddq voltages to 1.25. everything has been stable since then.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you can set the power limits in bios.,iâ€™ve done this myself to a 12700k on the asus b660i since the non-k version was basically the same price.,arguably you get better silicon in the k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and thereâ€™s no reason to just limit yourself to 65w.,maybe your case/cooler can handle 75w or 85w or more.,you can tweak this to your heartâ€™s content.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12700 is sold out a lot in the us.,"you can order it in tray form (no retail box, no cooler) https://www.shopblt.com/item/intel-i7-12700-desktop-proc-12/intel_cm8071504555019.html

as for your question, yes you can power limit a 12700k to 65w, or whatever you want without issue.","gaming/st performance stays very good, as most games only want that much power anyways, youll obviously see a decrease in multithreaded performance, but from what ive seen a 65w 12700 still beats a max power 11900k.","and for the record, most boards let you do the opposite, and use full pl1=pl2 (max possible power) with locked cpus, so rarely are people actually using the locked 12700 at 65w.",tldr; yes you can do exactly what you want.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i also went for a 12700k and limited its power draw on the rog strix b660-i because the non-k wasn't available at the retailers that i shop from (microcenter, specifically).","currently, i'm running the 12700k at 100w, and am happy with the results.","i don't have any detailed benchmark results for you, but here is one for the 12900k power limited to various watts:

keep in mind that the above benchmark doesn't test all configurations.","if you're just gaming, you can also disable the e-cores to free up additional power for the p-cores.","as to whether the results are the same as the non-k at the same voltage, i would assume so but it's hard to say.","theoretically, both cpus are the same, but just binned differently.",we don't know intel's exact binning criteria.,"even within the same sku, you can get different samples with different power efficiencies.","but my guess is that on average, they will be essentially the same.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"awesome, yeah i was aware i could set power limits, i was just afraid it would really hurt performance in a way that it wouldnâ€™t make sense to do anymore.",i tried to do this with a 5800x and it would just stay below base clocks permanently,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hey im thinking of getting a 12700 or 12700f but i canâ€™t decide, i donâ€™t oc but the 12700k seems way better out of the box?",ill be getting a b660 mobo but iâ€™m seeing that the 12700 or f. is 65w locked?,canâ€™t i make it 125w like the k so it runs the same as the k instead of slower?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"right, i think the l9i can actually perform decently a bit above 65w loads",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"being completely honest for 20-50 bucks iâ€™d much rather go with the 12700k, just for the resale value if i ever end up selling it, but i wanted to confirm whether if the performance is gonna be drastically affected by applying such a low power limit on a chip thatâ€™s supposed to require 125w.","thanks for the links though, might be smarter to just get the f version since i do have a dgpu anyway",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m pushing 90w with the same cooler in a dan a4 and i lose about 15% vs a stock 12700k in blender.,all-p-core boost about 4.3ghz.,temps around 85-90c so quite toasty.,but in gaming it stays about 60-70 with a 60w pull and in the few single core benchmarks iâ€™ve done itâ€™s on par with stock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you should be able to do that.,12700 goes to 180w if your cooler can handle it and the mobo can set power limits and/or multi core enhancement.,"slightly lower max clocks on both p and e cores compared to 12700k, but that shouldnâ€™t be noticeable.",i say should because it depends on the mobo.,i only know for sure that asus b660i can do it with a 12700k because thatâ€™s what iâ€™m running.,youâ€™ll have to research your board.,there is nothing in the cpu that stops you from raising power limits.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that thing is good above 100w if your case airflow is evicting the hot air even moderately.,"all you have to do is spin up intel xtu, start an all core, small-fft prime95 load, and then tweak your power limits until your cpu temp falls to the mid 90's c (temp is only bad if you try to overclock.","stock settings are tuned for safe operation at 100c, 24/7/365 for the length of the warranty, so lesser workloads and temps will last the chip forever.).","after that bit of tuning, only the worst workloads will get your cpu hot, and other workloads like gaming will keep it colder.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what did you do in the end?,i just bought a second hand 12700 and i absolutely love it.,i can't believe how little power this thing uses and it performs so well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got the 12700k and iâ€™m currently using it power limited to 65w.,i donâ€™t really use it to its full potential though so iâ€™m probably gonna sell it and get a 12400 instead,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how does it perform at 65w then?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"â€œto attract the kind of high-paying, advanced manufacturing jobs, cities and states need an abundant share of college graduates, a steady flow of new graduates and communities in which these workers will desire to live.","thatâ€™s a sobering lesson for states like neighboring indiana, which can compete â€“ or even beat â€“ ohio on tax breaks, tax rates and regulatory environment, but falls short in quality of life and educational attainment.â€

"yeah, pretty much.",there are a couple (i.e.,more than once) of interviews where intel marketing employees stated that k skus were higher bins but intel generally treats this as trade secret and doesn't talk about it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you need to be a lot more detailed about your question.,"which i7 and i9, because a 12700k for example beats an 11900k.",you also need to say what you want to do with the cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it sounds like you can afford either one.,go with the i9 before you regret it down the road.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

was in the same boat as you when i was building my pc.. decided to go with i9 just in case i ever want to start streaming etc.,"it does help i work at best buy, so the 10850k i got was almost $100 off.. but i donâ€™t regret it one bit.",i tell myself â€œfuture proofâ€ ðÿ˜,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
of course it depends on your needs.,but generally speaking; get the i7.,better value for money.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on the i9 and i7 in question and what you're gonna be doing with them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there'll be no discernible between the two.,use the one you prefer aesthetically.,note that the m.2.,heatsink on this motherboard can be moved to the second slot (but the text will be upside down if that bothers you).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just use the m.2_1 and m.2_2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thereâ€™s really no reason â€œnotâ€ to use the cpu connected slot for your primary os drive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i noticed i could move the heatsink.,seemed odd they only give you one heatsink.,i didn't bother using it though.,i used the other 2 m.2 slots.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
actually the os is on the sata drive.,the sata ssd was a free upgrade when i configured the system.,and the performance specs seemed to be the same as the m.2 version.,the m.2 drive i have in there is basically a game drive.,the 2nd m.2 i just added.... not sure what i'll use that for.,it's only 500gb.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it can get very hot between the graphics card and the cpu heatsink.,my previous board only had m2 slot there and the ssd throttled itself around 80 c. i had to compress a movie and run a game at the same time to archive that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not sure why you'd say that.,"intel had 0% market share in discrete gpus, and gpus were beginning to be used in high performance computing, where intel made its bread and butter with xeon.",larrabee wasn't just a fun little side project; there were hundreds of people working on it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when he says 2005 he is right.,we really didn't see discrete gpu's being used in servers until 2008+.,"nvidia didn't even create cuda until june 2007 and opencl wasn't around until august 2009.

before these technologies using a gpu in a server for anything beyond video transcoding or remote graphics work was essentially unheard of.",larrabee was around in 2007 with a slated release for 2010 while offering performance comparable to 2006 midrange/high-end cards.,but i wouldn't say that larrabee was created to compete in server usage more so intel saw graphics accelerators as a market they could expand into and grow.,they saw the revenue that graphics manufacturers were generating and it had great synergy with their own products.,at the time intel was selling cpu's and chipsets together and was planning to cut out third parties from making chipsets for their processors (like the nvidia nforce).,by providing manufacturers a graphics option in addition to those two other components they could increase their unit revenue percentage.,i think had they known only a few years later that their own xeon microprocessors would be competing with graphics accelerators they wouldn't have cancelled the larrabee project when it came to gaming capability.,now to be clear they did still release the xeon phi range which was based on the earlier work they did for larrabee but it didn't become popular and intel clearly weren't interested in giving it the proper love and attention it needed to succeed in the market.,now that they're going full in on a proper graphics capable solution i think their chances in the market are much better.,"i'm fully expecting them to support standard compute api's as well, not just intel oneapi so they can leverage what developers already know about opencl, vulkan, metal, cuda etc",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for this.,"i built my first pc in 2001, it was an amd, but at the time only the most diehard computer people i knew thought amd might someday rival intel in terms of size, either in market share of any segment or in terms of market cap/revenue/whatever metric you choose.","the narrative that is held today that intc will soon be the bargain basement of the three big (intc, amd, nvda) in any segment you could pick outside of discrete gpu was completely alien in 2005.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you can run a cpu at 90c for a decade without causing issues.,"there's a reason why they thermal throttle at 100c, and don't even shutdown once that occurs.",these kinds of extremes have to be validated for warranty and sales reasons.,"it's the voltage that can degrade a cpu, but if you run it within realms of reason, you might lose 50mhz over a decade or require a higher voltage to maintain old frequencies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there's incentive for them to say it though.,shitty box coolers and shorter cpu lifespan.,but maybe it's a non issue when you dont run cpu at 90c for extended time or even if so.,someone's probably done the research before i'm just not bothered to go searching lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the airflow?,regardless the cooling is still ok on the non airflow version afaik.,maybe the stock voltages are really high on that board or you're aio just isn't too performant for this hot cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can try this.,msi motherboard employee (he is from taiwan) explaining the secret of motherboard bios and how intel svid operates.,"* here he is rocking normal stock settings hitting 210 watt on p95 - [https://youtu.be/qaxss\_u0hhi?t=285](https://youtu.be/qaxss_u0hhi?t=285)

* after changing lite load to mode 4 he is back in windows running p95.","his system now sees 147 watts - [https://youtu.be/qaxss\_u0hhi?t=471](https://youtu.be/qaxss_u0hhi?t=471)

a few seconds later the system crashes because he went too low.",1.1 volts.,he ups the lite load to mode 5 and runs the test again and the system is now stable.,so what the above demonstrates is that this is a known feature and is how intel's svid is able to determine what voltage and current to apply to the cpu at which frequency and under load.,it is automatic and built into the system.,"because our cpu's frequency versus voltage is nonlinear, there needs to be some values that help the cpu determine which voltages work at higher and higher frequency.","for an asus motherboard, asus is a bit simpler.",they have the following modes to choose from.,i have also included my own test results in the imgur link below.,you can also see from the v/f scan curve (intel xtu scan) that the v/f curve is non-linear.,"and requires greater and greater voltage to maintain high frequency

* for asus svid best case is 0.01mohm
* typical case is 0.60mohm
* worst case is 0.90mohm
* intel fail safe is 1.10mohm
* [https://imgur.com/a/mvykfej](https://imgur.com/a/mvykfej) \- you can observe i change ac & dc ll from 0.30 to 0.90 mohm and observe the cinebench r23 scores along with temps and voltages etc...

the lite load setting for asus motherboards are ac load line and dc load line values.",you can locate them here in your bios.,"[https://www.techpowerup.com/review/asus-rog-strix-z590-i-gaming-wifi/images/bios\_25-copy.jpg](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/asus-rog-strix-z590-i-gaming-wifi/images/bios_25-copy.jpg)

i recommend set both ac & dc ll to 0.60 mohm and then 0.50 mohm.","leave your voltage setting to auto, leave load line calibration to auto or level 4. and only set your xmp memory timings.",you can set the overclocking multiplier to 50x or whatever you desire or leave on automatic.,this should lower your power consumption and temps and voltages while maintaining the same performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i feel like you'd be right to an extent but the cpu only hits these temps at cinebench runs anyways.,"for reference, i had a laptop that had so little cooling it constantly ran at 96-100c for 6 straight years and the cpu just doesn't work anymore, random shutdowns and bsods.",but that's like 17-19 hours a day constantly at 90+c.,"(i tried repasting and everything, but in the end you can only do so much with a laptop where the cooling system is so bad it may as well be passive + pushing it really hard all the time because you are addicted to computers / rendering / etc.",but it did hit 90c just by playing minecraft so...).,what i'm saying here is that this is the kind of bs that would break a cpu at such temps but if it hits 90c now and then it's not important.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i figured it out!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
regardless i think it'd show running at 100c isn't very safe tho.,"well, in this kinda extreme situation

i already tried swapping the ram, ssd, battery, repasting cpu, etc so i don't know what it could be other than cpu/mobo anyways.",or maybe it was a shit bin anyways--even when the laptop was new i couldn't even undervolt it much without causing bsod's so from there even a little degredation would cause issues,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ikr, when i saw that i was stranged out too, i am guessing it's just the temperature of my room which is also heating it up a lot (i know that's a shitty guess but i don't see anything else affecting the temps like that)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, this is normal.",the cpu will change its clock speed frequently based on its workload.,"if there is a small workload, it will turn down its clockspeed.","if there is a big workload, it will raise its clockspeed to finish its workload more quickly.","i also noticed that according to afterburner, your cpu recorded a max temperature of 81â°c.",i would monitor your cpu temps under heavy load just to make sure it doesn't stay around 80â°c to prevent damage to it.,"obviously, the cooler your cpu, the better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't see anything out of the ordinary.,what should i be looking at?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you shouldnâ€™t worry about the clockspeed, it can skyrocket by just opening an app or something.",same thing with utilization.,what you donâ€™t want to see constantly spiking are your power consumption and temperature.,(by spiking i mean above something like 80c and 100w when not heavily using your cpu.),those would be an indication of something taking up the resources of your pc in the background like unwanted apps or some task just failing and causing a lot of errors.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, but the thing is i have seen the graph look like that even when msi is the only thing running, so i was wondering.","but you say it's okay, right?","oh and the temps are usually around the 24-ish, it looks like that because i was doing some stress testing last night.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my cpu gets up to 90â° c in a heavy workload ðÿ˜‚,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my best guess would be that since there's a low clock speed at the end of the clock speed graph, it's very likely afterburner was recording your clock speeds during your stress tests before only afterburner was running and it saved the data.",afterburner also recording a max temperature of 81â°c would also help prove my claim that it was probably recording that data and saved it during your stress test(s).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"okay i see what you are saying, however that stress test was last night, and i have seen that graph look like that even before the tests, it has been like that since i got it, just around two weeks ago.","i was having some issues at first and i believe that may have been due to my usage of driver booster (for which i have learned my lesson already)  


i updated the bios last night too because the update apparently fixed issues with non k cpus and well i have not been having freezes and all the other stuff i was having before but for some reason i can't ignore the itch seeing that graph gives me.","some other guy told me it was just msi not being able to correctly read my cpu due to its architecture or something like that (i understand that this 12th gens are somehow different)   


so, yeah.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cpus increase and decrease their clock speeds on the fly and will bounce all over the place outside of being at max load.,they're capable of changing clock speed in milliseconds if not faster.,that is an overall average number that's being provided by msi afterburner.,if you want individual core clock speeds then get something like hwinfo64.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"okay, may i assume that this is normal behavior, then?",i just want to make sure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you very much.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what wattage is your cpu drawing?,thereâ€™s been various posts and reviews stating that you should never let the 12900k reach its maximum pl2 of 241w.,"hereâ€™s just one of the many reviews that shows the 12900k achieves 97.9% performance when power limited to 190w: https://www.techpowerup.com/review/intel-core-i9-12900k-alder-lake-tested-at-various-power-limits/single-page.html#test-setup

thatâ€™s 97.9% performance for 21.16% less wattage which is a huge improvement for the nh-d15 to cool.","you can do the research for yourself, but similar articles have claimed the same thing in terms of limiting the pl2 for a negligible decrease in performance.",and you will never notice that fps difference in gaming.,"see what wattage that beast of a cpu is pulling, then try limiting it 170-190 w and see if your thermals improve drastically.","also, do a before & after benchmark to compare the performance difference",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
from high 80s to mid 80s at the same settings - sounds like ambients.,is your room cooler in the morning?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
air cooling a 12900k eh?,sounds like a not so fun recipe for throttling unfortunately.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so, i got home for work and the system handled the 18ish hour stress test in prime95 quite well.","i started it over, because in my experience the first 30ish minutes is the most thermally taxing.",it is doing crazy good with the hottest core averaging 74 degrees.,so i'm not sure what happened to be quite honest,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you!!,"i'm currently at work, but off top i remember its being in the mid-200's (240-250 range)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nah, it is a temperature controlled environment.",edit: so maybe a fluctuation of 1 degree f in the room.,"if one degree fahrenheit drops the temps of my cpu by 3-7ish degrees, imma about to make it way cooler in that room lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea lol.,"i got stuff for a custom waterloop comin eventually, but thats a ways out",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, thatâ€™s definitely way too much for the nh-d15.",i speculate that 190w pl2 would get you down to 60-70 degrees celsius.,i would only suggest unleashing the full 241+ w pl2 when you have a proper loop setup that can dissipate that much energy.,an aioâ€™s radiator would become too saturated with heat over a longer period and eventually thermal throttle; a tower cooler wouldnâ€™t be able to dissipate that much heat through its fins and would thermal throttle as well (your situation).,"like i said before, just do performance tests before & after a pl2 power limit to see if you lose a negligible  amount of performance (1-5%) for a immense decrease in temperature.",good luck buddy!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nonsense, my u12a easily handles the 12900k at stock.","even overclocked its fine, im running 5.6 st and 5.2ghz all core.",sure it hits 90 at 5.2 ghz but every cooled pretty much does at that point,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

a 100 mhz overclock on a coffee lake processor with no hyperthreading is such a small increase in power consumption that i would not be concerned.,at worst you might get some vrm throttling in synthetic tests like prime95 but i really doubt you stress the vrm much in real loads even if its terrible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

depends if your motherboard have support for adaptive voltage.,offset works too.,i wouldn't worry about the cpu running at a fixed 24/7 without changing any other settings the power draw during idle is more or less the same as a cpu running at 0.8v idle.,i been running mine at 1.3v fixed for the last two years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"think of llc as a constant, offset is more a variable and granular.",llc is power to the core voltage and offset is for core voltage.,my bios version does not like the offset settings.,so i have not been able to test it out.,but it looks to be an adaptive voltage with a negative offset.,"i did test adaptive voltage and the vcore fluctuates depending on cpu load and cores used, it runs hot with idle vcore at 1.35v dropping to 1.25v running cinebench.",with negative offset you would be able to reduce the max adaptive voltage.,also the windows power plans; balanced and ultra performance have an effect on power draw and both have different heat profiles with an affect on performance also.,try the balanced profile along with your oc bios settings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no i haven't,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is the highest temp you got at fixed 1.3 v ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you will need to find out the what is the auto voltage under load.,then set a negative offset.,example if you see 1.3v while cinebench r23 is running then you will want to set an negative offset of 0.15 to get 1.15v under load.,be careful with going too much on the negative offset value as it affect both idle and under load voltage.,"idle 0.8v
after applying offset in this case 0.65v if idle voltage are too low you may experience instability when your pc is not doing anything",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"options in the msi bios are adaptive, adaptive+offset and advanced offset.",the advanced offset could be a separate voltage offset just applied to your set vcore.,check out the link it covers what we have been discussing.,"""with the â€œ-â€œ, (negative) voltage range selected, the voltage you select will be subtracted from the load voltage we saw in the operating system.","for example if our full load voltage was 1.376v in the operating system, and weâ€™d like it to be 1.32v instead, we simply set 0.05v as

"it can increase the single core performance, but it depends on the workload",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not to discredit anyone's great analogies, but intel originally said single-threaded performance should decrease with hyperthreading when it was introduced.",it was their reason to leave it disabled by default at the time.,and intel still recommends disabling ht for certain workloads like [tensorflow](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/maximize-tensorflow-performance-on-cpu-considerations-and-recommendations-for-inference.html).,but why wouldn't you see an increase in performance when disabled?,"my speculation: the os, kernel, applications all are optimized for hyperthreading now.","20 years after its introduction, it's baked into just about every part of the software and disabling it no longer makes any sense because of this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because the os tries its best to not schedule another thread on the same core unless it has no choice.,"if you open task manager, you'll see that for most low threaded workloads, only every other logical core is loaded.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ht never was the full effect of another core.,i believe the extra thread really only allows ~15-20% of the performance of another core.,it is why the i7 8700 with 6c/12t loses to 8c/8t 9700 in some cases.,the extra threads really only give the 8700 the throughput of approximately a 7 physical core cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i believe turning off ht might give you more overclocking headroom per core but single thread performance shouldn't change depending on if you have 1 thread or 2 threads per core.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ht is a workaround for instruction queue stalls.,"it gives a bit more power if processing two threads, but none if only one thread is running.background:long time ago cpus and memory were working at the same speed.",this meant cpu could fetch instructions one by one from memory in realtime.,"then cpus were speeding up, while memory was growing in size and speeding up.",this created a problem: static ram (sram) was getting exponentially expensive (in terms of silicon space and power consumption).,that's why dynamic ram (dram) was created.,"it is cheap to make, power efficient, but quite slow for modern cpus.",this means cpu has to use intermediate buffers called caches (made of small chunks of sram) where big chunks of program is loaded into and read from by cpu core.,"the issue is, if next instruction is not in cache, it needs to be fetched from dram and this is quite time consuming.",this process is called cache miss.,"the cpu could just stop doing anything until next instruction is loaded, or os is loading a different execution thread and hope it runs ok. this takes time and nothing is computed at that point.","to prevent these cpu stalls and aid in processing, cpu cores were added a queue, where instructions are loaded in an order they are most likely to be executed.","this loading is done by branch prediction module, which (in a very complicated way) analyzes the program and resolves possible branches.","if it assumes that an instruction jump is going to land outside what is already loaded in cache, it will fetch next program chunk from dram into cache and fix the queue.","but this prediction is just that, a statistical guess which may still fail, again creating cpu stalls, queue purgings and cache reloads.","so to minimize the impact, cpu cores were added a second instruction queue where a second thread of execution is loaded.",now we have one core and two queues as its inputs.,"now when one queue is stalled, instead of just idly waiting for queue and cache reload, cpu just switches to the second queue and executes a program there.",meanwhile the stalled queue is emptied and reloaded with another instruction flow.,that's why there is generally no gain in performance when switching ht off.,"this is the same cpu core that was executing one thread at a time, but now idle time is not wasted.",ht enabled may create issues for some workflows.,"this is due to the fact that there is the same amount of processing cores whether ht is enabled or disabled, but more threads are loaded into the cpu.","all threads rely on cache, which is quite small, and can only hold a bit of program, so it may create collisions when one thread loads its data and has to unload some other's thread data, making that one stall.",basically threads are fighting for cache.,"the other is too much dependency between them, when one running thread has to wait for some data, but that data is going to be processed by a thread that is inactive on some other core.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the virtual core uses only resources that are left over from the main core.,"so disabling ht won't make the main core faster, it will still use the same resources, the left overs are just idle now.",however there is a difference in multithreaded performance.,"when you have an application that requires 8 parallel threads and you got a cpu with 8 cores, 16 threads, then a ""bad"" scheduler (scheduling workloads to cores is not easy, so it's not like the scheduler has been made intentionally bad) might make the threads run on 4 physical, 4 virtual cores.",each thread could have their own physical core but instead two have been loaded into 1 core and have to compete for resources.,this will reduce performance.,disabling ht will make the application run faster in this scenario.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i recently cinebench tested ht on vs off on my 12700k and the single core performance was less than 1% difference but the multi-core score was a whopping 22% less with ht off.,"however without ht, the cpu package temperature was 17% less (78c vs 65c) and cpu package power 20% less (200w vs 161w) during multicore testing.","on a per watt basis the score was only 2% less than having ht on so if you're predominantly running single or light threaded workloads and looking to reduce power and heat, disabling ht is a quick win.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the way you're thinking of it is ""splitting the core in half"" while in reality it's still a single core, it's just allowing extra processes to be done on the same core as long as it isn't maxed out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol i wasn't expecting such a well done analogy like this.,thx man.,"it's a shame that  i can't give some extra mhz of cocaine to my i5, it's a non-k model xd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i didn't test it in normal use, but in the benchmarks the score was the same.",that's why i was curious.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think the reason could be that ht tries to push additional instructions from different task whenever there is a pause in the main task, thats what i read about this system.",so when you are doing a benchmark and nothing else the benchmark uses everything they can and ht does not interfere in single core.,"if there would be just one core and ht and you would do benchmark and something else at the same time cpu would try to do both thing at the same time, decreasing the score.","i dont have time and resources to test that but in cfd calculation this is a reason why ht should be turned off - it does not add performance but complicates things, when threads from the same program are ""fighting"" for the same core.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have an example of this at home, two i3, one 2/4 and an older 4/4, the 2/4 is way below the 4/4 on the benchmark score.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wow man you answered questions that i hadn't even thought to ask someone, what an amazing content.","i've always seen ht as extra cores, now i fully understand what it's all about.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it makes sense.,i already suspected that because with ht on and having twice as many cores it doesn't have twice the performance compared to ht off.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the effect is the same.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you're testing on a single threaded benchmark then on/off makes no difference.,"you only have one thread running so it doesn't matter if ht is there, you aren't using it either way.",if you test with two threads loaded and look at the performance of one thread individually you should find that it gets slower.,two of them sharing a core might only run at 70% of their speed when not sharing (but since now two are running your net performance is 2*70=140%).,"this is for exactly the reason you assumed above, that core doesn't get access to the full cpu all of the time since it is sharing resources.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if the software is very outdated and handles scheduling itself, it may mistakenly view ht as full cores and leave other cores idle instead of spreading out work per core.","ht can also cause slowdowns if the software is more cache limited than throughput limited, since cache ends up shared between 2 threads instead of 1. 

for the majority of consumer software these things are no longer problems since hyperthreads can use the resources of the other thread on the same core when that thread isn't being utilized.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

never over 150 watts.,maybe my chip is goated ?,that wattage is crazy high for a 12700kf on air.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seems like more people with aios are seeing worse temps than air coolers.,iâ€™ve heard theories that aios have a flatter heat sink that doesnâ€™t cover the die as well as an air cooler which typically a more curved surface area.,idk thatâ€™s 100% true but i rarely see anyone on 12th gen with a good quality air cooler like a d15 or u12a report bad temps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on the manufacturer.,also i doubt air coolers get better temps in full load benchmarks like cb23 or p95.,most seem to limit their power.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s true,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ve seen some posts where a d15 or u12a under load during cinebench barely broke 78c.,i have a u12a but i game on my pc and couldnâ€™t care less about cinebench or whatever else people like to run.,if youâ€™re into rendering i could see it.,the facts are that air coolers sometimes outperform aios or at the very least are on par with them save for the ones with huge rads.,thereâ€™s been enough testing by jtc and gn that show aios arenâ€™t the only way to get good temps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no way you're cooling a stock 12900k in cinebench that well.,just no way.,"12700k would be hard to believe, 12600k maybe.","besides, the d15 offers aio-cooling so no big surprise it achieves good results.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"but again, if
youâ€™re a gamer who cares about cinebench?",if youâ€™re a developer or you do a lot of rendering then sure.,99% of people that test using cinebench only do it to get a good score on the board.,thatâ€™s it.,it puts your system under a load it will never seen in gaming scenarios.,for gaming a d15 or a u12a on a 12900k works well.,for useless benchmarks?,maybe maybe not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

did you manage to find more information on maximum core frequencies per number of active cores for the non-k 12700?,"1 core has to be 4.9 ghz and 8 cores probably 4.5 ghz, but what about the rest?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
performance cores 4.8ghz and e cores 3.6ghz according to ark.,for the 12700k it say 4.9 and 3.8ghz respectively,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yep, that was the 4.5 gigahertz i found.",adored tv is a relatively reputable source so that's the one i believe the most.,it also sounds the most plausible.,that's probably the real number.,i couldn't find a good source on the 12700k either but a bunch of users that had it were reporting 4.7ghz and that matches what's reported in that article.,in the past wikichip would have a breakdown of what the frequency would be based on the number of cores in use which was awesome information.,you can still manually test for that and i wish that information was still there.,"i guess i would prefer if they showed the frequency at load 
and discuss the testing procedure, like i've seen in the past in some reviews rather than just saying here's what it is, because then you have to trust that they did the test properly but it's hopefully correct.","anyway, i appreciate the link :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thank you, this is very good relevant information.",what tower cooler you use for reference?,i have a noctua nh d15s since they provide lifetime free bracket upgrades for a new mounting as necessary.,edit: i see the intel list the maximum turbo wattage at 190 in the spec.,they list the tdp spec separately now.,they didn't used to do this and i didn't realize this had changed.,it's weird that your cinebench score went up at the same frequency.,maybe a difference with the e-cores?,if it's feeding it at the same constant frequency for the whole time i would assume that the score should be the same.,that adored tv review mentions the k ver being +200mhz faster and other users have reported hitting 4.7ghz.,wondering if you lost the silicon lottery and this is why intel doesnâ€™t release max turbo specs anymore.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

too bad.,"my i7-12700k has the following active core ratios by default:

- p: 50x (1c), 49x (2-4c), 48x (5-6c), 47x (7-8c)
- e: 38x (1-2c), 36x (3-4c)

dude... it's written max turbo 5ghz.,and then max p core turbo 4.9ghz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
where did you find a source on the 4.5?,"i'm not saying you're wrong, because that's definitely what your cpu is doing i'm just curious if that's expected standard behavior across the board.",it definitely contradicts what adored tv had to say but it's such a shit show to get information on these things.,tech power up said that the stock pl2 should be 150 watts which makes no sense to me because intel lists in the spec sheet on ark 190 watt max turbo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you go to intel ark and you click the question mark beside the turbo frequency to get an explanation for what it means and it tells you this: â€œmax turbo frequency is the maximum single-core frequency.,"â€

i don't want to know the maximum single core frequency, i want to know the maximum frequency on all the cores when it boosts.",intel used to list this information up until the 8th generation.,i think it's insane how hard it is to find and professional reviews and it tells me that even the â€œprofessionalsâ€ really don't know what they're doing when they test cpus in benchmarks if they donâ€™t verify the frequency.,that's why we've had issues where cpus where mce  was on because said reviewers are careless and clueless.,it's really easy to test this for anyone that actually owns the cpu.,"as long as you have a motherboard that supports disabling the power limits, do that, load up prime 95, make sure that the frequencies don't drop and then keep track of what the maximum frequency is on all the cores.",boom you now know what the maximum all core turbo is.,not very difficult.,if anyone's willing to do that that owns a 12700f that will give me the information i want.,or if any actual professional reviewer has done that again it answers my question.,"unfortunately, i don't think anyone's going to give me that information and i'm just going to spend the extra money on a 12700k because intel has decided to make this a black box.",i would assume the 12700 is the same as a 12700f but i canâ€™t even be 100% sure of that.,randomly looking on the internet one guy on reddit said 4.2 woth no source.,one website said 4.5 with no benchmarks.,and one cpu site said 4.0 with no proof.,"the 12700 isnâ€™t even listed as 5ghz on ark, thatâ€™s the 12700k.",you couldnâ€™t even bother to go to ark before giving me useless incorrect information.,stop trying to help people when have no idea what you're talking about and put zero effort in.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

oh... i did go to ark and i did check the 12700k and mention it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's confusing as shit because until publishes 190 watts as the max turbo but then the mobos are spec at 150 pl1 and 2?,i don't even know.,"but on the topic of motherboard manufacturers not making sense, tons of vendors weren't respecting intels power limits in the first place which is why they decided to say fuck it and just set both power limits the same.",i strongly disagree with the fact that mce and auto voltage were set to on as default and some other board manufacturers had the implementation so broken it was straight up frying people's chips.,would be funny if it wasn't so shitty.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i addressed in my opening post how intel ark would not answer the question, so it's especially frustrating when that's the response i get, about a different cpu no less.","the topic title was about the 12700f, not the 12700k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

clock speed is a very basic metric.,everything that happens in one cycle can determine the impact of that clock speed (and why slower clocks may mean better performance on newer generations!).,"bigger cache, more specialized units, better branch prediction, etc...

think of it as an actual wall clock - you have one clock that rotates pretty fast but only has 4 numbers and one hand.","the second clock has 12 numbers on it and three hands, but runs 10% slower overall.","every time a hand passes a number on either clock, work gets done.",which one's going to be better?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
instructions per clock,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, instructions per clock.","it's why amds fx series cpus back in the early 2010s were such terrible cpus even tho they could easily be overclocked to 4.5 or 5ghz on air, because the instructions per clock were abysmally bad.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ipc is the main improvement.,stands for instructions per clock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not 100% sure, but sometimes it's from 'enlarging the core' so more work could be done in one cycle (i think rocket lake vs skylake is sort of like this despite the architecture change?)",it may also come from an added instruction set like avx,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>is there other feature or changes in cpu that does provide additional speed and performance??,what are they??,"the cpu core consists internally of many functional blocks that make execution of instructions happen and with every cpu generation there are some small tweaks to that, and every few years there larger changes in the internal architecture.","for more details see for example the block diagram of one core at:

"this is one of the things that i've checked as well, i do have another 360mm aio in my system which is for my gpu.","if i hold the  tubes on the gpu aio which is a alphacool eiswolf 2, i can feel the water running through the tubing and i can feel it easily and i believe this is because it's running at 2400-2600 at all times.","when i hold the tubing on the freezer ii, it doesn't feel anywhere near as powerful, not by a long shot despite me putting it as 100% via the motherboard via: pwm and because there is no real reason to determine what the pump is running at (from a rpm point of view) it's really hard to determine if the pump is faulty.","with my older 10850k, i always ran that at 4.9ghz all core /w a -0.050v offset.","when i try and do that on my current cpu and motherboard combo, the system just doesn't boot, but that is something i can try and resolve.",i'll just have to do a bit more research.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you've completely misunderstood and it's to be expected.,my motherboard supports both lga1200 and lga1700 cooler installations.,i don't mean to be rude but please read up on my motherboard before commenting because at this point it just makes you look ignorant.,"i also wont be doing any washer mods, i shouldn't have to ""mod"" my cooler installation for x and y results when an older cooler worked perfectly fine, maybe i should have been more clear.","i also installed my corsair h150i using that lga1200 bracket and that was more than perfect without any issues, so how do you explain that one roy?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

well my post was to show that something is obviously wrong with your new cooler if iâ€™m on air and getting better temps than you.,i mean you pretty much diagnosed your problem in your post.,new cooler underperforming compared to your old one.,waiting on your new bracket to see if that fixes it.,what exactly were expecting anyone to say?,youâ€™ve thought of everything yourself.,one thing i will say and that iâ€™ve noticed is that for 12th gen intel the people that are having the most issues seemingly are using aios.,some say the thatâ€™s because the cpu has a slight bend and doesnâ€™t play nice with a flatter heatsink that aios typically have.,air coolers apparently have a slightly curved heatsink that negates the curve in the cpu so temps are sometimes better than aios.,take that for what itâ€™s worth.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

unless you are having like multiple streams while gaming or edit 6k videos the i5 12400 is more than sufficient!,gaming wise the i5 12400 is going to last at least another 1-2 console generations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

for gaming and future proofing my system for the next few years,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you're pure gaming the 12400 (6 cores) is basically fine but if you do any or plan to do productivity stuff the 12600k(6 high performance + 4efficiency cores) is the choice.,it beats the 10900k's 10 cores across the board.,even if you don't overclock the uplift is good to have it you want longevity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then get the 12600k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"forget about ""future proofing"" the next few upcoming cpus will see huge performance uplifts and the roadmaps for both amd and intel prove that.",buy the 12400f since it's a better value and save up for a future upgrade 2-3 years from now.,not worth paying 50% more for 5-20% more performance in games that you will only see if you have a fast enough gpu.,consider the fact that the 12400f is as fast as an i9 11900k and 3700x/5600x.,people bought those two processors with future proofing in mind too.,it's not working out very well though.,raptor lake and zen 4 both look very **very** impressive.,even if you got a 12700k it would look slow.,don't drink the kool aid.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what kind of productivity stuff are you talking about?,i never understood what other kind of things would stress a cpu besides gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you record your gameplay, stream, edit videos or photos, rendering, cad software.",stuff like that.,gaming mostly stresses the gpu unless youâ€™re doing high fps gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most other things stress the cpu more than gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

but do you think the 12400 would be good enough for streaming on twich plus gaming only?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you're going to be streaming i would get the 12600. last thing you're going to want to do is limit yourself right off the bat.,games now days can utilize more cores than previous some will still only use 4 but many will use 6 or more cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i forgot to say i only play esports title games so no aaa games.,should i still go for the 600k?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
either one will work.,the 12600k will be more future proof as it has 4 extra cores that could be utilized.,while the 12400 will always be limited to 6 cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel sayed that 1.45v would not be a problem for these chips.,"&#x200b;

been there with my dark rock 4.,"""undervolting"" is the magic word.",try setting 1.250v with a negative offset (i have -0.15) and you will be way under 80 c without losing noticable power.,my 12700kf is at 72 c on cb r23 with a score of around 22900 now.,idle is around 30c or less.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you have a good sample, overclocking can actually run cooler (i have a high end aio but currently in a bad air flow case).",i run all p cores at 5ghz and my e cores at 4ghz at 1.225v.,not sure if iâ€™ve gotten lucky with my chip.,but worth a try.,i use adaptive voltage + offset at -0.120 to achieve this with p states so the cpu down clocks and down volts at idle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my i9-12900k could undervolt even -0.12v - what reduced temps by almost 20\*c in cinebench 23 test... i could lower temps by almost 20\*c to be on stock or leave vcore and add +200mhz everywhere.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"contact seems good compared to some bent 12700k i've seen, mine included.",probably you are running power configuration well over the capabilities of the cooler.,"pl2 unlimited is the usual setting for motherboards in their stock configuration, that alongside higher voltage than needed, which is the usual stock setting for motherboards also, will do a number on any cooler.",that cooler may probably not be able to cool the 200w+ cb might be pulling.,"a tweaked 12700k with the right voltages will only need 160-170w in their stock clocks for cb, as oposed to the freeforall config mobos come with, and that's the main cause for ""overheating"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"even though a 10900k is more than adequate for most use-cases (i currently use one but with a z490 board, never saw the reason to go z590, i don't plan on going 11th gen) i'd say splurg a little more and just get something current like the 12600k.",way better performer than the 10900k at whatever configuration.,"still, i plan on keeping my 10900k till probably 15th or 16th gen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it sounds as if you already understand that performance will be better on the 12600k and there is an upgrade path available.,because it is newer and on a better process node.,but it also sounds like cost is a factor and the 10900k is a better deal.,"both will get you the performance you want, high fps.",so you just need some more data to help justify the i9 10900k over the i5 12600k.,a few things for the i9 10900k.,it is the more mature overclocking platform.,you get some fun oc features to help you extract more performance.,example 10900k features turbo boost 2.0 (all core turbo) and turbo boost 3.0 (high single core turbo) and it also features thermal velocity boosting.,"tvb will boost if your load and your cooling setup can keep the temperatures below 70c (during gaming or wahtever) if you can keep it below that temp, 10900k will boost another 100 mhz.",this is on top of whatever manual overclock you dial in as well.,from my understanding 12th gen and 12600k only has turbo boost 2.0 (all core turbo) and p-core and e-core overclocking.,it also has thread director for windows 11. that could be important later as msft releases more and more future updates.,intel i9 are usually better binned chips than intel i5 line of cpu.,"this is due to the higher ""stock"" specs out of the box.",you could get a lower binned i9 but it will still be better binned than an i5 from that generation.,but that still does not beat the newer process node and architectural changes for 12th gen intel.,intel 10th also features intel cryo cooling (tec cooling) if you are into sub-zero daily usage.,the cost is quite high but it is comparable to a custom water loop setup.,and wattage is also a concern..... haha but 10th gen does offer sub-zero consumer ready stuff!,might not be a match for every pc gamer.,but it might be for some!,12th gen hasn't got this yet\*\*\*\* but may in the future.,"=)

i see that you already found the xmp settings.",i just found it a bit funny that you were claiming that the motherboard is confused about memory timings and in tittle of the post you claimed that the cpu is confused about the timings :-d ... many of us have been there being ourselves confused about some parts of computer technology.,anyhow to your question about which profile to use.,that is up to your needs.,"most likely you want the fastest mhz speed profile on ddr4, but for some applications and motherboards people choose a lower speed and tighter timings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

manual overclocking is a good option in case xmp isn't stable.,in that case you can set the timings high and slowly decrease them until you get instability.,you want to prioritize getting cas as low as possible before the others.,"i recommend verifying with the hammer test in memtest86; if you can pass that you're pretty much guaranteed good, but on your first go you want to run all tests a couple times.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i believe for corsair xmp 1 leaves some of the timings and configurations on ""auto"" which allows you motherboard to optimise these settings, typically this will be more agressive than corsairs verified xmp settings.",xmp 2 hard codes all these values and is usually more stable.,both will run at 3200mhz.,in the real world i don't think anyone would be able to tell the difference between the two.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'm required to disclose i am an intel employee when talking about intel on social media.,"however, i'm not on the windows team.",tldr: it is very likely because your monitor is 4k60 hdr and the dock documentation meant 4k60 sdr.,long version: tbt4 supports 2 dp links up to hbr3 (25.92 gbit/s) each (but within tbt's total 40gbit/s limitation so it can't actually do 2 hbr3 links).,"your dock very likely hard splits these 2 dp links so that one link serves the downstream facing tbt port (dfp), while the other link serves an mst hub that splits the link into 2xdp and hdmi ports.","this means that by plugging into the dock's dp ports only, both monitors have to share a single hbr3 link (25.92 gbit/s).","since your monitors are 4k60 hdr, each need 15.68 gbit/s.","if they were 4k60 sdr, each would need 12.54 gbit/s, which just barely fits in to hbr3 after mst overhead.",hdr takes \~25% more bw than sdr because of hdr's 10 bits per color vs sdr's 8 bits per color.,"possible solutions:   
1. try disabling hdr--there may be a method to do this in the monitor's osd menu.",disabling hdr within windows may or may not work...i have no clue how windows + intel's windows display driver handles mst bw allocation.,"2. you don't need a tbt-dp adapter, a typec-dp (dp-alt) adapter should suffice.","you will probably have to plug one of the monitors directly into the laptop, which unfortunately defeats the purpose of the dock.","you can try plugging one of the monitors into the dock's dfp, but i have seen docks behave poorly in negotiating bw.",basically it requests hbr3 for the mst hub even if the displays behind the hub don't need hbr3.,40-25.92=14.08 gbit/s remaining isn't enough for any dp link to drive 4k60 hdr.,"its worth a try if you already have the dp-alt adapter (or bought it to try plugging directly into the laptop), but i wouldn't count on it.","plugging in the dp port last (after plugging the other monitor into dock's dfp and the dock into the laptop) might work, but again i'm not sure how windows + intel's windows display driver + intel's windows thunderbolt driver handles this.",3. an older 1st gen tbt3 dock may help you here.,the ability for tbt3 to do hbr3 didn't come until 2nd (ish?),"gen tbt3 controllers, so 1st gen tbt3 docks can only do 2xhbr2 (2\*17.28 gbit/s=34.56 gbit/s).",this fits within tbt3 bw and each link has enough bw to run your 4k60 hdr monitors.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"xe can handle multiple 4k outputs, have you tried using both thunderbolt 4 ports on your laptop to power the monitors instead of going through a dock?","obviously not the long term solution, but when issues like this come up its usually the dock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't know what kind of laptop you have but my 3 year old thinkpad has 2 type c connectors and an hdmi port.,i believe both type c connectors support thunderbolt.,one of the thunderbolt connectors goes to my dock but it is a different dock than the one you have.,my dock has 2 displayport connections which will support dual 1080p but ony a single 4k display.,"i can connect a second 4k display via hdmi or with this adapter to the other thunderbolt port

"while i have an xps 9310 and some 4k monitors, i don't have a tb4 dock or more than one thunderbolt to dp cable to test with, sorry.",as far as i can tell all the documentation shows you should be able to run both external displays at 4k60.,do you have anything else plugged into the dock besides the displays by chance?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
u/unix_su thank you!,ðÿ™ðÿ™ this is amazing feedback.,we may be close.,so this makes perfect sense.,"i did, however, notice that the hdr on these monitors is either so basic, or non-existent.","in windows, it shows 8bit on both monitors and sdr, and the hdr setting appears to be off.",i did mess around with turning it on for fun on the monitor but this had no impact.,i'm not following your second point.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea good point.,i don't however have a tb4 to dp cable or adapter...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good question.,"i do - i have one usb device (a blue snowball mic), and an ethernet connection.",do you think these are sharing the bandwidth?,"i unplugged everything else, but no change sadly :(",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your welcome.,i know that windows 10 support for hdr is poor.,what i'm not sure of is whether the driver + mst hub negotiates bw using monitors' max data rates even when you aren't maxing out the monitors.,"to expand on my 2nd point...there are 3 general categories of tc ports supporting display:

1. usb ports supporting up to usb3 speeds (not tbt) and display.","this uses dp-alt, which is the industry name for tc->dp (or hdmi, dvi, vga, etc) adapters.",luckily these are relatively inexpensive compared to the rest of your setup.,"2. thunderbolt-only ports, which are generally only found as dfp on monitors for daisy chaining to another tbt monitor.",this uses tbt tunneling for display.,3. thunderbolt ports that are backwards compatible with usb.,"this can either use tbt tunneling or dp-alt for display, depending on what is plugged in.","this is what is found your tbt laptop, and probably the dfp on your dock.","tbt tunneling and dp-alt are different protocols, but most tbt ports are #3, so a dp-alt adapter will work on most tc ports.","if you get a dp-alt adapter, you have 2 options:

1. plug one monitor into the dock, and other into the laptop.",this should work.,2. plug one monitor into the dp/hdmi port on dock and other into dfp port on dock.,"while this seems like it should work in theory, in practice it doesn't always work as expected.","1. while tbt3/4 supports a total of 40 gbit/s, it can't infinitely adjust how much is assigned to each function.","for display, the granularity is based on link rate (rbr, hbr, etc) and lane count (1, 2, or 4).",see table below.,2. your dock splits the 2 dp links into the dfp port and the mst hub that serves the dp/hdmi.,many docks in this configuration always requests 4 lanes of hbr3 for the mst hub even if the connected monitor(s) don't need it.,"seriously, even if you plug in a 1080p monitor, it will request 4xhbr3.","that causes 25.92 out of tbt's 40 gbit/s to be *reserved* for your 1st monitor, even though it doesn't need all of it.",3. the 40 - 25.92 = 14.08 gbit/s remaining.,this is not enough for your 2nd 4k60 hdr monitor.,"4. to avoid this, it may be possible to connect everything in a specific order:
      1. monitor 1 to dfp via dp-alt adapter
      2. dock to laptop
      3. monitor 2 to dp/hdmi
   5.","(#1 and #2 are interchangeable) the hope is by first reserving 4xhbr2 for monitor 1 via dfp, the mst hub will not be able to carve out 4xhbr3 for itself.","however, the os/driver may end up soft reconnecting every display when a new one is detected, so switching the order doesn't always help.","|dp link rate|dp lane count|effective data rate (gbit/s)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|rbr|1|1.296|
|rbr|2|2.592|
|rbr|4|5.184|
|hbr|1|2.16|
|hbr|2|4.32|

|hbr2|4|17.28|
|hbr3|1|6.495|
|hbr3|2|12.99|
|hbr3|4|25.92|

another point i forgot to mention...before trying to debug tbt make sure your dock is getting detected as tbt and not downgrading to usb.","many tbt devices including docks are backwards compatible to usb if plugged into a device that doesn't support tbt, but they are sometimes not detected properly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you again!,so you gave me an idea which might tell you more than it tells me.i went and grabbed an hdmi>tbt3 adapter as that's all i have.,"i plugged in the second monitor to hdmi, attached the adapter, and plugged in the tbt to the second tbt port on the laptop.","now i have 60hz on both monitors, but somewhat defeating the purpose of the dock.",does this conclusively tell us anything about what you are hypothesizing above?,"\***update**\*

i performed another test that occured to me.","i used the same hdmi with the tbt adapter attached, and ran that to the other thunderbolt port on the dock this time, and this also worked.","so i think you are right that there is something with the lanes being shared across the display port and hdmi ""channels"", but separate for these from the thunderbolt.","this is really odd to me, given the table on the lenovo site.","for clarity, what i'm observing is that the ports on the dock: dp1, dp2 and hdmi all seem to share bw, but the tb port seems to have its own share of bw.","so technically, the dock is working but not how i expected and not in line with their documentation...   
thoughts?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

great!",this result is as good as i imagined.,"the dock's dp and hdmi ports all share 1 dp link, which is limited to 4xhbr3 25.92 gbit/s.",this is not enough do drive 2x 4k60 hdr.,the dock's dfp tbt port has its own dedicated dp link.,"when the 2 separate dp links negotiate bw well, which in this case it did, you can maximize the display bw by utilizing both links.",i'm glad you didn't hit the corner case that i detailed above.,"when that happens, there is no way for a user to fix that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i have quite a few years of experience under my belt with system building, overclocking and just general useless pc knowledge.",i recently built 2 alder lake systems.,one using a 12400f and the other using a 12900k.,both systems have a vetroo v5 cooler (generic evo 212) and thermal grizzly thermal paste.,the 12400f was hitting around 70 to 75 with p95 and around 60 gaming.,the 12900k (stock speeds) was right at 15 to 20 degrees higher.,hitting around 85 c under p95 and about 70 to 75 gaming.,both chips show a quite a big difference in thermals after removing the stock intel mounting bracket and replacing it with the thermalrite mounting frame.,i think i paid like $7 bucks each for them.,"the main system we use the most, the 12400f even seen a fair drop in temp.",now it runs around 60 to 65 c under p95 and 55c while gaming!,almost a 10 c delta.,"most normal users who do not overclock and have ample airflow probably wont care, but overtime a difference in 10 to 15c is still going to make a difference in the lifespan of the chip, maybe you wont notice if you don't keep your cpu's for decades but i digress.","these brackets are not pointless and will for sure help out the overclocking scene but as for the whole ""12th gen bending"" i don't see it as such a big deal as most folks, yes the chip requires more thermal paste due to the huge gap once its clipped down, but its not like its going to cause damage or issues, its just going to run a bit hotter and as we all know, its not going to make much of a difference, heck even the 12900k don't seem to care and almost seems to run better when its smothered in heat and voltage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the problem with 12th gen is that it's rectangular, and the mounting kit pushes the longer sides of the cpu downwards so damn hard, so of course it will be bent.","note that lga2011 server cpus are also rectangular, except lga2011 pushes down on all 4 sides, so it won't cause a problem.","intel basically cheaps out on the mounting bracket and thinks it's going to be fine at least for 2-3 years, but it's hard to say how bad it will be for the long term.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
\^ this!,there are so many questions.,the concavity is clearly more than what is typically seen.,"&#x200b;

which coolers are best?",what other solutions can we use to solve this?,what about long-term issues of bending and thermal cycling?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you watch the video of the guy that created the mod, he says all cpus bend, some even worse, with lga1150 almost have a s shape bend.",it is just that certain coolers have a very flat block which can cause issues.,really just confirm the curve of your cooler to see.,it does suckâ€¦but we may see 1700 specific coolers come out soon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeh you've got the gold standard for efficient and cool cpus, so i think youre good either way, especially with a nice cooler such as the fuma",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not really.,look at the numbers of sold units and the posts reporting high temps.,"if every other post would say i got 90c in rdr2 with an aio ok, but if you try to cool your 12900k with a cheap air cooler, power limit off in cb23, you gonna have thermal throttling anyways.","got an nd-h15 on my 12700k with no problems, 80c in cb23 with a 0.015 offset undervolt",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezauy4as4li

"i would be interested for sure, if this was to ever get made.",it seems like a much better solution than the current system.,it doesn't seem like it would be too difficult to machine something like that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the links.,really interesting topic all around.,"from my limited research, haven't intel's heat spreaders always had this concavity issue?",isn't that why extreme overclockers in the past would sand the ihs around the edges to gain better thermal performance from their chips?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

heatsink mounts apply 30-40psi on the ihs.,it'll conform if you have a convex heatsink like almost everyone and screw it down enough.,even op's links says don't do the mod.,">the base plate of the cpu cooler is usually convex in the center, so some distortion can be covered, and if it is within that range, inserting a washer will have no effect.",it is a case by case basis whether inserting a washer will really reduce the temperature by around 5 degrees.,"also, there is no denying the possibility of unexpected problems regarding contact with the lga pins due to weakened retention.","to be honest, i personally do not recommend this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think that if that were the case, people who experienced the bending issue wouldn't be resorting to the washer mod",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think it's the socket rather than the cpu.,i've got 2 msi boards and neither are affected.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm aware of that explanation, but i'm not convinced.","if the ihs is bent so much that contact between cooler and cpu isn't optimal: 

1) what cooler do i buy *now*?","to me that's an issue

2) some people reported the washer mod improved their temps, presumably due to better ihs-cpu contact... then why don't motherboards come ""corrected"" by default?",wouldn't it be better than requiring a new generation of more convex coolers?,"3) do we know the long term effects of bending on this cpu, for this specific socket?","i very much need an upgrade, but i'll wait until more information is available about this topic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks man.,so far so goodðÿ¤ž,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yesterday played cyberpunk 2077 a bit and saw max temps between 50 to 55. didn't have a chance to test more in depth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i know this is later but what motherboard do you have?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, the ihs has always deformed somewhat during installation because of the mounting pressure.","the issue here is that it's happening in a more pronounced way due to excess pressure, and the elongated shape of 12th gen is making it worse.","there really should be support tabs around the entire ihs, not just two in the middle.",perhaps even moving the tabs to the shorter sides would have eliminated the problem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so it wont bend to a point of getting damaged?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>it'll conform if you have a convex heatsink like almost everyone and screw it down enough.,is there any evidence of this?,>even op's links says don't do the mod.,i guess that's because keeping the annoyance (e.g.,+5 c higher temps) would be better than potential risks from the mod.,i'd prefer having neither issue to be honest...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">washer mod

what does the washer mod do?",is it like spaces to fill up the gap?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sounds logical, but how tf they did that, some part of sockets is too small, or they are mounted incorrectly on motherboard?","i guess first option is more probable, but nobody knows that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which msi motherboards do you have?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all good questions.,it was his specific custom water cooler block.,my 1151 is going strong 8 years later and is one of the more odd bends/warps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i couldn't even get the thing to post.,"z690 msi wifi, 12700kf and a nzxt z72 with the 1700 bracket.",bent the top left corner of the substrate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have the msi mag z690 tomahawk wifi ddr4 gaming,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no one that i've seen says that this will cause damage to the cpu or the motherboard.,the concern is that the cooler doesn't completely contact the cpu integrated heat spreader surface so the temperatures are higher and cooling system is less effective.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it won't get damaged except that it probably will preserve that deformation for a long time and might be a problem if you change the cooler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm not really sure what the answer is either.,"intel didn't really test lga1700 thoroughly enough it seems, and now all of us adl owners are wondering what to do.","none of us want higher temps, or a bent cpu of course, but i'm very hesitant to mod a $250+ motherboard and potentially make things much worse.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
imo it's likely just tolerances.,"if the retention bracket is jsut *slightly* too low down at the clamp portion, or the socket itself is a little softer than it should be and has a little more flex in the middle, then the mounting pressure is wrong and the cpu flexes a little in the middle.",i think it would be interesting to get data on lotes vs foxconn supplied sockets and see if one or the other exhibits the problem more.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have an 12900k and boy does it run super toasty.,"i have tried, 240, 360 and air cooler to see which one is the best for it.",i end up settling to on the dh-15s.,seem like itâ€™s similar to the dh14 in performance.,just bear in mind i had to add a -.05v offset to reduce the power draw down significantly while giving up about 7% in performance.,"without undervolting, it does thermal throttle while running r23 cinebench.","with the undervolt it sits around 80-83c

i tested the 12900k on a prebuilt with a 240mm cooler master aio and i can say safely the performance is similar or worse then the noctua dh-15s

lastly, i did tested on a 360mm aio without any issues.","without undervolting, it does still hit close to 85c-90c under r23 cinebench.",i ended up choosing the air cooler since i donâ€™t want more points of failure but if you want unrestrained performance 280 and 360 might be the way to go.,also for the dh-14 i am not sure if the lga 1700 bracket kit is supported by it so you need to verify that.,also if you buy any asus z690 boards the regular dh-15 does not clear it without a 90 rotation.,or you can get the dh-15s like i did and you just need to swap the offset side towards the pci-e slot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™d go u12a or d15 for those two cpus.,hell iâ€™d probably got with a good aio for the 12900k over air if it was me.,i have a u12a on my 12700kf and it keeps the cpu nice and cool even when overclocked.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">i tested the 12900k on a prebuilt with a 240mm cooler master aio and i can say safely the performance is similar or worse then the noctua dh-15s

i think a lot of reviews have older 240mm aios only matching the nh-d15, nh-d15s performance whereas more modern ones by ek and lian-li can slightly outperform the nocuta aircoolers.","however, 280mm and above are usually where you want to go if you need to beat the nh-d15",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i upgraded my system this weekend.,"best buy had 2 z690 mobos- a asus for 450.00 (ddr5), and a msi pro z690-a for 220 (ddr4).","i wanted to avoid cheaping out and was ready to dump cash for the asus board, but there were no ddr5 ram sticks available.","now that i have the msi board up and running, i have to say it is a solid board, better than i thought it would be.","1 caveat: 

if you are going to do a fresh win11 install, get a usb to ethernet dongle.","apparently, win11 doesnt have drivers for the intel lan adapter so you cant get network connection/internet and therefore cant finish the install.","so either go to msi download, and grab intel lan drivers and save to usb stick, or connect via usb>ethernet adapter and do you install first then go update the driver from msi.","option 1 just requires that you have a working net connected pc, option 2 just requires the usb/ethernet adapter .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the asus matx ddr4 board.,it's the cheapest z690 and you can reuse your mounting hw.,board's great too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
msi pro z690-a ddr4 has what most users would need.,"solid vrm, 4 m.2 nvme slots, 2.5 intel nic.",plus its only $220 bucks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the scarcity of the ddr4 boards and getting a good deal on some ddr5 ram led me to pick up a z690 auros ultra d5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes i also recommend it.,checked many reviews and went with this one.,"it's bios is not as compact as asus, but it's ok everything is there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i was going for the tomahawk precisely, i just donna want get shafted because iâ€™m importing all my gear as out market is horrendous with 2 or 3 times msrp so i need to make sure :) i also do have a usb dac if the audio is crap",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i watched hardware unboxed video and all gbyte cards run much hotter than the msi cards but still within specs.,i think it was 44 vs 64 degrees celsius,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"great, thanks for the feedback and advice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tomahawk was quite appealing to me.,"i think the edge has very slight improvements in some areas that probably make it worth the cost increase if you need any of them, but if you donâ€™t, you probably wonâ€™t notice the difference.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i certainly didn't see that much difference with the boards i tested.,"depends on so many things though - bios version, cooler, ambient temps, but ultimately even 64'c is well away from thermally throttling the cpu.","yes they're cooler, but what do you actually gain by that?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but then you are already up 80usd/euros compared to the pro a. this is what i hate i always end up paying a lot by going after higher end stuff lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"less noise :) i hate noise iâ€™m very sensible to it , so fan ramp ups kill me",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for the 12700k youâ€™re probably fine with the z690-a.,for the 12900k i would probably feel more comfortable with the vrm on the tomahawk.,"although iâ€™m using a asus z690 hero myself, i had to buy a msi z690-a to get my ddr5, and i will be keeping and using the board in a lower end build.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"z690 has cpu overclocking, more lanes, etc.",both will work fine at stock with normal use but z690 has more premium features.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, the z690-a has a worse usb selection and audio codec, but it also has pcie 5.0, much better m.2 complement, and intel lan.","plus, if you need wifi thereâ€™s a version for $20 more with it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you brought a k processor which means you should go for the z690 board, the b660 one make no sense here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"got it bro, this decision was bit hard because i found that b660 has wifi and more usb ports.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> the z690-a has a worse usb selection and audio codec, but it also has pcie 5.0, much better m.2 complement, and intel lan.","plus, if you ne

thanks brother ill go for the z690 then :d",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can always have premium wifi card and extension for usb port man.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah my bad, newbie mistakes hahah",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just gaming?,don't bother.,$600 to get 10%~ more fps is not worth it.,is there a game that the 11900k can't handle?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"while people will point out that there is a performance difference, it is simply not worth it by most reasonable people's standards.","your 11900k is already plenty, so any gains to be had would be like asking a girl if she noticed the extra 2mm on your schlong.","technically, it's bigger, but who can tell without a ruler?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i was in the same boat.,i went 11900k to 12900k.,my little brother is getting my 11900k setup to pair with his 2080 super and my younger sister is getting his 9900k setup to pair with whatever gpu she manages to pull.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12700k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"people will tell you it's not worth it, and that would be true if you were simply throwing away the existing parts but if you're reselling the 11900k and z590 or whatever, you cancome out with a better cpu (12700k) for no additional money spent.",because the 11900k sells for $400+ used still..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
weâ€™ve heard rumors that 13th gen will be in the same socket as 12th gen but nothing confirmed.,it would be nice intel stopped making us upgrade motherboards all the time so i hope itâ€™s true.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you manage to resell it and buy new gen setup with no or little additional cost then yes.,"ultimately,
depends on how deep your pockets are.","some people are waiting 2 years for gpu, some just out right paid scalper prices and so on....",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes and no.,the upgrade from 11900k to 12700k will result in performance uplift.,will it be noticeable to you depends on where you game at.,if you game at 1080p to 1440p and at refresh rates 120fps to 240fps then yes you will need the newer cpu for those frames.,"if you game closer to 120fps, the 11900k is more than enough.","for overclocking, the i9 11900k will have more features.","i9 - 11900k can tvb to 5.3ghz, turbo3.0 to 5.2ghz, and turbo2.0 to 5.1ghz all stock.","i7 - 12700k can turbo3.0 to 5.0ghz, p-core turbo to 4.9ghz, and e-core turbo to 3.8ghz all stock.",so there are different feature sets for the overclocking with these chips.,"11th gen intel currently supports sub-zero intel cryo cooling while 12th gen does not yet\*\*\* =)

so if it is an overclocking/tweaking itch you need to full fill, the i9 will have more features.",and i9 is usually binned better than i7.,but of course 12th gen is on a better process node.,"intel 7 (3rd iteration of 10nm)

haha love the analogy!,made me laugh.,i appreciate it man.,only thing that drives me crazy with this 11900k is i 100 percent lost the silicon lottery with it unfortunately.,she don't like to overclock to good and scored a sp score of 50.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this.,ddr 5 will be better then too.,i can't justify moving from a 9900k it still kicks ass.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that is so weird!,i'm in the same exact boat i just gave my sister my 9900k and my little brother my 10850k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for sure i copped a reap good deal for the 11900k i paid 350 for it.,i see a sale for the 12700k for 374 on amazon.,i am curious to see any gains if any or if it was worth it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

holy!,thanks for the detailed post i agree 100 percent with you.,i game at 1440 p with a 3090 and an 11900k.,i'm thinking about getting the 12700k and investing that extra 300 i would of spent on a 12900k for a top tier board that way it's ready to rock with the 13900k.,now the thing is yes i love overclocking and such that's why i really want the 12900k.,i wasn't sure go good these 12700k were binned.,i was wondering kind of how lucky to you have to be in order to get all core on a minimum of 5.0 or above.,"i use abt with my 11900k and she's not the most top tier but decent, she can hit all cores at 5.1 with it on.",i didn't get lucky and get all core 5.2 and above like some people.,i'm just wondering in comparison what the 11900k will look like with my abt settings compared to the 12700k with at least a 4.8 overclock on there.,i'm kind of guessing maybe 10 fps more on 12700k?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™m sorry if i sound condescending, but if you donâ€™t feel difference between 10850k and 12700k, do you really think itâ€™s smart to get a 12900k?","i mean, iâ€™m pretty sure youâ€™re making a mistake.",an expensive one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i don't know if that's losing the lottery or it's just rocket lake being warm in general.,i was playing with oc-ing and i have a ml360 sub-zero which can really only deal with the heat produced in unregulated mode.,"i think it's because the 3090 i pair it with is making the case a heat chamber, too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ahhh i mean the numbers are there.,a lot of youtube and other tech review channels/sites may not do as in-depth testing for 12th gen games.,and so they show minimal gains for 12th gen. but that is because most games are gpu bound.,it is true.,"but if we look at real cpu bound benchmarks, the 12th gen is leagues ahead.",[digital foundry review.,"](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2021-intel-core-i9-12900k-i5-12600k-review?page=4)

see what you get.",compare it to your old temps and voltages.,do a cb r23 bench and record the results.,"if temps and voltage are good, you can try for 5.2 all core.",lower ac & dc ll with llc4 will equal lower voltage and lower wattage use.,"if results are no good, then your friend can tinker with it some more =)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hard to given sound advice with so little information.,"location, budget, previous system, use case, etc.",that being said the 11600f is a better cpu than the 3600. both lack integrated graphics and youâ€™ll need a dedicated gpu to even use your system.,the 12400 or 12600k are far better than either if they are within your budget.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
buying 3600 with an am4 boards give you upgrad option to zen 3 or zen3d 5800x3d.,"buying 11600f is better at performance, but not much upgrade options.",my opinion - buy intel 12th -superior performance and price.,then call it a day - if you are on budget 12400f and b660 mobo - if you have several hundred bucks - 12700k and a solid z690 board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"for 12400 it shows like this- 
memory specifications

what's with that upto ddr4 3200 mt/s??",?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6600 is a lot costlier over here than 3050. that's y i decided to go for 3050. still overpriced but what to do.,don't want to buy an older gpu.,i am hoping further updates will improve the 3050. we all heard that it not so good as compared to 1660s but intime updates might make it better.and 1660s way too costly due to mining.,incase of b660 might consider asus prime over gigabye b660.,yea cooler will see how the stock works and if needed will invest in a better one later.,60hrz monitor = 10000+ fps?,lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
asus prime ok?,over gigabyte?,yea will look for a gold psu 550 like u said.,as for ssd m.2 seems cheaper nowdays over ssd.,il stick with the monitor for now.,hehe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"even pcie 3.0 is still enough for gpus, there's no difference between it and 4.0 as far as i'm concerned, not sure about ssds, tho.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm not really knowledgeable with intel mobos and chipsets.,"i see people generally recommending the b660 boards for non-k cpus, but i've yet to figure out why.","24"" 1080p 144 hz ips monitors are really good these days and not expensive at all.",i'd definitely recommend getting one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that means i have to get only that 3200mhz ones.,not 3600 as it will be useless for that extra mhz for that 12400.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ah okayy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, intel's been doing a few odd things recently.",when the cpus became pretty much the best products they broke the voltages... haha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's guaranteed.,but idk why they do that at this point,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"don't go with the stock cooler unless all what's you're going to do is game, it's a big no especially in summer, check this video out on it if you haven't yet: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhkbabcfmpk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhkbabcfmpk)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm not sure about particular models, you'll have to do research.",and yeah a 1tb m.2 nvme ssd shouldn't run you too much.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
k series cpus are overclockable and only z series boards can overclock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol...okay.,i haven't check any specs about 650 boards.,will look into it once.,will try to get a 1080p monitor...in time.,thank you for ur time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"from other users' report, 3466mhz is achievable.","to run it stable at 3600mhz, it's really depending on the quality of cpu imc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hmmm...it's the 12th gen cpu and not the best but the latest gpu.,but i still can't use 3600mhz ram?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah, no, i meant why they recommend b660 over h610/h670.",the only thing i know is that h610 apparently has no pcie4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so what shud i get?,the 3200 or 3600. since i wont be overclocking it.,(12400) it is possible to overclock with some mobos i heard but i just wanna use it as stable as it is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can.... it's not officially supported but u can use.,most ppl do,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ha, h670 i believe is slightly expensive, h610 doesn't have memory overclocking, which kinda became a common thing these days.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"h670 is actually better than b660 but i think they are pretty rare, youâ€™ll probably encounter more b660 motherboards for sale usually.","as for h610, it doesnâ€™t support ram oc which leaves performance on the table.",h610 only make sense for the i3 maximum.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3200 without a doubt, its also cheaper than 3600",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
okay yes i could use.,but i as far as i know i cant go beyond that 3200 mhz right evn if i want it wouldn't make any difference buying a 3600 mhz as of now in my build.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"h610 still supports xmp to 3200, which is more than enough for budget oriented buyers.","the biggest downside to h610 is that they aren't all that much cheaper than the cheap b660 boards, you save $10-$30.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a quick google shows that h610 apparently [supports xmp up to 3200](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/s4i1sh/does_h610_motherboard_support_xmp/).,"which should be more than enough for an average midrange build, no?",what kind of ram oc isn't supported?,"i don't think many people are actually doing *manual* ram oc, fiddling with voltages, clocks, timings and whatnot.",and what other ram oc is there besides xmp profiles and manual oc?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can go beyond 3200mhz if u get a mobo that has something apart from a h610,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd say the biggest downside to them is that they come with 2 dimm slots instead of 4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"damn, i didnâ€™t know they supported xmp.",i just thought that xmp was together with memory overclocking.,"probably down to pcie lanes, vrms and future cpu upgrade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes that's the question i wanna know.,if i buy a 3600 will i be able to utilise it?,since it already says only ddr4 3200.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is the most difficult puzzle to me is that h-b-h-z names.,amd just duplicates the last two digits: you can remove either the letter or the last digits from a520-b550-x570 and you'll still be able to uniquely identify them.,but the fact that h670 is better than b660 which is in turn better than h610 really baffles me and makes me think the letter is completely irrelevant.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bruh yes.,you will be able to use it at 3600mhz freq,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"true, they should have made named the h670 chipset as b660 and b660 as h670.",z690-b660-h670-h610 would be much easier to understand.,"but damn now that h610 supports xmp, a $100 board paired with a 12400f at 65w or a 12100f is probably one of the best budget gaming build someone could do right now.",i just calculated a 12400f + h610 combo in my region and itâ€™s just $30 more than a 5600x alone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol okay.,il get the 3600 one then.,i asked many noob questions sorry for that.,i am basically a beginner for a pc.,thank you for your time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i actually do have a spare dead z690.. wondering about lapping it now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wouldn't it void warranty?,i don't think it's worth it.,have you tried the washer mod already?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lapping?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lapping does void warranty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
update: iâ€™m almost done.,worked like a charm!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
let me know the results!,iâ€™m curious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can't really do anything.,plug in while playing and set to high performance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dual channel ram.,make sure your igp is not being throttled.,"avoid high resolutions, intel hd is bottlenecked majorly by draw call potential.",don't overexaggerate in anything using shaders as it's not a big chip.,filters such as fsr from low resolutions are recommended.,overclocking would help a lot but it's next to impossible if you're not really willing to get your hands dirty.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you have dual channel ram?,most laptops shipped with a single stick in the past.,adding another might improve performance but don't expect a miracle.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqvoxa9k-ue,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what does high performance do for igpu?,"i was trying to search for it and asked a question yesterday here, but was unable to find any answers at all.","i know that for cpu it makes it run at boosted frequencies at all times, but that doesn't seem to be the case for igpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is there a way that you can do that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'm not really sure.,"but judging from what nvidia does when u select prefer high performance, it might just keep the clocks high all the time",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do what?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
overclock the cpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
possible but not worth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why is it not worth it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because even though you could get performance intel has locked down their mobile chips throughly so you'd need a lot of bios modding.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok i understand.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can try overclocking that ram up to 3200 mhz.,"it's what i have done with my 2666 mhz cl16 ram, now it's overclocked to 3200 mhz cl15 and the performance difference is quite drastic, from 110 ns to 62.9 ns according to aida memory latency test.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2400mhz is probably worst case scenario for alder lake, and whatever you do make sure itâ€™s not in gear 2. itâ€™ll work, obviously, but you will get a much bigger performance boost going from 2400 to 3200 than you would from 3200 to 4000.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it wonâ€™t be horrible, it should still perform decently until you get proper ram",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3200 cl16 is about $50 and 3600 cl16 is about $82 for 16gb.,worth upgrading to if you can afford it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"going from a crapy first gen ryzen to alder lake will give you a huge boost regardless, anyway 2400mhz ram is really slow, you can try and overclock it and see if you get anything",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

was it in gear 2 before the oc?,my 11700f prebuilt was 'only' 90-95ns with 3200c22 even in gear 2. now i flashed the bios to do gear 1 and it became 60-62ns.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

power consumption is the main reason.,if you have a small case or using the stock cooler for example.,lower power means less heat which usually means less noise.,pl2 on a 12700k is close to 190 watts.,most motherboards will try to run k skus at pl2 indefinitely.,thatâ€™s a lot of cooling needed to remove that kind of heat.,non k chips usually the motherboard will default to running it at the intel recommended power settings which is like a few minutes at pl2 and then back down to  pl1 which would be a manageable 65w,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
get a kf sku.,they are usually cheaper than the k sku and overclock just as good if not a little better or take less voltage sometimes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thereâ€™s no reason not to get the k. if you really donâ€™t want the improved performance and prefer the lower power / heat of the non-k, you can easily change the pl1/pl2 limits to behave identically.","so 190/125 for the k, and 180/65 for the non-k.

it should be noted that a lot of boards will default to running the 12700 like a k cpu in regard to pl1/pl2, meaning it will remain at a 180 watt limit indefinitely (so youâ€™d have to change things for it to behave stock, just like you would have to with a k chip).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12700f is 315 on central computer.com and the 12700kf is 384. the non f versions are 59 dollar difference in same site.,not sure what site youâ€™re looking at.,maybe theyâ€™re closer in price on some other sites.,", if you donâ€™t need overclocking and also want to use the stock fan then the non k is a much better deal imho",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that might not be a terrible thing.,"the motherboard makers will ram as much vccsa as they can get away with once you enable xmp, even though at ddr4 speeds it's totally unnecessary.",my asus board raises it to 1.4 as soon as i enable xmp on my 3600. i put it back to 1.0 and my cpu runs like 4â° cooler under load.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can just buy the k chip for future proofing and manually lower the power limits and undervolt.,"then, if later, you get a better cooler/mobo/whatever you can fully utilize the k chip.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thst was with 11gen.,isn't adl supposed to run pl2 indefinitely is cooling allows ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">power consumption is the main reason

there is no difference in power consumption.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"pl2 will run indefinitely on both k and non-k, and you can simply lower the value with your motherboard.",there is no reason to not get the k if it's the same price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this.,hopefully the fuma 2 you've already ordered can handle the heatload.. .,it's meant to be good but i'm not sure it's 190w good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the reply.,"i do want the integrated gpu for a few reasons, so the kf is off the table for me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've run the 12700k on a fuma 2.,"190 w is within its capability, but barely.","as long as the 190 w power limit is actually enforced, it shouldn't ever thermal throttle.",mine was getting up to 86â° at 184 w.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the i5 will be fine at those resolutions.,"if you really want to juice up that 3080 and you have the budget, go for the i7",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
youd even be fine with a 12400 if youre just gaming at 4k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah for that same reason iâ€™m going 12600k, for like $100 difference i can get a game with a new cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12600k and overclock it as high as it'll go.,"maybe consider the i7 if you really need those 2 extra cores, but don't even think about the i9.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i do have the money but i would only want to spend it if its worthwhile, how much more juice would the i7 provide?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it'll probably be in competitive gaming, but just a couple fps.",the bigger result would be if you're into cpu intensive tasks.,"if it's only for gaming in 1440p/2160p, the difference will be minimal.","that 12600k would be great with some overclocking, and cheaper.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at 4k?,nothing.,you will be gpu limited 99% of the time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
roughly 5%,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on the games you play.,even at 4k games like war thunder are cpu limited.,but weâ€™re talking a very small sample of games where there will be a measurable difference and an even smaller portion of those will allow you to actually perceive a difference based on your cpu choice.,at 4k realistically you wonâ€™t notice a difference between a 12400 and a 12700k in almost every scenario.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

just throwing an idea out thereâ€¦ the pump may be having difficulty changing speeds reliably.,"so, for example, in cinebench the load/temperatures are consistent so the pump would hit a particular speed and then just basically stay there for the duration of the test.","but with a game, load changes dynamically, going up and down from high to low, and maybe occasionally something is preventing the pump from being able to ramp up when it needs to, thus causing a sudden overheat.",if you have a way of monitoring pump rpm speeds i would try to keep an eye on that during one of these overheat/crashes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that has nothing to do with performance in real world from vids i seen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my point is that they arenâ€™t the same chip.,12th gen is way more efficient.,uses a smaller manufacturing process 10nm vs the old 14nm.,for similar gaming performance i can use a 12400 at 60w or an 11700k at 180w no brainer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

is this true even when the 3600 is overclocked?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it completes with the 5600x, but look out for 660 motherboards that support non-k oc.","search for non-k oc, that way you can redneck oc a chip that wouldn't be able otherwise.",this way you get even more performance for absolute free.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
salut.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nonsense, 3470",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a bit better?,"intel's 12th gen alder lake cpus wipe the floor with zen 3 lol, stop being a fanboy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh could you please explain what youâ€™re saying ( pc noob here).,thank you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so says the one using hyperbolic words.,"lol

generally the performance difference is less than 10% -- if that's your definition of ""wiping the floor"", then all the more power to you.","https://www.techpowerup.com/review/intel-core-i9-12900k-alder-lake-12th-gen/23.html

if we're talking about value proposition, that's different.","the 12400, 12600, and 12700 skus offer very compelling bang for the buck, and amd's overdue for a price cut on their zen 3 products imo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just ignore it, the thing he is talking about is bclk overclocking which allows locked non-k cpus (like the 12400f) to overclock, which currently only applies to $200+ motherboards, and doesnt make much sense spending $60-$100 extra for one of those boards compared to a cheaper h610 or cheaper b660.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not worth it really.,just get cheap b660 motherboard with all usbs you need.,"overclocking locked cpu could result in damaging it, especially with the stock cooler.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"also it is strictly against intel's policy,  last couple of times it happend intel make sure it is banned promptly.",so do not over spend expecting that feature to be there down the line.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how much is the 10900k in your area?,because you risk of overpaying for less performance simply because its an upgrade path.,in the us the 10900k sells for $450 still.,"but performs significantly worse in gaming/single thread and modestly worse in multi-thread than an i5-12600k which only costs $280, and if you factor in a b660 board for another $130-$150, so its cheaper and better performance to simply go to a 12th gen 12600k than upgrade to the 10900k.","you also get more features, use less power and an upgrade path with b660.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why do you want to upgrade?,"in gaming, you'll barely get any improvement.",switch out to a 12th gen i5/i7 with a b660 if u really need to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 10900k goes for around 450â‚¬ where im from.,so what you just suggested might be a better idea to go with.,thanks!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it's possible it's due to thermal throttling, check the temperatures while gaming (or during benchmark).","it's common in older laptops, it is caused by the thermal paste drying out and/or the airways near the fan blocked by dust.",during gaming the temperature of cpu/igpu may be getting too high and for protection they are downclocked (causing the performance drop).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there are no 3gb sticks of ram.,"gonna be 2gb and 4gb, with one possibly soldered to the board.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

probably.,don't know for certain though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, those chipsets allow pl2 changes.","and as far as using less power when not gaming, pl2 is simply the max allowed power, its not locking your voltage and frequency at the max, so it will throttle down when not being used.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mini-itx might have limits enabled by default.,full sized boards almost never do.,check and see when you get the board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a 12400 will sustain pl2 indefinitely on any b660 board.,"most of them have vrms carried over from the incredibly inefficient 11th gen, so you're not going to have any problem with power delivery.","just get a good cooling solution, either a good 240 mm aio or a big air cooler and you'll be set.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can i be reasonably confident if i get a board in the higher end of h670 or b660 there will be motherboard settings to remove those limits?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"until hardware unboxed does somw extensive b660 testing like they did for b560s, i wouldn't comfortably go higher than a 12400 (which is a great choice).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"what would be the point of using the efficiency cores if they canâ€™t even sustain max performance along with the performance cores on a cheap motherboard, like youâ€™re just shooting yourself in the foot at that point due to the lower level components on said board 

just get an adequate z690 or some i7-12700 on a good b660 so you wouldnâ€™t be limiting yourself on a cheap b660 + 12600k (not like it would make much financial sense to be pairing such a processor on board anyway)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how much is the 12700f where you are?,"any task that benefits from e cores is going to be a lot better on a 12700 than a 12600k, and the difference is usually under $100.","if you want e cores and don't want to oc, the 12700f with a cheap b660 is definitely the way to go.","with the 12600k, you're paying a premium towards the fact the part is unlocked, so if you don't buy a z690 you're wasting your money.","it will work sure, but it's like spending $200 on a high end liquid cooler for a 65 w tdp cpu: you're paying extra for something you don't need.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"im not well versed on motherboards, could you explain to me why the lower end b660s arenâ€™t capable of sustained max performance, and recommend a specific better board?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i dont know what he's going on about, an asus prime will absolutely be able to handle a 12600k at stock settings, which youll be forced to have because its b660.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a lower b660 wouldnâ€™t work well for you since youâ€™d be losing  performance on the i5, a lot of potential is being lost for it, but due to the lower end components on a motherboard, there has to be some limit on voltages and such so it can keep a sustainable upkeep with the processor and not overheat on the vrms 

if [itâ€™s a board for something like an i7-12700, iâ€™d get something like this ](https://www.newegg.com/p/n82e16813144520?item=n82e16813144520), a bit pricey but it works

the real question is what is the reason you're upgrading?,"if it is for better single thread performance, why not just get a 5600x or 5800x for your current motherboard?",that will keep you very fast for possibly a few years.,"then, if futureproofing is something that concerns you, wait until ddr5 gets faster and cheaper, and do your full platform switch only then.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i dont know prices in europe, but consider a 12700f ($320) + b660 ($130).","the 12700f is basically identical performance to a 12700k, but cheaper due to no overclocking or igp, and beats the $550 5900x.","longevity wise it should be the best pick of the bunch, full 8 performance cores plus 4 e-cores, but its still a great price.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yea the pricing in the us is always excluding taxes so add 5-10 or maybe 12 % also i havenâ€™t since a single 12700 costing 320 as i think the retail pricing even in the us is 409 but shows up at 374 on amazon from time to time.,on the question i went for a 12700k myself on a tomahawk wifi as some issues were reported on the asus boards but i think a 12600k and an msi pro a is a great match,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if he lives in eu then you can easy add 25% to the price due to tax and fee and what not.,so that cpu cost at least 400 $ and that board cost 250 ish $ so over his budget unless he buys it from [amazon.de](https://amazon.de) or choose the amazon site in his country.,then he can get em cheaper .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i feel like his take is short sighted.,12th and 13th gen support ddr4 *and* ddr5.,"zen 3+ (mobile 6000) and zen 4 only support ddr5, so if anyone is going to get punished by ddr5 pricing and availability its amd, not intel.","as far as motherboard pricing goes, yes lga1700 is more expensive than am4, but its a brand new bigger socket with more chipset features, launched during a component shortage.","am4 is cheaper, but am5 will be more expensive than lga1700 due to feature parity and being a new release at the time, i guarantee it.",also am4 is end of life with no upgrade path.,"people are recommending 12th gen, even on the /r/amd sub when it comes to new buyers, its only existing am4 owners that are sticking with amd right now, but thats a given.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"probably true, since you asked for safe was just giving and example.","likely if it makes full contact itâ€™ll be ok, i suppose if the older cooler was only expecting 125w load and now itâ€™s seeing 250 or so it may cause thermal throttle but for internet use or even just to try i donâ€™t think itâ€™ll hurt.","if you going for hardcore benching and overclocked then ya, getting lga1700 cooler may be better",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks, i'm gonna keep my eyes open for more info, i'll only upgrade after rtx40/rdna 3 will come out so i'll probably go for raptor lake by then, but since that will also use lga1700 i don't think there will be much of a difference in terms of cooling (unless intel pushes the tdp even further lol).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"looks like a good budget build, obviously h610 has limited features in terms of i/o and memory slots, but if you don't need those it's perfectly fine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i don't see any issue with the build.,"but personally, i'd go with a b660 mobo.",and maybe a better gpu (if u can find).,because that gpu is almost 6 years old now.,a 6500xt would do better.,you might be able to find that.,3050?,2060 maybe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

as others have pointed out it would probably be a good idea to look for a budget b660 board because the h610 boards will only have 2 ram slots meaning in order for you to upgrade in the future you will need to fully replace the 2 sticks you have.,if you get a b660 board you will have two more slots that you could put another 2 8gb sticks in for an easy upgrade if you ever find yourself running out of ram on newer games.,note: some b660 boards will also only have 2 ram dimms,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

for mobos i generally look at the i/o in the back and see if it has all the connectivity i want and see if it fits the price.,but if you just want budget you can just get the asus b660 prime basically the b660 version of that same board you have for 40 bucks more.,but then if you donâ€™t need the features then you can put that 40 towards a better power supply or gpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh.. unless you're overpaying too much it shld be fine.,be prepared to be extremely disappointed if u game at 1440p or higher lol.,running a 1050ti at 1440p.. very disappointing even in cs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

go quadro t600 pretty cheap will rival a 1050ti,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh thats an interesting situation.,"i think you should still go with the 12th gen because you could upgrade the cpu later too, while the older socket is dead now.",and you could always later buy a better psu too and just sell you old one maybe?,there isn't a *huge* difference between 550w and 600w.,"but it's maybe also worth to spend just a little bit more on an mb that has at least some heatspreaders, like the asus prime h610m-a d4.",here where i live it's just 3â‚¬ more,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i don't need the features but maybe a little more heatspreaders and two more ram slots is better, thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"xd, the good is that i play at 1080p and for the only game i play i think the 1050 ti is much more than enough.","i'm taking the 1050 ti as a very pricey stopgap for a future gpu because the only other gpu that would cost less is a gt 1030 at 100 euro so i prefer to waste money on a gpu that can do much more than a now very basic gpu like the 1030. at least when i look for gpus on amazon i can't find any other than the 1050 but if you want to give a look if you can find it then i would like to know, maybe i'm missing some listings.",you should look at amazon italy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yes, didn't see the a version, it's exactly 3 euros the difference xd.","ok so, at this point, there is a clear choice for you for a motherboard around 150-200 dollars (or euros, it's almost the same) or the m-a d4 will suffice?",if i upgrade the cpu as you say will the 2 slots and 64 gb max be enough or not for that cpu?,"and maybe i didn't say it but i should say that the 600 w bronze evga is 50 euros while the 550w seasonic is 90, so wich one or do you have a better alternative?",anyway thanks for your advices.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for example i see the rx 6500 xt at 420, the gtx 1650 at 390 and the 1660 super at 550. also is it better a gigabyte b660m ds3h ddr4 or an asus tuf gaming b660m plus?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40â‚¬ more for 50w more is pretty expensive if you ask me.,"i think it would make more sense to spend more money on an b660m mb, as you would be able to use it longer.",the cheapest one i could find is the gigabyte b660m ds3h ddr4 and even that would make quite a big difference in comparison to the h610m board.,"if you want something really solid and have some more money, you could also go with the asus tuf gaming b660m-e d4, but both would be way better than the h610 board.",so the gigabyte one would be good too if you don't want to spend that much more.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you ate getting that lga1700 bow in the ihs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
x-pattern still seems evident.,thermal paste liquifies as the cpu heats up and solidifies as the cooler cools it.,movement toward the hotter areas under cpu heatsink and depending on cpu-motherboard-case orientation.,tighten enough for good contact and much below any cooler-to-cpu pressure cracks either.,"best to compare thermals amongst others with similar setups, but as long as performance hiccups are not noticeable and longevity isn't an issue, i wouldn't be too concerned.","&#x200b;

not rly.,u can use 3600 maybe 3800 maybe higher.,3200 or 3600 would be the sweet spot.,"2666 is what will run without memory ""overclocking"".",you can get 3600kits.,almost all newer cpus support only upto 3200. but they run just fine with 3600 or 3800,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"they're the same thing inside and out, only difference is that the igpu is disabled, probably one will be better binned or whatever but in real world performance you're not really gonna see much of a difference, if at all",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nope.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
every website ive seen shows 1fps more on the 12700f.,"its not a matter of just ""igpu"" disabled.","although that is true,

the 12700 and 12700f are binned differently

in terms of binnage the link would look like

12700 12700f 12700kf 12000k

if a 12700 bins bad, even if its just the igpu it is further ""modified"" into an i5

binned from right to left.","the 12700 although the same ""silicon""

is binned the worst ""the silicon lottery"" and things like auto clock rates and 

temperatures probably wont do as well.","so yes, technically, no performance difference

thanks i'll ask there as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the cooler is not good enough.,get a new cooler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i suspect that your mb removes all power limits by default.,a lot of z690 mb's do that.,you can set the power limits manually.,noctua says the u9s is rated for 140 watts.,i would recommend setting both pl1 and pl2 to 140 watts.,note that this will reduce your all core performance but probably not your single core performance.,your only other options are to live with the thermal throttling (you'll probably get worse performance than setting power limits but it depends) or upgrade to a more high performance cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
youâ€™re using a 5 heat pipe single fan cooler for a 12700k?,thatâ€™s the problem.,grab a u12a.,it should cool and fit perfectly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a lot of mobos overclock by default and tend to apply much more voltage than needed.,you could see if you can tweak it a bit.,at least you'll be able to stop it from thermal throttling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm using a 12700k in a sff build with a nh-l12 ghost edition.,i think the nh u9s definitely should match or exceed the performance of that.,"here is what i did:

disabled the e-cores and igpu

undervolted the p-cores with 0.1v (made a huge difference!)","powerlimits to 150w (28 seconds) and 125w long term

105mhz base clock

some other tweaks to memory timings etc

&#x200b;

very good performance and stays 70 to 80â°c, under all-core 4.4ghz maximum load",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if your motherboard allows look into undervolting your cpu, often times out of the box motherboards give more voltage than necessary.",i ran a 9900k and 10900k undervolted with the u9s in the ncase m1 for awhile and had no temp issues while gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"your cooler isn't enough for the power limits of a 12700k, keep lowering your power limit until it's at a comfortable enough temperature.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have a b660-i, i think i do not have voltage options... any cooler suggestion?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's 158mm, i doubt i can fit it, maximum height i can fit is 150mm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how to check that?,in bios my asus b660-i rog strix shows 4700 mhz core voltage 1.350 v. is that more than stock?,edit: target cpu performance core speed shows 5000 mhz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the noctua nh-d15 can cope with the 12700k otherwise look at 280/360 aio's check they're rates for at least 190w but the more the better.,even if you mb doesn't support overclocking it might have configurable power limits.,you can use hwinfo to check how much power your cpu is actually drawing.,if it's drawing 180w plus continuously in cinebench r23 then the power limits have been removed.,if it draws 180w for a minute or so then drops to 65w then power limits are being enforced.,if your current cooler can't cope with 65w then there's something wrong.,it might be a contact issue.,you could try reseating the cooler and ensuring good spread and pressure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you always can set the pl1 and pl2 levels.,can't imagine you can't set that.,"set it to something like pl2=150w, tau=28seconds,pl1=125w.","basically the cpu will now run at **unlimited** power, and boost and boost and draw more power until *something* causes it to throttle.","be it cpu temperature, vrm's not able to cope, etc.",you will get maximum performance but it's completely expected it will get hot if operated that way.,it will simply boost until it gets 100â°c.,"and if you add a larger cooler, it will boost even further and still get 100â°c... (or you need to be limited by the actual current that can be delivered, which you won't with any air cooler).",see what's happening?,"it will 'always' boost until 100â°c, that's just how those 'k' cpu's operate by default (but you can always change the behavior).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
damn.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to clarify, the 12700k which the poster says he has is 190/125 watts.","the 12700, no k, is 180/65 watts as you are describing.",in reading the thread iâ€™m just not sure why youâ€™re mentioning 12700 limits here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12700 limits are quite realistic as a starting point for a sff build with such a cooler?,i'd start about there and then tweak from there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looked up the wrong figures.,thanks for clarifying.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if i use a h670 or b660 motherboard.,can i still undervolt / set power limits on the processor?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,i have a h670 mobo and it has options for this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why a z690 with a 12400?,makes no sense,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pretty sure it has to do with the total cost of the itx system.,"i too have used non k cpus with z board when only them allowed for mem oc, and i am pretty sure he bought the z690 itx mobo just because it is the only one available right now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah there's no supply for budget 12th gen itx boards yet, i figured i might be paying $100 extra or so long term for a z series, but i get to start much sooner.",aud$299 for this board was much more tempting than aud$549 for asus/gigabyte,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

could you under clock a modern cpu that low?,is there a limit?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think modern ones go up to 800 or so mhz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
isn't it dependent on bus frequency?,if this cpu have bus frequency of 100 mhz (that's what's in the cpu-l) then if you could set multiplier to 1 (i don't know if that's possible) then lower limit of frequency would be 100 mhz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i dont see a reason why they couldnt go even lower given that other devices are ok with it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that being said.",i5 is a 6p/4e - 16t beast!,and the i7 is a 8p/4e - 20t ... another beast!,do you really need all those cores and threads?,probably not today but in the future?,maybe.,what buying the i9 or i7 affords you over the i5 are better binned chips.,better overclocked units.,"and if you need the threads, they help there too.","if you aren't thread limited, you can go with the i5.",if you want highest single core performance i5 < i7 < i9.,same ranking for overclocking as well.,"this is because when you are gaming, a single thread/core is all that matters.",and the game load will be about 50 to 60 watts no matter which cpu you pick.,well more power on the i9 because they have additional cores to power.,it's all up to you really.,but you can cool anything in an sff build.,people put 3080s in there!!!,the cpu should be the least of your concerns!,"if it were me, i'd go with the i7 as i believe it will overclock a bit better and they are better binned.",i9 for the ultimate overclock/binned chips!,but yeah sff will limit its cooling potential.,so maybe the i5 is all you need?,but the binning on i5 is not as excellent as the binning on i7?,difficult choices for sure!,but that's part of the fun right?,"=)

12700k with configured  with thermal velocity boost will be better.,"say you aim to have 4.8 all cores and have +2 in tvb, your chip will boost to 5ghz all core if you are below a certain temperature threshold.","it's not the same as throttling hard because of thermal limits, but a smart way to keep temps in check.",and the voltage seem to behave a little less agresive too.,"if you are gaiming, you will likely remain under temp threshold, if you are doing heavy stuff, chip might just remove the tvb and work with it's own set boost and lower volts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i overclock my 12700kf and it doesnâ€™t run hot.,you just canâ€™t skimp on your cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with a sff you should be undervolting to lower voltage/heat.,the 12700k is a better binned chip and will undervolt better.,that nh-c14s is no slouch!,it performs within 2 degrees of the legendary nh-d15.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

literally it hit 80 degrees just by booting the menu for battlefield 2042. just sitting on the menu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had seen the nh-d15 from noctua recommended also.,do you know of that one and itâ€™s possible comparison to the one you run?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2042 murders cpus and shoots temps up like crazy.,not so with the u12a or d15.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the d15 is good.,itâ€™s way bigger and there can be ram clearance issues with some ram.,not all.,the u12a cools just as good and is smaller and doesnâ€™t have any ram clearance issues.,go with whichever is cheapest as they are both great coolers.,i went u12a just to make sure my ram wasnâ€™t covered up with that front fan.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
update: noctua u12a has entirely solved my issues â˜ºï¸,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ya ram might be an issue with my ngl.,my current fan is already right up against it.,might try the one you have,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the nh-d15s is a version of the nh-d15 designed for better ram and gpu clearance.,"the nh-u12a is supposed to be on par with them, though, so there's little reason not to get the nh-u12a if there is a clearance concern.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">noctua u12a

that's strange, tests between those two shows the hyper 212 is just a bit worse than noctua.",did you mount your hyper 212 with lga1700 kit or did you get one of those motherboards with dual mounting holes?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s a great cooler.,well worth the money.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the u12a cools better than the 15s.,the d15 and u12a are within 2c of each other despite the u12a being the smallest of the 3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
funny enough the noctua solved everything.,no issues now.,the hyper had the mounting kit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
appreciate it man.,i just hope itâ€™s the cooler thatâ€™s the issue ðÿ˜…ðÿ˜…ðÿ˜….,"just spent all this time and money getting the new chip and mobo, so hopefully itâ€™s not something less straight forward",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yup, that's what i meant by â€œon par.â€ noctua did some awesome job on the nh-u12a.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
make sure your mobo is compatible.,most of the asus z-690 have an issue with the u12a and dh-15(s).,asus decided to add a silly little plastic piece on top of the vram that made it too bulky to clear a lot of the high end tower coolers.,edit: just realized i replied to the wrong comment.,but comment still applies if you have any z-690 board from asus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
grab a good quality thermal paste like kryonaught too along with the cooler.,use the spread method for the 12700k so the whole chip is covered.,iâ€™m betting your temps will be much better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the d15s runs 4c hotter than either though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have an msi board and i checked compatibility, they should be good!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™m using some corsair thermal paste right now that seems decent enough, but maybe i under-applied",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
really?,doesn't make much sense to me.,"the heatsink is huge, if only a little smaller than that of the nh-d15, and the rest is the same.","looking at this test, i don't see any significant difference:

[https://www.legitreviews.com/noctua-nh-d15s-versus-nh-d15-cpu-cooler-review\_188613/3](https://www.legitreviews.com/noctua-nh-d15s-versus-nh-d15-cpu-cooler-review_188613/3)

it also depends on how many fans are installed on it and how fast they're rotating, so 2c/4c difference doesn't mean a thing by itself, we have to consider the noise as well.",not that it's really important.,"all three are very quiet coolers with great performance, and that what matters.",minor differences don't.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m not familiar with their paste.,"iâ€™ve only ever used gelid gc xtreme, kryonaught and kryonaught extreme.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah the 15s lacks due to the second fan not being present.,the u12a has more heat pipes and a higher fin density so thatâ€™s how it achieves the performance it does.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gotcha gotcha.,i may look into that as well as a new cooler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i donâ€™t think the paste is such an issue.,"all reviews shows that the kryonaught is great but nothing that justify the extremely pricy from the others, always a 1-2 temps below all.",op probably refer to the corsair tm30/40 which is decent.,"just make sure to use the spread method, with alder lake series it is important.",good luck!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nothing prevents installing a second fan on the nh-d15s, though.",that's what i did.,"it comes with mounting brackets for the second fan, so i just installed a second 120 mm one on it (a 140 mm one would have ram clearance issues).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends a lot on what it's paired with.,ssd or hard drive?,how much memory?,any discrete graphics card?,"the cpu itself should be fine for light tasks, if it's got an ssd and 8 gb of memory to work with.",without a separate graphics card it might struggle with video playback due to the older implementation of quick sync.,newer codecs won't get hardware decoding.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, as long as you don't plan on gaming or using it for cpu intensive ""productivity"" programs it will be good enough.","just don't be fooled by the i5 branding, it has nothing in common with current 10th-12th gen i5s or even i3s that are emuch faster than it.",its performance is much closer to a pentium because newer dual cores with hyper-threading are very capable of easily beating older quad cores without hyper-threading.,"so if you can get a 10th/12th gen pentium + motherboard for cheaper then they would be faster for a lower price, as well as having a much quieter cooler.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
presumably you are on a strict budget.,don't overpay for something like this - they should be very cheap used.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's a 8-9 year old cpu.,"if it's free it is probably ok for basic use, but you should not pay real money for a system that old.",good chance the motherboard won't last too much longer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"paired with hdd, 8gb ram.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh, thanks for a great tip.",newer generations are big deal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"may i ask what the i3 10105 is capable of in terms of productivity, assuming you use it for any?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

basic web browsing and office documents should work fine.,"it won't be speedy, and it will boot slowly, but with the exception of video it's probably ok.  it's a quad-core?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"upgrade with a low storage ssd(if all you do is web browsing/documents) as the boot drive and for your main programs, and it'll be a fairly fast machine and fine for years to come.","if your web browsing is very \*intense\* maybe add another 8 gb, but unless you're running a bunch of stuff in the background then the 8 gb should be absolutely fine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's progress man, new i3s beating every old enough i7 and new pentiums beating every old enough i5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it depends on whether or not you need a full pc or only a few parts, personally i can't truly answer either, i myself have an extremely old running pentium e2200, a 15 years old processor and i rather stick to it even if it's much more nightmarish than an 8-9 years old one, it's just a big no at this point, even a modern pentium out to do perform a lot better, my current budget is around $290 and pc parts are overpriced in my country and i can in no way build/buy a full pc with newer parts with it, i'm forced to just replace a few of them, mainly the cpu, mobo, ram and psu, i can barely fit them all because my aim is a quad core like the i3 10100, that's the least i'm willing to go for right now, if i could cut the psu out it may become possible but i know i can't and i have to push my budget a bit further, anyways, bottom of the line if your situation is similar to mine than replace only the needed parts, if it's not then it's tighter but look up what you can build/buy for $250, use [pcpartpicker.com](https://pcpartpicker.com) too, it's ought to help and be better than the older i5 you're aiming for even if it's going to end up being 3/4 years old, it's still going to be better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what motherboard?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep all normal and nothing to worry about.,the reason for the spikes is a short clock speed and voltage burst usually for some process.,"the core max of 100'c just means at that maximum distance your cpu was 100'c away from the max safe temp, this is usually a reading upon first boot, again nothing to worry about :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my package is around \~31c with spikes to \~48c.,ambient is \~20c.,much less capable cooler than yours - big shuriken 3 with noctua a12x25 fan.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

my 12700kf idles around 26c with a noctua u12a and iâ€™ve got it ocâ€™d at 5ghz.,i have a fractal torrent case where airflow is amazing but i would think an aio would provide better cooling than 45-50c at idle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what motherboard do you have that fits the shuriken?,"i didn't consider that cooler option due to the strix' enormous heatsinks, but it may have been a mistake.","i really wish i could sustain 130w instead of just 105w with the l9x65, although some uv helps at keeping clockspeeds decent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

pentium is still around.,"same with celeron, xeon, etc.",just marketing terms really.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and there's core 2 extreme.,you won't know how many cores inside....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"pentium is actually early 90s and as another poster pointed out, is still in use today.","celeron is also pretty old, late 90s.","the whole core naming thing is a bit confusing to me because there was two generations of core / core 2 duo / quad, and then they switched to â€œfirst generationâ€ core i3/i5/i7.",so technically the 12th generation core weâ€™re talking about today is 14th generation.,"(and now that i think about it, the lacklustre 11th generation was lucky #13.)","at any rate, typically thereâ€™s no need to change an established name unless you feel your marketing isnâ€™t connecting with customers.","around the time that core came out, the pentium brand was going through some bad architectures (like pentium iv), but in traditional intel fashion they couldnâ€™t get rid of it and eventually made it a bit lower end.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they get a new name when the old one becomes associated with being terrible.,they pushed pentium to the low end and introduced the core branding when pentium 4 and pentium d were shite.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what i wonder about is why they don't rename their pentium and celerons to core i1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

lmao,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ah okay.. so they're still using the 20 yr old architecture for pentiums...?,or it's just a name now?,also btw rn idts it's 14th gen. it wld be more in the 18 or 19th.,since there were genrations for the core to duo.,ranging from the e2200 to 9500,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

exavtly my thought lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i donâ€™t know.,they pay millions in market and branding research.,i do think a new name could have really helped with the switch to the big/small architecture change.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's just a name.,"the last cpus that i associated with the ""originals"" were the pentium 4 and pentium d, right before intel introduced the core microarchitecture.","they've continued to use the name on some of their chips, but they're based on the later designs (core, haswell, kaby lake, etc).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as the other poster pointed out, itâ€™s just marketing at this point.","but i do think that if ever they were going to come out with a new name, alder lake and its new p/e core architecture would have been it.",opportunity missed - or is it?,maybe alder lake is the first generation of a new line that wonâ€™t be named for another two or three years!,":)

looking at core history, youâ€™re right, itâ€™s messed up.","basically first core was solo / duo and mobile only and came out in 2006, desktop core 2 duo / quad following later that year.",this continued until 2010 when the current core naming scheme began.,"of course they also mixed in a bunch of confusion, with a mobile core 2 solo, core m3/m5/m7 at some point, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
always been bottom end and still sticking around.,no real push for them to change i guess.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah that same thought came into my mind,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i'm aware of that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah lol.,it'll get even more confusing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>so they're still using the 20 yr old architecture for pentiums...?,or it's just a name now?,maybe i misunderstood these questions \^\^\^,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have 12900k msi edge wifi ddr4.,gskill 2x8gb ddr 4000cl15 .,it easily hits xmp.,"i set my ram to 4000 cr1, gear1, 14-14-14 1.59. iâ€™m only using 2 dimms which probably helps.",i know i canâ€™t get anything past 4100 without lowering to gear2 and cr2.,"super happy with the combo, all core 5.2, 2 core 5.5, 4 core 5.4 .",went from 8700k to this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

do you know if the ram is jumping into g2 mode basically dropping down to 2000mhz?,same set of ram or some other manufacturer or model?,also know the board can make a difference as far as z690â€™s go the edge is about as premium as you are going to get.,"as for your cpu not too much info on overclock.net on the post i was reading i know the i9 12th gen imc is as good as it gets to date, not sure about the 12th gen i5 you have.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if anything, it now feels like intel has greater growth potential when compared to amd or nvidia because intel is about to re enter the gpu market.","it feels like people get wrapped in the ""amd performs better than intel for gaming"" when ryzen was released, not understanding that's a fraction of the market compared to the oem market.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's not the consumer market that has got amd's stocks sky rocketing.,it's their dominance in the server and data center space where long time intel strongholds have been switching to amd.,"in that industry, it means they are locked to amd's ecosystem for a good 5-10 years.",and the profit margin there is at least 10x the consumer space.,intel's long term outlook is pretty bleak in that space to be honest.,not even sapphire rapids look good enough to stop the current momentum.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"""major bottleneck"" of what?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've upgraded from 4770 to 12700k with a gtx 1070. you can always upgrade the gpu later.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is a good upgrade.,12600k is a great sweet spot and has significant headroom for more clocks.,this gives you a convenient avenue to upgrade gpu when availability catches up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gpu bottle neck is generally better than cpu bottle neck.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"even if you only use it for gaming and play games that max out your 1080, it will be a much smoother experience due to more consistent framerates/less stutters.","if you use it for esports type gaming with lower graphics, content creation or any heavy productivity task the difference will be like night and day.","the only thing that could cause a major bottleneck is not having an ssd, which is unfortunately still the case with some haswell systems.","if you have a decent ssd however, i would say it is absolutely a good idea to upgrade your platform and get the 12600k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i dont know, im ignorant in this matter, i thought latest cpu with a 5 year old gpu will cause trouble.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there won't be any trouble, it's 100% compatible and a great upgrade.","at some point you'll want to upgrade the gpu too, but it's still worth it to upgrade your cpu without upgrading your gpu at the same time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a gpu bottleneck imo is always fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the i5 is very well equipped to handle gaming for the next 3/4 years.,gtx 1080 may bottleneck for 1440p+ gaming.,i had a similar config - 4790k & gtx 980. decided to purchase the i5 12400 & iâ€™m seeing a massive boost in fps across multiple games.,hence decided to stretch the 980 for another year or two for 1080p gaming.,so donâ€™t worry about gpu bottlenecks.,12600k is brilliant.,just go for it!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the z690 tuf has really bad onboard audio for a modern motherboard, according to techyescity.","for z690 in particular, msi really nailed the bios side of things such that the best memory compatibility and clocks are on msi boards, both ddr4 and ddr5 alike.","for z690, i'd strongly recommend getting an equivalent priced or cheaper msi board over an asus one unless you want an asus specific feature like sp rating (that isn't in the tuf anyway).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
msi tomahawk lineup for both amd and intel is really good.,people buy asus because they have brand name power not because it is objectively the better option.,plus asus is usually overpriced for pretty much everything they sell.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's because asus has brand name power so people automatically recommend then even if the item is objectively worse than the competitiors.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can set pl1/pl2 to whatever you like.,there have been plenty of tests showing the 12900kâ€™s performance at various power limits.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"get a broadwell/skylake gen xeon for server, probably way cheaper.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the question remains.,is there a setting of pl1/pl2 that will make the k version behave like the non k?,can they have the same performance and consumption at the same time?,what is the setting?,i think the k will always be more inefficient for the same performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if we make the two use the same power, will they have the same performance?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"12900k are the best binned chips of the bunch, if anything, it potentially can be faster at the same power limits due to needing less voltage to achieve its target frequencies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my concern is those extra 100mhz the k may try to get and end up using itâ€™s allotted watts for that and be inefficient as a result.,at the same time the non-k would use the same watts to keep more cores active at a lower clock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can control absolute everyting on a z board.,"from highest clock frequency, to per load and per core clocks, to voltage, to power limits.","so you can make a 12900k as eficient as you need it to be, within your power and or thermal budget, 100mhz more or less vs a non k sku is irrelevant, as you can configure the boost manually.",i'm just saying k chips tend to be more efficient as they are better bins.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thank you very much for your patience.,we have not received reports of 12th gen intel core processors running outside of specifications due to changes to the integrated heat spreader (ihs).,our internal data show that the ihs on 12th gen desktop processors may have slight deflection after installation in the socket.,such minor deflection is expected and does not cause the processor to run outside of specifications.,we strongly recommend against any modifications to the socket or independent loading mechanism (ilm).,such modifications would result in the processor being run outside of specifications and may void any product warranties.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

how is a 10 degree c drop â€œshaving off a couple of câ€???,there is something fundamentally wrong with the mobo mount design when an aftermarket mod can cause a ten degree drop.,if you read the original article on washer mod youâ€™ll understand why this is happening to the rectangular alder lake chip and not with other square chips.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"no, no!",donâ€™t worry about the detail.,you are creating a useful data point for others who will come across this.,"so i do think your cpu package temps are running high, and frankly get a little bit too close to thermal throttling.",i suspect it may be a combination of both the lf2â€™s incongruent design with the al chip andâ€¦ you may also have a slightly weird chip.,"consider the following questions:

1.	can you kindly run cbr23 and tell me how it performs?","2.	secondly, you didnâ€™t answer the overclocking question, so you arenâ€™t running any overclocking correct?",3.	have you read the articles by igorâ€™s labs on washer mods and and ihs concavity?,4.	does the z690 force wi-fi have a foxconn socket or a lotes socket?,"just for the record, the numbers i have been posting are at an average 5.4ghz overclock on the p-cores (also, using asus ai oc where the mobo throws voltage like free candy!).",if you are running vanilla thenâ€¦ holy shit!!!,i donâ€™t mean to make light of the situation but those are some hot temps on a non-ocâ€™ed chip!!,even with the 420 lf2 you shouldnâ€™t be getting those temps.,"however, if the temps you are getting are ocâ€™ed temps then it is just a matter of using better cooling.",i have gone the full custom loop route.,i really ran out of patience with all these silly aios and their quirks with alder lake.,promise i am asking these questions for a reason; i have gone through 5 motherboards and have learnt a lot haha!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so cbr23 showed a score of 26794 and an almost static 84â°c.,as soon as test was over it dropped right back down to 26â°c.,"this, as well as all other data points shared, are without any oc which is why iâ€™m concerned.",that being said when running under load my avg is 5.2ghz but thatâ€™s just due to boost and not oc.,"i have read a majority of the igorâ€™s lab articles regarding alder lake chips including the ones you mentioned, however am extremely hesitant to attempt such solutions as the washer method because i really donâ€™t trust my competency with something like that.",a lot of threads on reddit (r/intel and others) suggested undervolting as a good way of correcting this.,i have no idea which type of socket but can definitely look into it.,i wasnâ€™t even aware mobos used different branded sockets until you asked that question and i did a bit of reading.,i do know that my socket temps have never gone above 50.9â°c and thatâ€™s including during the cbr23 test.,"i know, something is definitely up with the chip iâ€™m just hoping i can amend the problem without spending a shit ton more $$.",iâ€™m close to just saying fuck it and continuing on as normal and replacing cpu sooner down the line than i anticipated.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are absolutely correct and i will not recommend those mods if you donâ€™t feel comfortable.,"in fact those mods are not a must for everyone but in very few specific cases

so we started talking at a weird time.",we are up in our cabin in northern mn and i was working on my second 12900k build (well more like a complete rebuild).,i am going to go against a lot of the things i have said by stating what i learnt.,"so, fresh new processor, new z690 apex board, a new 3090 strix, and my old 420 lf2 (the original idea was to watercool this build as well since i have been so disappointed by aios).","however before installing the lf2 i ground down the edges of the mounting legs so that it lands down the vrm â€œvalleyâ€, on top of the cpu, with ease (the apex z690 literally has no space for the lf2 pump head, with the legs unmodified as they get blocked by the vrm, not allowing proper seating)

i put it all together but decided to test the build with the 420 lf2.","however, **as a rule i always install the backplate first before installing the processor**

i am absolutely blown away by the results:

-	i am running xmp 1 (6400mhz c32 2x16), rebar on, and cpu ocâ€™ed to 5.4ghz all p-core (really strong chip)
-	lf2 420 isâ€¦ surprisingly effective!!","considering my oc, i was expecting 90 throttle limit as usual but i sat at a four test avg.",of 75 cpu package temp.,and with an avg.,score of **29652**!,damn!,"i donâ€™t know what magic is happening but this is a really strong oc, yet the chip runs cooler.",can you believe that?,"this is an sp85 12900k, the other one is an sp88 one also.",weird right?,"anyway, your setup, even with a somewhat mid-range silicone should be, at least, 28.5k.",your score is too low.,"here is a potential solution for you: 

-	return the chip and get a new one (or rma the chip with intel who are surprisingly easy with their rmas.",my new chip is actually an rma they sent).,-	tighten up the backplate of your lf2; i donâ€™t know if the mounting â€œlegsâ€ are hitting the vrm in your case but if you think it is a tight fit because of the legs then filing them down is warranted.,"-	with the backplate installed, install the chip, use a soft small silicone spatula to spread your paste all over the ihs (you canâ€™t have â€œtoo muchâ€, but you can have â€œtoo littleâ€).",-	set your lf2 fans to run 100% by disconnecting the fans and independently routing their daisy chain (to a fan header).,"this way they will run the full 1700 rpm range (i have priced that when running through lf2, they max at 1300 rpm).",i have every confidence that you will be just fine.,my lf2 is the same one that i have been shitting on for the past one month but has now absolutely surprised me!,filing the legs worked!,my 4-test average scores and temps are better than the water cooled system!,hahaha!,"if you canâ€™t return the chip, rma it.",surprisingly easy.,"do the following:

-	engage intelâ€™s customer service on chat.","tell them that your chip has weird temp spikes, leading to system shutdowns.","-	tell them you have replaced the ram, the psu, the motherboard and even a different gpu.","-	tell them that even if idle, temp randomly ramps up leading to a shutdown or a â€œwatchdog clock timeoutâ€ error.","-	they will not ask any more questions, will ask you to send some pics of the chip and more than likely offer you a full cash refund (or you can ask for an â€œexpress advanced rmaâ€ by charging your credit card temporarily and sending you the chip before you send them yours).",let me know if you have any questions man.,"hopefully this helps :)

edit: when installing your aio, make sure you half-turn tighten the screws in an â€œxâ€ pattern.",this is very important as it allows even spread of the paste.,"edit 2: also, i do not have any of those igorâ€™s lab modifications; however my board has a lotes socket which is less likely to bend the ihs.",edit 3: corrected the avg.,temp above.,75 not 85.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

challenge, and it was fun.",you remember clue 1 so fondly because there were far fewer people around then and a lot of people didn't even expect the clue to be posted when it did.,of course a question with 1/10th the amount of competition is going to seem more casual and less of a race.,">after that, during the second session, where the hint was not coming, someone asked : ""is there a rate limiter ?","are we going to be disqualified if we get it wrong ?""","and the comm-manager in charge simply stated : ""no, there's no such thing.","you can guess however you like"" basically, an invitation to bots.","after that statement, the game was finished.","answers were brute-forced, and were generally guessed before any puzzle was out.","apart from one of the early clues that i mentioned earlier that intel gave too much of a hint in the answer prompt, only two others that i recall being guessed before the clue and only one of those was potentially a bot.",botting was not nearly as big of a problem as you seem to think.,> this instantly changed the nature of the game.,"instead of ""solve the puzzle"", the new game is : ""stay awake on the intel insider channel, wait for a leak, copy / paste it as fast as you can"".","this is, essentially, the best game you can invent for bots.",or you could solve the puzzles.,"i get that when people start to find the answer that it's not great to just dump the answer into the public channel, but it's still very possible to solve the clues before they are leaked.","> once it was clear that trying to guess the puzzle was a complete waste of opportunity, i also adjusted to the new unofficial rules: once the answer is posted, copy paste it as fast as you can.","say 2-3 seconds, top.","> in those few seconds, hundreds of answers have already poured in.","now, i can imagine many gamers being in the same case, but the exceptional performance of this stage let me wonder.","it has been steadily increasing question after question, to the point that it's not humanly possible to finish in the top 300 while remaining in ""human typing performance"" territory.","what can beat ""human typing performance"" ?","again, you are complaining that it's difficult to win without solving any of the clues yourself and relying on taking the answers once other people solve them and leak them.","i mean, obviously.",>intel's representative has already stated that there is no bot protection.,"what would prevent someone to setup a few dozens of bots, to 1) make them brute force the answer 2) get them to copy / paste the answer into dozens of fake accounts ?",this is not true.,they explicitly said that if they detect answers being entered too quickly or in the manner that a bot would they would disqualify it.,>that's essentially my problem here.,"we were invited to a long-run racing game, only to discover mid-course that actually, some competitors don't run, they use cars and planes.",imagine the new-york marathon won by a mercedes.,"would the other running competitor find it ""fair and square"" ?","again, botting was not really a big problem.","there was only one clue that was answered that was quick enough to be *potentially* a bot, but even then, it could still have been a person.",you are hugely overstating the potential botting problem and incorrectly insist that the only way to play was to not solve clues yourself and just copy other people's answers and expect to win.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just give up.,"there was a ""secret group"" that would always get the answers first.","by the time an answer reached the main communication group, the ranking was already in the 500+, so indeed no chance to reach the top 300. i've found it strange that always the same group would find all the answers first, sometimes in record time or even before the clue was posted, but hey, not a proof of insider knowledge

the guy telling you to ""find the answer yourself"" is a total jester.",less than < 5p did that.,everybody else got their answer from a group and copied it onto the board.,"you were either part of the ""priviledge"" group and had access first to the information, or you were not.","when not, you simply never stood a chance.",this is all there ever was.,"everything else, about ""heroic puzzle solving effort"" is just a smokescreen that those benefiting from the situation will noisily brand to give a taste of justification to their gains.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
only 3 questions were guessed before the clue was released.,question 3: because the question gave too much away.,"take ""author"" from the question and ""alchemist"" from keywords related to the contest, slap that together and put it in google, see what you find.",intel learned their lesson here pretty clearly if you look at the way the questions are worded after it.,question 7: one single person guessed it (perhaps a bot) and the answer was not disseminated to a single other person until the clue dropped.,"question 8: was pure brute force but released to the public chat as ""minecraft related"" because the answer was obsidian, the actual process of finding the answer had nothing to do with minecraft so i think its fair to say they simply landed on it by chance.","as the first person to have decoded the answer to question 10, i can assure you that the process of solving it did not involve brute forcing and was not particularly difficult.",question 4 was the most difficult in my opinion.,you can take a look at the intended process to answer each question here: https://imgur.com/a/h9asx77,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"aorus elite d4 here, there were xmp problem with the initial bios but was fixed with latest bios, as for nvme not being detected you need to add the intel rst/vmd driver at windows setup, or just simply disable intel-vmd in bios.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ok, i guess im picking it then.","i really liked the mobo, the connections and the design, but i saw a bunch of people saying it was shit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i always wanted to see this kind of testing, just feel like it's missing some info.","like a v/f curve, hardware duty cycling scaling, and core power in relation to package power.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i figured as much when trying to overclock this thing.,"from stock, every 100mhz all core means like 25-30w more power draw on a cinebench r23.",that like 15% power increase for 2% higher score.,"but every 100mhz when like gaming means like 3-5w, so it remains decently cool.","but when pushed, all power efficiency goes to hell.",literally.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

finally the superb article which lays down all important and interesting info.,shame they did not compare to zen 3 as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
reminds me of people getting better performance from undervolting their gpus instead of trying to overvolt and oc them.,or when i was ocing my ryzen 1600 and to go from 3.9 ghz to 3.925 ghz required a few extra voltage levels that increased power usage by 20-30 watts when running intel burn test.,"i never understood the fascination with trying to hit 5 ghz on cpus, which is right at the limit for silicon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the gaming efficiency mostly comes down to what he says in the article.,alder lake scales up a lot better.,games tend to be relatively light workloads that push the cpu to maximum speed well over what the most efficient speed would be.,so even if zen3 is extremely efficient at 3.5ghz it doesnâ€™t help much when the game runs at 4.8ghz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">however when you look at igor's review that looks at efficiency when gaming,

games depend heavily on gpu and use only some of the cores, so total load is moderate and power consumption lower.",">alder lakes efficiency thus seems very workload dependent

that's true for all cpus.",they become less efficient as you load them up more.,">and only test efficiency with a single workload, often something like cinebench, which in general is not the right play to test efficiency as efficiency can differ vastly between different workloads.","they're using cinebench to simulate heavy load, i.e.",worst case scenario efficiency.,"measuring worst case is not ""wrong"" or ""right"", but it is pretty useful to know since you want to size your heatsink and cooling for the biggest loads and not the smallest.","measuring idle power is also useful, and some reviews do that too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"tbf, igor turned on pbo for the ryzen cpus in this test.",wish he wouldve tested stock speeds as well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> is this not obvious?,"considering that in-game performance has zero dependence on e-core frequency, yes, this is not at all obvious that they push it so far and hurt efficiency.",intel never specified that e-cores are not efficient in k skus.,>who do they think buys k skus?,oh so you can then explain why 12900 has 8 e-cores and anything below it has 4?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the die is much smaller than the ihs.,"in fact for alder lake the die to ihs ratio is smaller than before (ihs size increased while die size decreased), this was done because raptor lake will grow the die size, so that's why they made the ihs bigger, in preparation for 13th gen.

anyways, to get to the point, you don't need full ihs coverage from your cooler, it's beneficial, but only something you really need to think about with the 12900k, the other cpus in the lineup don't use as much power or get as hot, and are perfectly fine with only partial coverage, assuming the cooler is good to begin with",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's another thing.,"in this particular case, the cooler is big enough to provide proper heat transfer.","but in general that's not true, and it's probably related to how the actual cpu die is displaced under the ihs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is probably the other way around.,"if the cooler already gets fully saturated, then a bigger contact area doesn't matter, since it isn't able to disperse more heat anyway.","but if the cooler has more headroom, then a bigger contact area with the ihs would decrease temperatures.","as long as the die area is fully covered in both examples, of course.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"really interesting, thx ðÿ‘œ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what cooler are you using to get 40c in cinebench?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"im guessing the asus board is automatically raising the base voltage based on your overclock, hence the high voltages.",not necessarily a silicon lottery loser or anything you cant deal with.,"try changing the ""voltage merthod"" (unsure of asus' wording) to ""override"" instead of ""offset""

then set the override to 1.35v, llc towards the low end (less is better for stability; it might seem that you dont want vdroop, and thats true, but the behind the scenes is that without vdroop, you have voltage drops software doesnt see that can cause instability)

right now on my 12700k, i'm running adaptive+offset with a base voltage of 1.4v and llc 7 (msi has 1 thru 8 with 8 being the lowest).","with vdroop under cinebench, it drops to 1.26v.","all core turbo is 51x 

adaptive mode means that when idle, core voltages drop rather than staying constant.",might help with reducing degradation over time.,"first thing first though, figure things out without using adaptive mode.",this just adds complexity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you might just have a poor silicon lottery luck.,what sp rating does your motherboard say since you have an asus board?,i can comfortably run a -.1v offset on my 12700k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
should use hwinfo64 instead of hwmonitor.,there is no scenario in which you will see 40deg at 1.356v and 100deg at 1.4v for the same test.,you are likely looking at vid instead of vcore which will be much lower at llc3.,i don't know why offset voltages aren't working to such a major degree.,"it's possible that the voltage offset only applies to the factory-fused v-f points and hence doesn't work for turbo frequencies higher than the stock single-core boost, but i don't think that's the case.",in any case i think you are skipping steps and leaving too many variables uncontrolled by jumping right to an adaptive turbo.,"here is what i would recommend doing to get a feel for your chip's performance: you should try setting up some fixed frequency all-core overclocks with override voltages - for example, 4.8 all-core at 1.325v vcore with llc3.","run cinebench and note the wattage, hwinfo64 vcore readout, and temperatures.",this should be much more similar to your stock performance.,"do that for some other voltages at the same frequency to establish a reference for how temperature/power will scale with voltage, and then start trying other frequencies to establish how frequency can scale with voltage.","after doing that, if you desire to have high single-core boosts rather than a fixed all-core ratio, you can use the info you've learned about your chip to set up a per-core boost with an adaptive voltage.",this doesn't really answer your question about why voltage offset isn't working but it will address the problem of your oc overheating.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you expect to overclock it while undervolting it?,i don't think that will work bro.,\-offset only works at stock.,if you want to oc with per core usage you need adaptive voltage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you looking at vcore or vid?,"because 1.35v ""stock"" doesn't seem normal with vdroop under load.","fuse voltage at all core 4.9 should be around 1.30v i guess,  i think it's around there for mine, and after vdroop on llc3 it should be around 1.27v ish, depending on the acll.",nothing you say adds up really.,"40c stock, just 200mhz more and suddenly you are at 100c.",what's the actual package wattage being pulled at stock and then at 4.9?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i had a similiar problem with the high voltage, then i had to go into bios and stopped it from doing it's oc thing, i think it was conflicting with intel xtu.",occasinally i would see undefined as voltage in the intel xtu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just leave turbo on automatic, get a great cooling solution.",install intel xtu and set the turbo time to 128 seconds.,donâ€™t change anything else.,that jargon you wrote shows youâ€™ll be buying a new cpu soon.,"you need 5v for your cpu, 1.4 turbo for logic gates, 1.0 for integrated gpu, and 3.0 for ports.",the voltage fluctuates between components.,why are you messing with that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the goal wasn't to undervolt anything.,the problem i'm having is that my motherboard seems to be automatically pushing the voltage too high causing excessive heat.,"i was attempting to use the core voltage offset to control that a little bit, to take it from 1.4v+ to 1.375v or so.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

here are the logs from hwinfo.",i don't know what i was looking at last night but 40c was not accurate.,it didn't make much sense to me either but maybe it was a hwmonitor bug.,either way i'm using the better tool now at the advice of u/iwantbegoodattennis.,"the numbers make a lot more sense now though, seeing as the wattage was much higher on the oc than stock.",i guess i have some tuning to do now.,some people are recommending setting the voltage manually to like 1.30-1.35 and trying again so i guess i'll give that a shot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this.,once i got out of intel xtu and manually adjusted in bios it played nice.,odd too cause i was having same issues on an msi board.,"op you need to use multiple softwares to load test the cpu, its how i figured out i was only testing 1 core even though software was reporting back false info.",wattage was easy to watch for and using intel xtu to make a  minor change or two and then going to bios- otherwise software is finicky,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i don't believe for a second that you are getting 25c over ambient in cinebench with anything less than a multirad custom loop.,something isn't right.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"looking at this it makes perfect sense, 1.35+ vcore under load is extremely high (12600k at 5.0 p-cores should need in the 1.2-1.25 range) so that's causing a lot of extra heat.",motherboard must be setting voltage too high on auto settings.,just have to manually set the voltage + llc to a more reasonable value and it should work out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the only reason it revs up loud at 75 degrees is because the bios has automatically selected it to be at that rpm at that temperature.,you can either manually adjust the fan curve yourself so that it spins slower at higher temperatures if you want to be a daredevil with the temperatures or you can get a better after market cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"oh yeah they probably are, but since the post was about the pentium, i was just referring to the historic reason why it was a ""pentium"" instead of a ""586"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm having a hard time finding a specific article to link so this is my recollection of the story.,"i'm sure i got a few details wrong, so people are welcome to correct me.","edit:  found this article:  https://www.vice.com/en/article/bj85g3/why-intel-couldnt-trademark-numbers-anymore

anyway, my recollection:

way back when intel was starting getting into cpus, they sold processors to ibm who required that the cpu design come from two different suppliers, so intel licensed the design to amd for the 8088, 8086, and the 80286 (the ""286"") and they called them the amd 8088, and the amd 80286, or am286.","so intel designed the cpu, and then licensed it to amd who manufactured it and both companies used the same name because the design was identical.","but when the 386 design came out, intel refused to license it to amd which resulted in a court battle for breach of contract (which amd later won).","in the meantime, amd reverse-engineered the 386 and launched it under the name 386, but intel tried to block amd from calling that but a judge ruled the numbers too generic to be trademarked.","with the 486, intel, amd, and cyrix all launched 486 cpu's but when the time for the 586 came out, intel branded their version the ""pentium cpu"" (""pent"" for 5) to which they now owned the trademark.","amd came out with the amd 5x86 - i owned one and it overclocked like a champ, i had my 5x86-133 running at 200mhz and felt like a boss... but it was actually a 486 generation design.","amd labelled the 5x86 cpus as to how they compared to the pentium by calling them things like the ""amd 5x86-p75"" to indicate that it had comparable performance to a 75mhz pentium.","soon after that amd dropped the -86 part of the name and called their next design the ""k5"" - ""k"" for kryptonite which was an amusing jab.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd expect them to take issue with amd's chipset naming.,they're being trolled hard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ibm pc would be relic by 1992, 486s were in then.",i think youâ€™re off by a decade!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was also jelly of the amber folks haha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"this was a really cool read, thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe it was.,i think it was a ps/2 model.,my mother thought everything should hold it's value.,"they had a projection screen tv that was real expensive in 1982, she was mad at my dad when he sold it for $300.","she kept her console tv for nearly 30 years, color tv, it was particularly b&w by the time she got rid of it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yup ps/2 would be in the right decade in the '90s.,"i actually wrote financial software for os/2 in c++  the late '90s - ps/2 did get popular in the financial industry, that's about it :-)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i think you must apply very little mounting pressure, i saw somebody with same issue",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you remount the hardware or just the block?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you check the contact i.e.,thermal paste spread?,you have the right bracket?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
block and applied more thermalpaste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it was the thermal paste it wasnt even makeing contact went from idling 70-85 to 40c now =d xd,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"at least i can fairly confidently say my 12900kf is cooled properly, i get around 30-35c idle with air cooling.",i've been super worried about my cpu bending.,still don't really know if it's something i need to worry about.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
awesome glad it works,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, probably motherboard, but what i would try:

find a bios setting that tells cpu *not* to turbo when booting.","set your os power plan to balanced, not performance.","also, maybe boot linux usb and see if that survives?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your motherboard probably can't get it stable.,i have the same kit and it had no headroom on the gigabyte z690 aorus master.,"i switched to the msi z690 unify-x, which only has 2 dimm slots, and it is actually able to overclock.","this kit has very aggressive timings and it uses samsung ics, so it is more difficult to drive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you may just have a bum board.,my first z690 ddr4 board died after 3 days.,computer store i deal with locally has rma'd several msi and asus boards.,glad i went with ddr4 for now.,did you buy the power supply at the same time as these new parts?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had a very similar issue with a 12900k that you are experiencing mine ended up being a bad cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ideally, more information is needed as you do not even clarify whether you are running 2 dimm or 4 dimm, is there a riser cable, temps ( although i assume they are fine as ooct is noting as passing ).","also, the system shutting down randomly would not be a reason to arbitrarily update the uefi?","this would indicate a number of other factors at play that first should be assessed including surge, spike, sag, brownout or ovp/ocp issue, oc instability, or thermal issue.",that being noted.,"in these types of cases, you need to go step by step and simply.","are damaged in the socket and the pad is clean ( under the cpu )u )

1. load uefi defaults not xmp or any modified behavior including mce so disable it and select force intel defaults   

2. reconfirm your memory at base value via the integrated memory test in the uefi    

3. remove the gpu and use the igpu   

4. check your system with a clean os install and no other applications or service installed outside of core drivers.","i would ideally secure erase your drive prior to the os install as well

assuming the memtest passes and secure erase and os go smoothly proceed to run occt on cpu, dram, psu and see if they all pass.",if they do proceed to reinstall the gpu and then recheck and include the gpu.,if you run into an issue depending on the fault consider an rma for that component as it looks like you have helped to validate other components.,if you want further help consider joining our [pcdiy group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/asuspcdiy) or follow up with a formal rma.,hope this helps and best of luck.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it sounds like a power delivery problem, but since you switched psus and the computer runs stably during load for some reason, the only thing left is maybe the motherboard having issues with power delivery.",have you tried turning off all boost/c states and running the cpu at a static frequency?,"at this point, though, may as well swap the motherboard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"honestly, all thatâ€™s left at this point is the motherboard.",especially for such a severe issue - this isnâ€™t some random hiccup that comes around one a week and is nigh impossible to trace.,"i really think youâ€™ve done your due diligence on every other component and, even with it working fine for a tech once, that doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s actually okay all the time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
had a nearly identical problem with ddr4 asus board.,"after days of troubleshooting, i was convinced i had a faulty mobo.","ultimately it was the board not properly controlling the voltages for the ram, manually set ivr transmitter vddq voltage, vccsa, dram voltages as the controller ""auto"" setting was putting voltages all over the place rapidly.","i don't know exactly how that translates from ddr4 -> 5, but worth a shot.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looking forward to hear from you how that ended.,i have ordered corsair 6200 cl36 (sk hinyx m) and nor sure what to do.. i have 14 days return period started now.,i still need order motherboard.,was thinking about apex or extreme from asus..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tried the power plan and turning off c-states no luck,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i had a 5200 micron kit, with or without xmp both sticks are doing it :( lowering clocks dont change anything :/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i built my buddies system and msi z690 ddr4 died after 2 weeks.,i wonder what is going on with these boards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's what i thought, that's why i bought a cheap alder lake celeron and still does the same.","hope to god i get this board sorted, losing my mind messing with it haha",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the z690 apex is a 2 dimm board so thought i didn't need to say.,i forgot to add that i tried every bios version.,uefi defaults/xmp both of them still crash and don't last at all.,i tried another gpu and still does it.,also when i try without a gpu i got a vga light because the apex doesn't have any display io.,i tried 2 different drives with windows 10 on them and same issue.,its not windows related because it still boot loops/crashes in bios without a single drive even installed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've tried all of it bro!,"if the board cant stably power a celeron g6900, its done haha!",so stressed with all this haha!,had a nightmare from day 1 from pre ordering my i9.,"i pre ordered my i9 as soon as we could, it got cancelled on release day, re ordered from elsewhere just to find out its not in stock about a week after ordering and then waiting a week for a refund... ordered again and courier delivered it to a house 10 miles away just for the homeowner to say ""they never had anything"" even though the driver left a image of the parcel being left in the shed in the back garden had to wait about 2 weeks to get my money back and now i have it, i get all these problems!!",worst part is i told my mates this is fate telling me not to get this platform,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my board went back today so can't test but if they say ""its fine"" and send it back ill give it a go",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it was my motherboard... finally they diagnosed it properly after rmaing it the 2nd time!,should be getting a replacement anytime now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i tend to use coretemp a lot to check out new hardware and i definitely noticed the msi was consistently running the 12900k at a hired vid than the gigabyte z690 ud... msi i think was turboing a little more aggressively.,definitely not buying another msi any time soon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i bet you are hopefully you get it resolved soon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
temps are perfectly fine at around 30 in bios.,i haven't oced anything at all either as i haven't even been able to use the actual thing long enough!,the socket also has no bent pins.,"the pad is fine, also i've tried 2 cpu's.","everything in the system has been tried with something else known to work or replaced, i've tried 2 new ram kits and 2 new cpu's, 4 different psu's, different ssd's/without ssd, 2 gpu's and as i'm typing this my 3080 is in my old build and is perfectly working and just got off playing games for almost 5 hours without a single crash/error.",literally every component has been tried with another known to work one or a completely new one.,only thing that hasn't been swapped out is the board,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah that's pretty bad luck, but from the looks of it, if swapping out literally everything still doesn't work it and a completely different computer works in the same outlet seems like its gotta be the motherboard.",can't imagine every part going bad like this.,might have to argue with the manufacturer but hopefully they take the board back after jumping through so many hoops trying to rule out everything else.,if support won't help you ask them to escalate it or look for their twitter account and complain there.,bad press ain't worth one motherboard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hopefully they just send you a new board and it fixes all the issues, check the asus forums for the new z690 boards, unfortunately issues like this aren't isolated - seems to be fairly widespread across both ddr4/ddr5 z690",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"consider joining our asus pcdiy group -  


that being noted it very much depends on what your oc settings are are you targeting the popular but inefficient all-core oc approach or better per core tuning approach.",per core tuning will maxm9ze frequency and also be more thermally efficient.,"avx is fairly irrelevant unless you are using your system for professional applications, as such you should not limit your oc based on synthetic stress tests as you limit your scaling, this is even more critical considering you are using an air cooler.",i would estimate if you have a decent cpu relative to silicon variance you should see per core scaling on low core count between 5.1 to 5.2 from there this will scale down based on the number of cores.,"the vrm is fine in handling the load but as i  noted load is dependent on how you test and what you run you want lower temps, longer lifespan and better efficiency per core with an adaptive voltage is your friend.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i initially installed windows 10 and then upgraded to windows 11 (using microsoft's windows 11 installation assistant) in order to transfer my win 10 pro license key over to win 11. you should be on windows 11 if you intend to use the e-cores of your processor on a daily basis.,the new scheduler is much smarter.,i'm not going back to windows 10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
apparently this is due to handbrake deciding usually to do low process priority for some reason?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is it worth upgrading from 10900k to 12900k.?,i am also thinking but on the other hand the asus motherboard issue on z690 chipset i heard they are getting fried because of wrong ram placement thing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"new chromium edge doesnt support playready like old edge does on hd4000 laptops, hence why ill never update my win10",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

* when i built the system in 2015 windows 10 was just out and an unknown, and windows 8/8.1 sucked, so i stuck with 7 as a safe bet.",* i hate reinstalling windows and wasnâ€™t sure i was going to trust an upgrade on that system.,"* my backup solution (an old windows home server) was never updated to support windows 8 or 10, so i would lose a very capable file versioning / bare metal restore / dedeuplicated file system, thatâ€™s actually still hard to replace with as much convenient functionality today - so i kinda felt held back.","at any rate i needed to build a new system and windows 7 is long dead, so i had to suck it up and go with windows 11. backup is now migrated to a synology app.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i probably cany remove limits,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can also slighty undervolt via in the bios and gain a little head room if it's power limited but 4.2ghz is the max all core boost underload.,if the load is heavy enough that it drops below 4.2ghz in some spots undervolting may help.,otherwise enjoy the 4.2ghz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you sort of need to accept the fact that i9 is a **very hot chip**.,every i9 out there are usually super hot (obviously because of how powerful it is).,mobo's nowadays do better making heatsinks to handle extremely hot cpu well.,"if i remember correctly, there are several people that reach 90c-100c when benchmark testing i9 chips and it was completely fine.",that's only if the chip was used at max load (which would be highly unlikely unless you do a lot of video/graphic work).,you can try getting a stronger cooler and that may help.,don't forget that intel did say that 100c is fine for i9 chips also but it's really up to the motherboard if it can handle that type of heat in the long run.,you should definitely be getting a stronger cooler though.,ek aio 240 is really a cheap pick compare to one of the strongest and expensive chip you chose.,"don't forget that if you decide to go for the highest end part in a build, the other parts should be on par.",it's not good to have a high end piece in one part but a mediocre piece that supports it.,you won't be able to reach full potential that way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

so i dropped my pl1/pl2 to 125w and im able to get 85c and not have any of my cores hit 100c.,still getting 22000 cinebench score without any crashes.,this is by far the best advice if someone is gonna air cool or use a smaller aio,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea i messed up in picking this part cause i thought the only cooler that would fit in the nr200p was the 240 but i just found out that the 280 will fit in this case.,might have to do a returnâ€¦.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not true actually.,"my u12a easily handle the 12900k, 77c peak on stock cbr23 10 minute stress test.",right now imrunning 5.6ghz on st and 5.3-5.2ghz on all core.,"it's one of the coolest cpus ive ever had, so yeah.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a 3080ti and i dont think i can mount a 280mm radiator on the bottom.,as per cooler masters website a 280mm can only be done on the side.,im stuck with a 240mm radiator on the bottom orientation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea they are ramping up.,very loud tbh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
undervolt!!,!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
youâ€™d have to read reviews to see how much better it actually performs.,"at minimum it has 36% more surface area, which isnâ€™t insignificant, and puts it only 10% less than a 360.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
however i checked again and a 280mm will only fit in a side orientation which will interfere with my vertically mounted 3080ti.,im stuck using a 240mm radiator bottom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well you shouldn't use the ek on the bottom, that will let air into the pump.",i have the arctic on the side w/ a 3090.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you probably shouldn't use the ek aio with bottom rad.,"side mounting the radiator gives optimal cooling for both the gpu and cpu, since the gpu a bit airflow is restricted when vertical afaik.","the ek is a pump in block aio so it will probably cause problems for the pump, so bottom rad is not optimal in that case.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so i tried undervolting to 50mv and it was not stableâ€¦.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s highly suggested not to put the aio on the bottom of your case,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep.,i just got the ek 280 elite.,bottom mounted the gpu (broke the damn gpu tab) and was able to fit the 280mm radiator with 4 fans in push/pull config!,temps r much better (now in the high 80â€™s).,still went ahead and dropped the watts to 125/125 for pl1/pl2 and temps r now in the 60â€™s,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how did you apply the offset?,what llc level are you on?,what is your base voltage?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unfortunately thats the design of the case.,it will fit side or bottom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
jayztwocents is one of the least reliable tech youtubers imo.,i had to stop watching him long ago when he was constantly spreading wrong information.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i thought this was common knowledge, that channel is funny ngl.","btw the issue is bizzare, considering how long the lga socket has been in use.","i mean, those are the engineering basics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's funny because his name is literally jayz two cents and that's because he throws his two cents into everything and gets it wrong most of the time.,he is always shooting from the hip this guy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this is far from first time jayztwocents got something wrong, watch him only for entertainment, keep everything else he says with a massive pinch of salt.",if you want actual decent reporting check gamers nexus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what are some things heâ€™s gotten wrong in terms of misinformation spreading?,i know of him but iâ€™d like to have some more info other than bandwagoning.,i donâ€™t really care about it but examples are good so people donâ€™t blindly believe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ve got a 12900kf and a z690 msi tomahawk on its way in the mail.,iâ€™m planning to mount an arctic liquid ii freezer with the lga 1700 mounting kit.,is there anything i need to be aware of in terms of installing the cpu in the motherboard and/or adding the cooler?,different from the usual that is (not screwing the cooler in to tight etc.),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
each pin in the lga 1700 socket needs a certain amount of pressure.,times that by the amount of pins quickly adds up to around 85kg.,if you stood on your cpu would it bend.,thats what the problem sounds like.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how the fuck did some motherboard manufacturers not get the socket pressure correct???,how is that even possible for companies that have been making this shit for decades?,now i believe the people who are saying qa has gone down the drain for all tech over the last few years.,this is fucking disgraceful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so based on this info, is there certain motherboards we should avoid that causes this issue?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the reply.,iâ€™ll do a regular install and cross my fingers.,"a washer mod would void my 2 year warranty, so i wouldnâ€™t do that",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
he also seems to imply several times that the reason you don't want thicker washers is because the bracket will be too high causing the cooling plate to not contact the ihs well.,the actual reason you don't want thick washers is because the pins can lose sufficient contact with the pads.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
he has a high iq,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would also like to add that his custom pc builds isnt that impressive like he wants you to believe.,the destiny and starwars theme build looks exactly the same and kinda amateurish haha.,"he is funny tho, but like linus tech tips, its more like infotainment.",just my 2 cents,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"he really did, and unfortunately people just seem to be going along with it.",not the first time and of course not the last.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
jayz2cents from way back is the one i subbed for.,"doing tutorials and explanation to newbies in the hobby, or doing some stupid (and entertaining) shit is cool to watch.","but nowadays he just do product showcases m  clickbait content, and occasional misinfornation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
jay sucks.,had to stop watching him 2-3 years ago.,shocked he still has a following.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nah.,thereâ€™s no way the latch mechanism is exerting enough force to bend anything.,itâ€™s just not possible where the latch contacts the cpu.,iâ€™ll die on this sword.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
used to love jay's content but he kept getting everything wrong and accidentally stoking flames when he's out of his element.,"if i want liquid cooling tips, i'll watch his vids.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i commented on the exact same thing on his video, he ignored it and has moved on to another rant in which he displays minimal technical knowledge of.","i only subscribe to christopher flannigan and buildzoid, they actually know their shit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this whole bending issue is making me want to upgrade to the 10th or 11th gen instead of the 12th one just to stay on safe side and have a peace of mind.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is a spectrum from high quality tech reporting to infotainment.,jay z is firmly in the infotainment part of that spectrum.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
kinda same.,"which is a shame, he had some really cool vids over the years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
one of the first videos of his i ever saw had him guessing and speculating on information that had been known for 18 months and was regularly discussed on /r/hardware.,i can't for the life of me recall what it was but i dont' even religiously follow this stuff anymore.,"if i know more than him without trying, yeah i'm out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
he is a nice refreshing â€˜average joe plays with computersâ€™ as compared to the savagely analytical overview that other channels provide.,sometimes its just easier on the brain after a long day at work to hear someone who is excited about computers rather than listening to someone who makes it sound like the sky is falling down because a cpu delivers 3% worse frame times than its rival.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can i get a rundown of his misinfo?,i had always thought he was a good source.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i only watch him for his pc case mods.,"i like that..

the rest?",.. not so much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
he's a burned out mouthpiece for corpos that has other interests.,dude just wants to game and overspend on automotives.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ha!,if you said this on twitter you'd be barraged by his fangays.,i notice he spread wrong informstion quite early and really despise his arrogance on twitter too.,when i (and some other people) said that on twitter though we were ambushed lol.,i cant remember what was the topic but it was quite controversial.,probably the single vs dual channel and single rank vs dual rank vs quad rank memory back when people found out dual rank dual channel on ryzen does yield better results.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, and i always thought that lga bracket pressure on intel cpus was always way to tight.","not sure if it needed that much pressure, you need the power of almighty thor himself to push that thing in place just to hold cpu in place firmly enough and then add more pressure with cpu cooler on top.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is why i stopped watching him.,outside of water cooling he doesnâ€™t know anything about computers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the tech steves (gn and hb) are excellent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"\+1 for american steve and down under steve as well :)

ps: gpu shunt ""soldering"" killed me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah honestly his misguided information with regard to the new world ""related"" gpu failure was one reason i kicked off my own publication, others are as bad or worse but i agree 100%.",i feel more and more content is about getting viewers or getting them riled up than actually informing them.,"gamers nexus is top-notch, i regularly and happily link out to their content.",they clearly put a lot of thought and effort into their publication.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a few that i remember off the top of my head are:

when he used the sound of high voltage power lines as an example of the electrical noise that filtering capacitors are designed to filter out, which of course doesn't make sense at all.","when he implied that you could use ddr4 in a ddr5 motherboard, which is obviously not possible for several reasons.","when he, on a few occasions, kept claiming that a 'voltage spike' was causing potential vrm failures in gpus when what he was actually seemingly talking about was a **current** spike, not a voltage spike.","those are just the few that i can think of right away, i'm sure there's plenty more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
one thing that stood out to me was when he said ryzen processors didn't have avx circa 2019-2020 when zen2 was current gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i wish i could tell you, these things usually just work... unless when they don't.","best thing you could do, i would, is to put the cpu in the socket, lock it down with the latch and before thermal paste and cooler, try to see if the cpu is bent.",maybe put something really straight (short side of a ruler maybe) on top of it - lenghtwise - and try to see if it lines up with the ihs.,"if it does, you're probably good to go.","maybe after awhile it'll get bent tho, but who knows.","if it's not straight and cpu is bent, maybe then try washer mods.",i would not do the mod without somehow checking if the cpu is bent in the first place.,"and please be careful and gentle with everything :d  


edit: if you do washer mod - read everything about it first - buildzoid, igor's labs etc, also - try to use plastic or silicone washers that are rated for high temps.",metal ones can damage your board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's messed up.,i'm always sweating when clamping down lga brackets - it just feels unnatural how much force you need to exert on the lever to latch it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're thinking to much about this.,intel gives them a range of spec.,if they exceeded that range then it's the oem fault.,if the pressure is in the high range of the spec then intel is at fault.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i cant do steve at gn, just too much information to be honest.",i know that sounds weird but the guy is a genius and goes through every bit of tech with a fine tooth comb which is awesome but i cant sit through a 30min video about a graphics card and its 400 benchmarks that the first 5 benchmarks already showed.,it gets boring and dry quickly.,he does amazing work just a little too far to the other end.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you haven't.,all you did was confirm my main point then add another possibility that intel is at fault.,how exactly does that explain i over thought things?,"ironic you link a reading comprehension test, coming from you.","but if you want to continue to not actually explain yourself, that's up to do, and it's also up to you to pretend like others have poor reading comprehension.",just don't be surprised by down votes and/or getting banned in the future.,"edit: and for everyone else following, he thinks me claiming qa went down the drain is ""thinking too much"" about it.","no, if you're either a motherboard manufacturer or intel that has been making essentially the same thing for decades (and we've already had long hedt and server cpus before), and you fuck up any part of your motherboard this bad at this stage in your company's history, your qa went down the drain.",period.,"that is literally a fact; it isn't overthinking, it's just true.","and yes, it's disgraceful.","these are products a company spends literally half a year or more perfecting, that will be used by millions of customers, and they already have experience with the same exact form factor cpus.",it is almost impossible for something like this to happen unless you stopped giving a fuck about testing the motherboards you just spent months validating.,"aka your qa was absent for the affected models, and still possibly absent for the other models that happened to not be affected.",i primarily didn't blame intel because they're far less likely to be the reason this happened.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"correct, which is what i said before.",didn't say anything about it being a freak accident.,the only thing vendors are testing is they bios/component selection.,i guarantee you it's 99% intels responsibility to provide the physical specifications.,it's certainly within the bounds of reason that it's a limited issue.,different cooler weights and pressure distribution could absolutely be contributing to it.,something that may never have came up if intel only used stock or a specfic type of aftermarket cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if it's for a very small time, you could set your fan speed to change once very few refreshes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at what point does it spike?,could be unpacking textures/assets.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i am pretty sure it has nothing to do with thermal paste, cooling solution or oc because i have the same issue with a 9700k and i found a few more forum posts about that in combination with the same cpu.",but its nothing to worry about as long as temperatures dont stay that high for long.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had this same issue on my asus board.,"the cpu temps spiking is normal operation for those cpus, but the fans going from 20% to 100% rapidly was indeed super annoying.","at the time, i just set my fans to a max speed of 50%, which was fine for gaming loads.","my new gigabyte board has better bios control on the fans, which makes them ramp up slowly, so the spikes don't cause wild fluctuations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this has nothing to do with intel, the h115i or the motherboard and 100% is caused by how you have the case fan control setup.",consult the documentation on your motherboard and try some alternative configuration.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bursty all-core workloads (especially those that use avx) can lead to temperature spikes.,"either set a current limit in the bios to avoid these workloads producing too much heat, or just adjust the fan hysteresis to keep them from reacting to this spike.","with coffee lake, you should be good with a current limit of 20-30a per core, so 160-240 in your case.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
check your bios configuration to set the fans on your desired profile.,also make sure you connected your case fans to the correct fan connectors on the mobo.,i once had someone put their case fan in a cpu fan connector.,he was very confused as to why the wrong fan was ramping up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
llc maybe?,voltage spike as the load drops?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you tried re paste and reseating the cooler?,could be a mounting issue causing the spike,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your fans are using the cpu temp sensor?,run them off coolant temp ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it sounds like you have your fans profile to read cpu temp sensor.,if you are running an aio you need to set it to read off coolant temp or some other sensor.,have you got the mini usb plugged into the pump for corsair link?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did that already.,but i think motherboard or intel overwrites what i choose and runs the fans 100% because they think the cpu is going to burn.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it spikes when i return back to the lobby screen after a game finishes.,fps drops to 40 in this menu screen.,in a match fps is 130-200.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
randomly spiking fans are very annoying.,i am trying to determine whether to keep my cooler and possibly not purchase another asus motherboard when i upgrade to 12700k.,if the fault is with the cpu i wonder if the same thing will happen with the 12th gen. i just want to make sure that i am blaming the correct part.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am using the asus software for fan profiles.,and mb overwrites them.,are you saying bios might have different options than the software?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
both bios and asus software blocking me to adjust the curve beyond 75c.,at and after 75c fans work at 100% power.,all of my fans pwm.,is there a way to adjust the curve beyond 75c?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i tried this more than 10 times in 4 years of ownership.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unfortunately asus bios doesn't allow this.,i installed 3rd party software to solve the problem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i unfortunately have never gotten this problem/never noticed this problem with my asus boards.,i've dug a little bit in the rog forums and found someone saying you could change critical temperature.,"however the behaviour above critical temperature will remain the same, i assume you could set this higher and adjust your fan curve so that your temps remain under control without it blowing to its max.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you have your pump running at decent speeds all the time?,delay between the pump and fans speeding up might be enough time for a hotspot to hit 90c for a second before cooling back down to normal temps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my best guess is that there is some scene with very high fps or/and very high cpu usage which cause the temp spike.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's ultimately the fan controllers fault (asus)

msi boards have a (user variable) ramp up and ramp down time, so while the system would go ""oh shit 100% fan now!!!!""",the motherboard only lets the speed rise a few percent per second.,i'm surprised asus doesn't have something similar.,check the bios fan control options,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the asus fan software is garbage.,set them up in bios.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
check out the asus bios.,"[https://www.techpowerup.com/review/asus-rog-maximus-z690-hero/images/bios67.jpg](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/asus-rog-maximus-z690-hero/images/bios67.jpg)

there is a feature called q-fan.","i recall if you have 3-pin or 4-pin connectors connected to the motherboard, it will detect those fans.","you can even plug in your aio fan and pump to the motherboard, but corsair has it's own fan/pump controller settings etc.",q-fan has a fan ramp up feature that will prevent the fan from spinning if it is unnecessary.,minimum is like 12 seconds before the fans kick on.,that might help.,"source image: 

https://www.techpowerup.com/review/asus-rog-maximus-z690-hero/5.html#5-5",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i donâ€™t understand.,my asus board lets me do this.. i think you have your fans plugged into the wrong headers or something.,corsair icue should allow you to do this no problem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i looked this up for hours.,i read those posts.,many people are complaining that asus doesn't allow to change the 75c critical temp limit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes pump is at 100% at all times.,spike to 90c and back down to 60s is instant.,i can't see happening live.,i only saw it reported in the hardware monitor software as max cpu temp once i hear the fans ramp up 100%.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if i remeber correctly asus also has something like that.,i have seen fan smoothing for amd sockets so i think there should be similar for intel sockets too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
both bios and asus software blocking me to adjust the curve beyond 75c.,at and after 75c fans work at 100% power.,all of my fans pwm.,is there a way to adjust the curve beyond 75c?,i need to block it from going 100% power until temp reaches 90c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it seems like other people like myself are complaining.,asus suck.,people are complaining about the 75c limit past 5 years.,asus doesn't respond in the forums or at all.,i guess i am stuck.,never asus again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then unfortunately i'd suggest either finding a illegitimate update for your bios that unlocks this feature (rather not) or to invest in some new cooling equipment.,"i recommend the latter, since it will greatly benefit your hardware and ambient noise, but i understand that you wouldn't want to buy more stuff.","heck, i rolled with a stock cooler from intel for a long time and only upgraded it with a small bequiet cpu cooler.",it was only when i built my new pc that i invested more money in cooling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"weird, full pump should give you a decent amount of soak time instead of spiking.",i remember my 9700k being pretty easy to cool even with full avx2 stress tests.,mine maxed out at about 150w after oc and stayed around 80c~.,might be an issue with the 9700k itself instead of the rest of your build.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your mistake is running case fans off of cpu temps.,"the h115 will handle that, run the case fans off some other sensor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have been using this system for 4 years.,i don't think i will change anything.,i will probably buy a new system soon and will never buy an asus motherboard again.,this is ridiculous.,i don't know why more people are not complaining about this artificially created problem.,all other motherboard manufacturers allow fan curves beyond 75c but not asus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have never heard of this.,can you direct me to more information?,i thought all fans were following the cpu temp.,what other sensors can they follow?,h115 is not handling the 2 cpu fans in my setup.,i directly connected the 2 fans to cpu\_fan and cpu\_fan\_optional to control them myself.,h115 pump cable header is connected to the aio\_pump header.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think it's fair that they put it there.,but they should allow it to be unlocked more easily.,just make sure your cooling solution is good.,"since every motherboard manufacturer has their pros and cons, i wouldn't say don't buy asus anymore.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, you can configure which system sensor each fan header is responding to.","i used to have the z270 and had mine setup this way, but it's been so long i couldn't tell you exactly how from memory.",you'll have to check the manual.,and the fan headers on the h115i are your best choice since it controls them based on water temperature instead of cpu temperature.,"the limit of a water coolers performance is not the fan speed, it's the thermal conductivity of the cpu block.",want to know for sure?,"start a cpu load, and as soon as your cpu temps settle, unplug your radiator fans.","it takes minutes for the temps to increase, not seconds.",that's why the fans don't jump up and down when you have them properly connected to the cooler.,"with everything setup the way you are, all you're doing is making the system incredibly loud with practically no benefit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
280 mm h115i pro xt is not enough for 9700k?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think the cooler itself is fine, but i have no clue how you have set it up and the rest of the build.","for all we know, there is slightly too little liquid in the cooler and has dry hits (if that is even possible).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i really wish settings could be maintained between bios upgrades.,iâ€™ve done enough tweaking that updating is a serious painâ€¦ but i know itâ€™s pretty much necessary this early in a new platform!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hello all, i just updated to bios 1003 this morning and i just checked again and notice that 1003 was removed from their website hopefully nothing is wrong with these bios",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"you can with a usb stick, you just export your config and re-import after the update using the profile utility.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it just would never boot on xmp i or xmpii.,"i would set it in the bios with no other tweaks, and the computer would just blackscreen after the asus boot splash screen, then hang there until i manually turned off the computer.","once or twice, it did boot, but it would immediately blue screen before i even got to open a web browser.","that's why i honestly switched to the trident z5 memory, in the hopes that even if i couldn't run it at xmp rated 6000mhz, that i would be able to run it at 5200mhz+.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

first of all congrats on launching alder lake for laptops!,impressive performance gains and honestly can't wait to see what they'll do in more efficient systems without the hungry dgpu.,"i have three questions that i'd like answered,  


1. alder lake desktop has a quirk (or maybe it was intentional?)",where the uncore/ring clock would drop by 1ghz whenever an efficiency core wakes up from a sleep state even when not power/thermal limited.,is that behavior still present on alder lake h?,2. have there been any thread director changes from desktop to the laptops (h-series specifically)?,"3. not that i'm complaining, but is there any reason you guys decided to give the 45w chips the full 96eus configuration of xe graphics.",also will there be any alder-lake-h laptops without the dgpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

with the release of the new alder lake architecture some new specific instructions were also added.,one such instruction (a very interesting one) is hreset which requests the processor to selectively reset selected components of hardware history maintained by the current logical processor.,this instruction may enable better alignment into the current running  threads or for a specific part of the running thread into the hardware internal control heuristics.,"in some cases, the proper use of this instruction can provide both a performance improvement and avoid a security leak between two different threads.","given the importance of this instruction, i would like to know if intel has already made available any case studies of application of this instruction in the context of the mobile platform.","&#x200b;

not a major difference.","sure the chip itself is stronger, do you think that although the ram speed i will see a significant improvement ?",it just feels that the b460 chipset is a complete waste.,"and about win11, what it has to do with it?","all the p/e cores schedule is only effective for alderlake, and besides i hear a lot of complains about the new version of win, as for all upgrades in the past.","i tend to wait at least 6 months, especially when win 10 works just fine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

negative the b460 was the perfect example as the 11th series was not compatible with it.,only the z490 and h470 were compatible.,most likely these were restrictions placed by intel on the board manufacturers.,i'd also not touch any of the modern b660 boards as they made it so it can run overclocked memory like ddr4 3600 but it runs it at gear 2 where z690 runs in gear 1 mode so you lose performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why 120fps?,what titles do you play?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not much.,probably a situation here and there will be cpu limited.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

t skus are specified for lower power operation as those sff systems have limited cooling capacity.,putting a high power sku in there will lead to thermal throttling and likely lower performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
download xtu and see if you can change the power limits with your existing cpu.,"if they haven't locked you out, then in theory you could get any compatible cpu and set the power limits to match your existing one.",that way there would be no thermal problems.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if the board supports t skus the bios will likely support non t variants of the same model as well, but i would check the power rating of the power supply first, make sure it has enough power for the non t cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i put a regular i7 4790 (84w) in an alienware alpha.,the bios limited the power to 35w so it didn't make a difference.,"out of curiosity, i recently threw a 4785t (35w) and the difference was minimal.",the 4785t had a slightly higher cinebench mt score but nothing you'd notice.,tldr if the bios limits the power then it's fine.,if the bios lets it use full power then it'll thermal throttle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"according to [ark.intel.com](https://ark.intel.com), both use the same socket",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in that case, any gains to be had from installing a higher power non-letter cpu would be negated by thermal throttling, right?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm looking through xtu and found this section where it looks like i can change power settings.,[here's what i have available to me.,](https://i.imgur.com/zsaddg8.png) what settings should i be able to change to confirm that i can use a regular 6th gen core cpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the power supply for the computer is 65w, with the adapter saying it outputs 20v at 2.25a.","from what i can find, the 6100t draws 35w of power, and standard variants draw 65w.","does that mean it wouldn't be supported since the 65w for the cpu is already maxing out the power supply, on top of everything else in the computer that needs power?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as other users have said, you could look at tuning your cpu to reduce the power, but yeah you'll be limiting yourself by doing that anyway.",best case scenario you get maybe 100-200mhz.,"realistic case is you'll thermal throttle and your performance will become variable..

these machines are designed for specific skus, they're really don't leave headroom there for higher power skus.","you can still upgrade to a higher end t sku on the table you provided, those shouldn't throttle.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"basing on my experience with underpowering intel chips, you could start with clicking on the drop-down menu on ""turbo boost power max.""","if it did drop-down showing multiple options, it's likely that you can with other chips.","though from how the bars themselves aren't greyed out, you ""should"" be able to.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"20v at 2.25a is like 45w.. i wouldn't risk using it, atleast find a 95w rating adaptor to be safe.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'll look for upgrading with t skus instead of the non-letter variants.,thanks for your help!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ahhhhh another traveler to caldera!,if you are frame chasing in warzone there are a myriad of options available to you!,what resolution do you game at and what gpu do you have?,warzone loves fast cpus as well as fast low latency memory.,i have a 9900k/3080ti and game at 1440p and recently went from 32gb ddr4 3200 cl16 memory to 32gb 3600 cl14 and the performance increase was very noticeable.,my cpu is currently stock but if ya like i can reenable my 5ghz all core oc and report back some fps numbers for ya.,i cap mine at 140 fps due to my gsync panels,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when i had my 9900k i ran it at 4.7 ghz on all cores.,i could push it to 4.9 ghz but this produced too much heat so i left it at 4.7 ghz.,i doubt that the extra 2-300 mhz make that much difference to be honest.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i don't play warzone but on cold war, it is noteiciable with better 1% lows at a resolution of 4k.","i have mine oc'd to 5.1ghz, 4.8ghz uncore, 0 avx offset, llc high, 1.45v.","ymmv, but if you have a good enough cooling setup, than it is definitely worth overclocking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think warzone is one of the most ram latancy dependent games out there.,but it's still not earth chattering gains going from slow to fast ram.,about 10-12 %.,still more than an overclock on the cpu.,"but a cpu oc and new fast ram can give you a great boost for sure, if going from 190 fps to 220ish fps is worth houndreds of dollars for you.",yt channel frame chasers is obsessed by it and have a lot of videos testing stuff out on both intel and amd.,here's a video testing different ram speeds: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuf7iqx\_x1g,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, that last 100 mhz will give you 100+ fps.","i mean use your brain, how much performance would you expect from a 2% increase in frequency?",memory tuning is the way to go for fps.,get to 4000+ c16 with tuned subs and tertiaries and your fps will skyrocket,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have quite similar rig !,"â€¢9900k 4.7 ghz stock so it boosts to 5ghz sometimes on light workload

just like you iâ€™m using an lg ultragear monitor at 144 hz in 1440p so i tend to cap my fps.",the thing is that with this new season of warzone i get some noticeable drops after few games!,it can get as low as 80 fps i donâ€™t know if its a memory leak or something.,yes some numbers would be much appreciated!,thanks a lot for your time :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is the channel that had me going down the ram rabbit hole in the first place!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i actually use warzone to benchmark my temps in my sff build.,warzone is the only game that can push my ram to 60c in my case.,"i am using 3600 at 14,15,15,35.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

don't waste your time.,"i had the same setup, warzone was capped at 144hz for me.",if you're getting frame drops with a 3080 and your cpu usage is not pegged at 100% something wrong with the game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't think i've ever been cpu bound for cold war or any other game per say.,"i just booted up cyberpunk earlier and i'd argue it's the most intense game in the market with everything cranked but at 4k, i can get a reasonable 65+fps with 60% cpu usage.","if you're playing warzone, than i think you're fine, plus you'd be more gpu bound.","on a side note, my cooler is a 280mm aio and i have a similar mobo but it's the gigabyte gaming z390m and i'm also running xmp 2.0 with 3600 cl16 ripjaws v's.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah, it's extremely ram intensive.","never played it myself, just looked it up to see memory benchmarks when i was about to buy a new platform.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because some stuff are so obvious i just wonder why people even ask them.,"anyways, gaming performance is mainly tied to cache speed and memory latency.","overclocking the cpu helps, but not by a lot.","you might get a 5% increase going from 4.7 to 5 ghz, assuming you are not gpu bottlenecked.","on the other hand tuned memory can give you up to 30%, so there is that",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you sir !,!,ðÿ˜„,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s not a waste of time.,there is/was a known bug that if your fps randomly tanked in game youâ€™d boost render resolution to 200% then drop it back to 100% and it corrected itself.,"bugs aside chasing fps for a competitive edge is really fun, my entire squad does it and itâ€™s helped boost fps significantly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thats what i was thinkingâ€¦ shitty optimization this season!,thanks for the feedback,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for sharing with me your experience !,well warzone is more cpu bound since i never get more than 70% gpu usage almostâ€¦ but on cyberpunk itâ€™s always 95%+ gpu usage and with everything crancked up in 1440 p with dlss on quality i can get a solid 90-100 fps.,i guess itâ€™s not worth the time to oc then haha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean i went from sub 120 fps to spiking over 180 between ram and other system optimizations with frame chasers and a few other videosâ€¦being an enthusiast i buy hardware to match my fps and now i need 240hz panels!,ðÿ˜…,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no man itâ€™s not abvious itâ€™s 300 mhz there !,"when it comes to my memory i ocd my crucial ballistix to 3800 mhz cl16 for 1.36 volts (effectively itâ€™s 1,35)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"do one thing at a time, in case you run into issues you know what you changed.",ocing a 9900k to 5ghz is relatively free if you have a good cooler.,"a good starting point is multiplier to 50x, ring to 48x, and cpu voltage to 1.3x volts.",run cinebench passes to make sure your cpu is happy then try the game.,from there you can ram tweak.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

both are equally fast if your just gaming 12600k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm in the same boat and just went with the 12600k.,all the benchmarks i'm seeing show the 12600k performs comparably to the 12700k and even 12900k in most games.,if i were doing more cpu intense work like video editing or rendering then it would be a tougher choice.,but since i'm not going to really need those extra cores i can't really justify spending $100+ for no perceivable performance difference in my use case.,considering my i7-4790 lasted me 8 years i'm thinking this 12600k will last me a similar amount of time.,"hopefully i can update the graphics card in the next year, but i refuse to pay these ridiculous markup prices we're stuck with now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i saw some samples on yt but i aiming 1080p low settings on games to max out cpu so no diff betwen i7 vs i5 ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hi, i'm in a similar boat as you were.",considering getting a new system (currently running 4790k and 1070) keeping the 1070 i have till i can upgrade.,how do you look back on making the change?,any regrets?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your 1070ti is currently the bottleneck if you get either.,"but id recommend the the 12700k, you get 2 more performance cores, higher clock speeds, more cache, allegedly better ram speed/timing support.","in average fps today, they will perform the same in most games, but the 12700k has better 1%/.1% lows, so you experience less stuttering, but both are still at the top of the charts.","but the bigger issue is longevity, 6 core cpus are becoming the norm, and a few games already use 8 cores, with more likely taking advantage of 8 cores in the future.",so what happens in 3+ years?,the 12600k wont age as well as the 12700k.,"so you have to ask yourself how long you plan to keep your cpu, if its like 5+ years, get the 12700k, if its 3 years, get the 12600k.","outside of gaming, the 12700k is obviously better today in multi-threading by a pretty good margin.","neither choice is wrong, just depends on what you're doing and how long you plan to keep the cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no regrets.,"don't know that i've seen any difference in games, but everything else is much snappier.","i can actually max out my gigabit connection when downloading things now, and i hardly notice when plex is transcoding in the background.",now that gpu prices are dropping it hopefully won't be too long before i can grab one near msrp.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd respectfully disagree about the whole 'need moar coarez for future-proofing' argument with regards to gaming.,"imo it is a bit of a gamble for gaming and historically it hasn't panned out, but who knows in the future..?","people have been saying games will use more cores for a while now but it still hasn't happened yet -- yes, there are outliers, but i'm talking about the majority of games.",look at how a ryzen 1800x [performs](https://youtu.be/whfua0f5sm4) vs a 5600x.,the 5600x has fewer cores and threads but does better because the ipc is significantly better.,"considering the 1800x is nearly 5 years old at this point, if you waited 5 years, intel would probably be on their 14th or 15th generation with better ipc than 12th gen -- assuming no major set backs like they had.","all that said, if stretching out to a 12700k isn't going to break someone's budget, and they want to have some level of comfort knowing that they might be ""future proofed"" i'd say by all means, go for it.","but if it's the choice between getting a 12600k and taking the extra money to get a better gpu, then to me, i'd rather invest in a better gpu.","edit:  adding to this,  i think the idea about ""future-proofing"" probably comes from the 2500k vs 2600k.",the people that bought the 2600k had better longevity because they had more threads.,"while that's true, the other thing to consider is that ipc didn't have any substantial increase over time,  in some cases actually regressed because of their security issues, and because intel was unable to get their new architecture out due to it being tied to process node.","had they been able to, we probably would have seen much better ipc increases like we got from 11th->12th gen.  if you look at how the 12th gen.  i3 [holds up](https://youtu.be/nhlha9ant_s) vs other 12th gen cpus, it's actually not bad.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks!,"i do feel like my pc is sometimes having some tough times running multiple programs when doing stuff with photoshop for example, upgrading would fix it.",i'll keep consider.,"thanks for your input, much appreciated!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i somewhat agree with the whole idea of ""future proofing"" is nonsense when you don't actually know what the future holds.","but 1800x was a trash gaming cpu when it came out, time only made it worse, it's bad latency city, bad latency don't get better with time, don't care how many threads and cores it had.",bad example.,but i do also agree with bottom comenter.,look how many regretful 6600k buyers there are.,and it's not like i5 and i7 are ridiculously differently priced.,"in my area i5 is 350, i7 430.",80â‚¬ for two whole extra cores is not terrible value either.,"if your looking for price to performance, non k skus is where is at.","and 80â‚¬ doesn't net you the next tier gpu upgrade these days, sadly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it wasnâ€™t worth it to buy the i7 back thenâ€¦but i sure have talked to a lot of people who regret buying a 6600k or 7600k.,i think itâ€™s really cheap to go with a high end professor like a 12 series and not just go for the i7â€¦just spend a little more and donâ€™t worry about it.,of course iâ€™d also say for gamingâ€¦why the hell upgrade to the new intel platform if you have a gpu from an architecture nearly 6 years oldâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have to disagree with you too, i think that more cores will be extremely useful in the future.",look where a 2 or 4 core processor gets you now... bottlenecked in virtually every video game (with a more modern gpu).,"but given the fact that gpu prices will one day go down, i feel gamers should be at least be considering the i7 for their budget.",the idea that tech continuously climbs up faster than people expect i honestly don't believe is going to slow down in any significant way.,like people who doubted programs would start to regularly run on 64-bit or when people in 2008 were contemplating if they really needed the 32gb hhd over the 16.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think we met the new head of marketing at intel.,where is amd on the chart?,nowhere if we don't put it on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what a pathetic attempt.,"not only are you selecting the worst amd cpus for this chart, you even fail at the fact that the chart shows the opposite of what you think.",up to 60w the two amd cpus score the highest of any cpu on the chart.,"so congrats on showing that two amd apus (one zen2 based no less) , that have lower perf than the normal cpus, are outeprforming within the 60w envelope (they are after all 65w parts) every other cpu on the chart.",i think i lost some brain cells.,"i mean, dude,  both amd cpus score 3.000 points at 20w.",all other intel parts need 40+ w to score 3.000 points .,"nobody is saying alder lake is not good, but - stop trying to show things we already know.","yes, if you stuff 180w down its throat, it performs great.",this chart would look all kinds of stupid for cinebench with a 5950x on it too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5700g with an a520??,lmao.,where is the 5800x and 5900x?,u really just post charts wothout any real meaning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"errr... i don't think you want to be at the ""top"" of this graph.","on the right, maybe.",but not on the top.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"technically amd is there, but not the high performing ones, just the apus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they could've added a non-g high-end processor to the mix, but i wouldn't say they selected the worst amd cpus for the chart, but the wrong ones to prove their point lol.","if they selected something like the 5800x instead of the 5700g, they wouldn't have been able to prove the opposite point of high efficiency under 50 watts, since the apus are much more efficient under lighter loads, due to the monolithic core and lack of high ryzen idle power that increases low-power overhead.","so i think they did choose the right cpus(except adding a non-g would've helped), but it just doesn't prove their point is all lol.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"those numbers a so .... 

the e-cores only ( so 4 e-cores ) are doing 1250 for 25w??","while amd apus are pulling 13w and 20w (4750g / 5700g) , hitting 3000 score.",>  all other intel parts need 40+ w to score 3.000 points .,its 25w actually for the full 11700 ( scoring 3100 ).,"where as the 3000 score, is with p cores only.","that 40w is the 11th gen. 

those charts are so confusing and take a lot of time to figure out what is what cpu actually on the lower power draws.",and what is up with the scaling.,"left is power usage but the 11700 is scaled 150, while indicating 140. but the 12700 is 105 on the same line.",it looks like the op pulled the 12700 graphics upwards on the lower end and dropped them on the higher end or ... head pain!,its not properly scaled for the 12700 its results.,same for the 11700. the amd scales look correct.,its a mess...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[removed],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what?,nah the 12700k i have right now is way more efficient than the zen2/3 cpus in the comparisons i have done vs the 12700k.,ran with multiple wattage limits enforced from 34w to 45 to 60 to 80 to 125 and above an 12gen was better.,desktop cpus used in comparison and no blender/cinebench because it is not what i run and therefore not important for me even though the 5950x would be best here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
correct me if i am wrong.,"i think he is using 5700g because it consumes less power then the 5800x which is a direct 
contender to the 12700.not a fan boy of either company but intel did a pretty good job.","not a s efficient as ryzen but 
they improved a bit over rocket lake.","they should have used a b550 borad but 
again what could we do about that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"b450 supports ryzen 5000

that's more expensive than a ryzen 5600x for not that much better performance.","i mean you could oc the 12400f like crazy, but you'd need a better cpu cooler as well.",i would only advise ryzen users to switch to intel if they're stuck on b350/x370 boards that don't support ryzen 5000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i went from the exact same motherboard and cpu that you have to b660 and 12400f

it cost the same as 5600x alone in my country (once i sold my old parts it was even cheaper, but that is very location dependant).","performance is similar, but it has better pcie lanes (which was very important for me).",i play a lot of cpu intensive stuff where my gpu usage kept dropping down to 50-60% in some heavily populated areas.,if you have a high refresh rate monitor and plan on getting a better gpu anyway i would say either zen3 or alder lake are worth it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
really does depend on your region.,"if the 5600x is cheaper than a new mobo+alder lake, go for it and vice versa.","however, i personally would wait for a while, esp.",due to the rx570.,i assume you will not see any significant uplift and i'd rather wait and see what zen4 and raptor lake will offer.,"perhaps by then, pricing will have calmed down (a faint hope, buy yeah) and you will be able to do a complete upgrade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think waiting for intel 13th gen or zen 4 might make sense.,"alder lake is good, but i have this feeling intel will pull something out of their hat to better compete with ryzen 7000.  some benchmarks for the newest ryzen 6000 mobile-only series [leaked out](https://twitter.com/benchleaks/status/1486303520789872643).",the 7000 series will be above that.,intel will have to respond somehow.,maybe they'll put e-cores on the base i5 model?,"besides that, pricing for ddr5 and gpus might come down by the time the next generation is out.","that rx 570 probably won't benefit from a new cpu (a few games might, but if you're limited to 60 fps, there's not much point).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you won't see an uplift in performance with that gpu and personally i would just go with a 5600x unless you find a crazy deal on a 12400 with b660.,"then again, if you upgrade the gpu, you'll probably want to upgrade the monitor as well so maybe at that point an extra hundred for an extra mobo doesn't matter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if your motherboard is good then try to get 5800x or 5600x.,"sell that ram, buy 2x16gb kit.",12400f+ h610 will cost you = 5600x i think.,you have so many options.,how long do you keep your pc ?,"that ryzen 2600 is capable cpu and will remain so for next 4-5 years, at least for games.",my advice is to settle down with 2x16gb ram config.,save $$ for 4k capable gpu and 4k monitor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as much as i hate the price of the 5600x, i think youâ€™re better off paying more for the 5600x since youâ€™re on a am4 motherboard.",changing the cpu + motherboard will probably end up being more expensive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ultimately itâ€™s your money but there is no reason to upgrade your cpu with your current gpu for gaming right now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if your non-gaming workloads would benefit from a cpu upgrade then i would say go for it.,otherwise considering a gpu upgrade when the price is right would be the gamer move.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"b660+12700 ,my suggestion",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3600 cpu would be improvement also and could probably pick up used with how often people are flipping.,depending on your location and availability.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
id get the intel cpu and mobo.,performance is less yes but once you sell off the old platform the cost becomes less.,its new a platform with upgrade path for at least 1 more generation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

don't tempt me :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you would make more reselling your cpu and mobo as apposed to selling just the cpu.,it will work out cheaper to get the 12400 which is damn close to 5600x perf in a lot of applications.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"no, a comedian.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably not.,he's assuming op wouldn't sell the 2600 to offset the cost of a 5600x.,once the 2600 is sold the total cost definitely normalizes in favor of in-socket upgrading.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have a z690 aorus pro with a 12700kf and no issues here.,i fail to believe that the latch is bending anything.,"thereâ€™s just no way the cpu is under that much force and if it was, how would the substrate not bend too?",and how would there be no indentations where the latch meets the tabs on the ihs?,it just doesnâ€™t make sense.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
im using z690 pro a. and having no issue.,another friend of mine bought the same board and have no issue either.,my theory here after reading a fews thread is that its not because of the board but the lga 1700 backplate.,im using msi 1700 bracket out of the box for their new aio supporting new 12th gen and so does my friend.,"their backplate is really thick, i check some other backplate of who those confirm no issue, and their backplates are very thick too ( artic freezer.",ek.,etc.),and some of those who confirms having bending issue has a very thin backplate.,but im not sure if its just  concidence.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hey, i have the same questions but iâ€™m looking to build a budget pc with a matx board.",i usually buy gigabyte because iâ€™ve had good luck w them on boards not failing.,"iâ€™m waiting on the i3-12300 or i3-12100 to release as you canâ€™t get those chips right now, but they are clearly the right price for integrated graphics.",does anyone have experience with matx and seeing this bending problem?,or w gigabyte?,"i did plan to just go stock cooler, itâ€™s not for me iâ€™m not looking to change the clocks.",but it sounds like you need the right backplate?,i didnâ€™t even realize the backplate can be changed w a 3rd party cooler.,can someone recommend a beefy but budget backplate cooler solution for a budget build?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks, i wanted to make mention of this stuff in the post but it'd get too lengthy.","something i was wondering, can the stock backplate you get with the cooler be replaced with a more solid, 3rd parts backplate?",are those available?,"also, do you see any risks from countering excessive pressure on one side with quite some pressure on the order?","like, could something just snap at some point?",lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are there any with a stronger backplate?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"good to know, thanks.","to check if i understand correctly... the importance of the backplate is due to the additional downward pressure the heatsink can put onto the ihs, to the point that weak backplates would break?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"backplates come with the cooler, correct?",what coolers come with stronger metal backplates?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice.,how long have you been using the cpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as far as i understand it's something that occurs more with some motherboards than others, and it probably doesn't appear immediately but with a bit of time.","if you're not having this issue, that's great.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is plenty of proof of this happening.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the heatsink + ilm is supposed to provide 200lb of load on the cpu ihs, but the ilm only provides 50-66% of that.",this much load would cause a slight deflection in the ihs when applied in the center.,"theoretically the the 20-30 psi loading from the heatsink base plate should also slightly bend the upper and lower portions cpu ihs, making it more flat.","imo when in doubt, add more heatsink pressure.",plenty of posts on this subject about how the washer mod didn't do anything or caused boot failures but then temperatures got better after they re-assembled it back to the stock configuration.,that indicates the initial application didn't tighten down the heatsink enough the first time around.,that they're failing to boot after loosening the ilm also means they're being too cowardly with the heatsink mounting.,the ihs is bigger than the previous cpus and most thermal paste needs 20-30 psi of interface pressure for optimum bond line.,that's upwards of 75 pounds of force required from the heatsink!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hey u and i got the same setup lol.,i assume the msi s360 aio?,that backplate was still plastic tho.,"with that said as mentioned on my other reply to someone, its running fine.","70-72c on r23 on silentish fan profiles   
mines the dd4 version of the pro",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same board.,make sure you get that msi bios update that just came out for memory compatibility.,i'm finally able to stably run my memory w/ xmp for how it was made at 3600mhz w/ 14 cas at gear 1 and it's a noticeable improvement.,before that it felt like i wasted my money on expensive memory since i could barely get it to 3200mhz with crappy timings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i dont think something like that is available on market.,i know some backplates works on different coolera which use same mounting mechanism but its not official.,i think it would be more about custom made backplates or some dyi solutions for this.,also if you try to counter some preasure you would probably ends with uneven preasure which could cause worse cooling performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've been using a 12900k since launch and there's no issue.,anyone that has an issue with a standard heatsink that isn't lapped and thinks they have an issue with temperatures should tighten it down more.,they need 75 pounds of loading force from the heatsink to reach 20+ psi loading that the good enthusiast thermal paste needs.,this level of pressure should also flatten the ihs to a degree.,">but i'm kinda more worried about possible long term effects, e.g.",what if pins to cpu contact weakens at the edges?,you have a misconception here.,the ilm applies so much force because the design needs to ensure contact with all pads for the duration of the life of the system as the the ilm loosens from thermal cycling.,this is why some people loosening their ilm have boot failures after they've been too cowardly with the heatsink mounting pressure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
â€œplentyâ€?,igorâ€™s lab and buildzoid who say most wonâ€™t ever have this problem?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this has been blown waaay over, and this is why jay2cents would jump on this for the clicks and spread even more crap.","i am in mid 70's on r23 on a 12900kf, same board z690 aorous pro ddr4, since launch.",igor i believe released a new article confirming this...honestly is something people don't need to do.,"i'd say, to anyone that after 2-3 months if your noticing odd behavior, take it apart and do the mod if you need, otherwise just enjoy the cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thereâ€™s much more to it than this.,iâ€™d encourage you to watch the video buildzoid did on the mod.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mine is p240.,and actually the bracket of mine is different from your s360.,"some how yours premium highend aio has a worse bracket  than mine, maybe they went for the look.","mine is a very thick steel backplate  
edit, you're right.",mine is also a plastic.,but it  might be hard enough i guess,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"interesting, so you're saying this could be an issue of low heatsink pressure/weak tightening?",anyway what i meant with that sentence is: if the cpu bends inward (due to the downward pressure being predominantly centralized by bracket design) i'm wondering if the edges of the cpu could elevate and/or end up having a too weak contact with the motherboard pins.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,"they said the bending shouldn't cause too much thermal issues as the coolers are usually convex, and they should still have good contact with the now concave ihs, caused by the focused pressure applied by the ihs.",you said bending doesn't exist.,"i said it exists, neither buildzoid nor igorslab say otherwise.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">igor i believe released a new article confirming this

confirming this?",":

`the majority of user reports in our forum, but also in other forums, describe improvements in core temperatures of 4-10 â°c.â `",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"aye, it felt a bit cheap when i put th eback plate..i was like...is it mean to wobble soo much lol, but naturally once u pop everything in its solid",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>i'm wondering if the edges of the cpu could elevate and/or end up having a too weak contact with the motherboard pins.,no it can't because you should have a heatsink pushing down on the entire package.,unless you plan on running the cpu without a heatsink it's not a problem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m not disputing the fact that the ihs may be curved iâ€™m disputing the that the latch mechanism is whatâ€™s causing it.,if you watched buildzoids video all the way through you will have heard him say that intel heat spreaders have been curved for years.,maybe on some of the earlier made 12th gen cpus the ihs were faulty in a sense?,idk but thereâ€™s no way that latch is exerting that much force to warp the heat spreader without totally warping the substrate or separating the ihs a little from it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
people who reported having the bent cpu issue were (obviously) using an heatsink.,"whether the screw tightening pressure of said heatsinks is a decisive factor, that's up for discussion i guess",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your elaboration seems more reasonable.,"it's posible that your point of view is true, that the ihs come faulty from factory, but then the ""washer mod"" negates it a bit, since it's proven to aliveate the pressure aplied to the middle of the ihs and the concaveness (is this such a word?)",becomes less pronounced.,mine is bent.,did it come like that?,i'm not sure.,it's a matter of actually testing new cpus for flatness.,most of us who see bending probably didn't check when new.,"and i'll add that my bent ihs doesn't seem to affect, or not in obvious ways, my temperatures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

well... in the current gpu market its not a bad idea to get intel gpu when ever they release it especially if they are cheaper then amd/nvidia gpu which has similar performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

lol they could release an absolute turd and it would still sell like hotcakes.,look at the 6500xt release from amd.,a dung heap gpu which is worse than gpus from 5 years ago and still sold out on all stores.,intel doesnâ€™t need to make a good gpu.,they just need to ensure it exists in the market supply.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the 12600k is the sweet spot right now and if you like to buy for the future proofing then you can't go wrong with the 12600k.,if you are wanting to save some money then the 12400 is a good option.,the 12400 has the same amount of p-cores but no e-cores.,but i wouldn't say its over spend for your needs at all and will probably last you many years.,10 cores for that kind of money is a steal imo.,"not every cpu can handle 4000mhz ram, my 12700k cant for example.",but that's not to say your cpu wouldn't.,i would personally go for 3600mhz if possible as that does seem a stable sweet spot that is almost a guarantee to work.,as anything over 3200mhz is considered overclocking as per the intel spec.,"i'm not familiar with the gigabyte boards unfortunately, but my msi board is spot on.",i honestly don't think you can go wrong with any z690 board as they are well built and have good vrms.,i'd just check out some reviews beforehand to make sure it suits your needs.,if you planned to get a 12400 or a 12600 non k with no overclocking then i'd get a h670/b660 board instead as the z690 would be pointless.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
take everything you are thinking about and stop ðÿ›‘.,you donâ€™t need any of this right now.,relax and give the diy pc market another year to stabilize in terms of prices.,"ddr5 is ridiculously expensive and if you are contemplating using ddr4 just to complete a new build now, you are ultimately wasting money.","plus, there are not even coolers on the market now with lga1700 support (without the use of an adapter).","at the very least, i would wait until cooler manufacturers have caught up before considering throwing your money out of the window",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
regardless of ddr5 pricing itâ€™s always logical to skip the first generation of new ddr as it tends to be at best on par with the previous gen. so if anything it makes more sense to pick up a cheaper kit of ddr4 right now and have 2-3% difference in performance.,by the time ddr5 gets significantly better a few cpu gens will have passed and buying a new mobo will be way cheaper.,thereâ€™s also many coolers that come with lga 1700 support now (i recently bought one) and the brackets for older coolers are not difficult to get.,if youâ€™re claiming not to get new hardware because of a cooler then you were never going to buy the hardware in the first place.,"also a tip is not to tell people how to spend their money, people value things differently.",youâ€™ve just given the op a non answer based on your own issues and itâ€™s like you donâ€™t want the op to be happy.,"youâ€™re in no position to tell anyone what they donâ€™t need, especially on a random post on the internet.",i bought a 12700k and the aforementioned cooler and i couldnâ€™t be happier.,the op was asking for advice on their component choices.,not for you to shit on their aspersions.,"if you donâ€™t value new tech then itâ€™s fine, but there is a time and a place and this isnâ€™t it.","the op didnâ€™t ask if they should upgrade, just if what they were choosing was overkill and correct for their needs.",upgrading a 12 year old pc is going to be good value.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if you feel some smug pleasure in thinking your intel cpu makes your rig better those same people likely see their rig as better irregardless of benchmarks because intel is nothing short of the scummiest company in tech next to nvidia and they know they are supporting competition so we donâ€™t end up in a time like 2011-2016 where amd nearly went under and intel stagnated and rested on their laurels shoving the same dang product out with a new series number year after year and 4 cores in most cases predominately offered like itâ€™s still 2007.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
everything,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
too much... i think like 4.5-5k aud,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

time to spend way to long on making a custom rgb scheme,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do it.,the side rgb looks amazing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i reset cmos, booted straight to windows and ran intel xtu and it bsoded with clock_watchdog_timeout.",i had that happen twice in a row.,so i got a new cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is extremely rare.... honestly find it hard to believe that is what happened here.,more likely cause is bent pins or installation damage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i originally only had the ql fans at the front and rear then like a week ago i found a set of 4 new in box (3 pack and a 1 pack) for $100 aud.,and the ql120 3 packs come with a corsair lighting node core in the box.,so in total i spent like ~$270 aud for my fan setup,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

interesting  i had the same thing happen.,what did you do to return?,it didn't do that with the new one?,for me stock is fine.,it doesnt like the xtu auto overclocking tho.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
clock watchdog usually happens when the core clock is too high.,"your cpu wasnâ€™t faulty, you had some overclocking weirdness happening.",did you have an ai oc thing running in the bios?,an example is that when asus ai oc is first learning to overclock your processor it throws tons and tons of voltage at it; you get watchdog timeout errors a lot.,it then tapers off,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they are corsair ql120 fans.,"which require controllers (commander core or commander pro, both expensive)as well as the fans themselves.",currently the most expensive rgb fans you can buy to my knowledge.,"was looking at them myself, but ended up going with the lian li sl120 fans for much cheaper and much better performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yea it is nuts out there.,"i'm in the process of building my first pc, buying piece by piece, just ordered my mobo.",goin to go with ddr5 i'm hoping by the time i get around to ordering my ram ddr5 will be more prevelant.,i chose to go with intel gonna get 12th gen i7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sweet goodness.,yeh 12th gen s kinda got me lusting after an upgrad but yeh..with 10th gen it would be totally dumb to upgrade.,"but yea, i think ur gna have a great time with the 12700, beast of a cpu.",well best of luck with ur search for a gpu n that sweet high freq ddr5 goodness,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks i'm gonna need it lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's funny because the best ddr5 ram on the market for overclocking is literally dell server ram,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hm didnt know that... well im hoping thats at least something that dell s doin right?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wait for alder lake mobile?,"12th gen. big improvement in performance over 11th gen.

the 12800h defi itely will be worth it if you're willing to wait a few months,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but you don't specify the programs.,what if they use gpu acceleration and you need a gpu more than the cpu ?,what if you want to do some gaming as well and you need a gpu?,or you dont and someone recommends something with a gpu and you are wasting money?,ofc its better in a vacuum but no one will give you a recommendation.,how can we if we don't know whats it for.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i need the laptop asap,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12900hk i think,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they're very specific programs for designing some embroidery processes, you probably wouldn't know them, but i am 100% sure that i am missing cpu performance because i've tested it on a desktop with ryzen 5900x and it ran smoothly and didn't use almost any gpu performance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"then yes, 11800h is a good choice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in reality, unless all your programs work on both macos and windows, which isn't the case for many, it really doesn't matter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it is, because most people won't be sitting rendering things without a power outlet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there was a post here regarding the latest i9-12900hk moving over the m1 max, but because this sub is such an echo-chamber, i was shocked at how people just jumped with the hypetrain without digging a bit deeper.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i wouldâ€™ve understood this mindset, until the m1 max destroyed that perception.",when it gives you the same performance whenâ€¦being mobile.,the max doesnâ€™t sweat even when unplugged.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the problem here is comparing x86 to arm, the transition is not as simple at it seems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unfortunately for you power draw from the 12900hk has been measured in quite a few articles now.,and so has the m1 max.,"the 12900hk does not in fact win in power efficiency, or even come close.","intel has closed the gap between itself and apple/amd from a massive chasm, to a large rift.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"again, thats the power usage of the entire laptop not just the cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
stop fucking comparing m1 to any x86 cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you really just compare power efficiency on the basis of tdp?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
competition is great for customers.,"intel, nvidia and amd are really pushing each other to be better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
both are different architecure and do different things.,you don't have ai cores and other things inside 12900hk and it's not arm based so can't compare apples to pears.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep there is a 30% difference in power usage but it is impressive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wdym?,30 watt base power usage is the information provided by apple for m1 max cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why wouldn't i compare two disparate things used for the same purpose?,"ex: car vs horse, apple vs orange, tomato fruit vs tomato vegtable?","stop fucking using a horse to perform work, we have combustion engines now that don't need to be fed nearly as often, and and travel far longer than a horse.",just because intel wrapped their horse in aluminum and called it a car doesn't mean you need to live in the delusion that it's not relatively busted compared to a modern solution.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well peak power usage for m1 max is from 90-110 watts.,this new intel processor is a laptop processor.,"it offers 4 more cpu cores, more performance than m1 max even on 10nm cpu.",it has potential to beat m1 max in power consumption if they use 5nm architecture and reduce cpu cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"anandtech article :

in single-threaded workloads .... m1 max only uses 8.7w, while a comparable figure on the 11980hk is 43.5w

in multi-threaded scenarios, the package and wall power vary from 34-43w on package, and wall active power from 40 to 62w.","on the gpu side, we lack notable workloads, but gfxbench aztec high offscreen ends up with a 56.8w package figure and 69.80w wall active figure.",the gpu block itself is reported to be running at 43w.,"finally, stressing out both cpu and gpu at the same time, the soc goes up to 92w package power and 120w wall active power",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel is just not gonna win on efficiency here.,they're a full generation behind apple's chips (on tsmc).,both sides have strong designers and ample silicon budget.,this is just a hard physical limit to overcome.,"while the m1 max and 12900hk may peak at similar wattage, the intel chip is allocating almost all the power to a cpu while the m1 max is mostly gpu.","so it's certainly possible for the intel one to outperform in cpu tasks, but it won't be anywhere near as efficient in performance per watt.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"u really need to read up more on how power usage, efficiency and stuff works",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel will be lucky to reach even amd on efficiency this time round, i still think 6000 mobile series will remain the most efficient x86 cpu.",apple m1 is simply in another league .,"as anandtech said, single core m1 is 8.7 w .","when intel is still in the 30 and 40w range to get the same perf, no, not even close.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so you are neglecting the official tdp provided by apple and believing in some random article?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"12th gen on intel 7 is as efficient as zen 3 on tsmc n7, assuming you don't make the judgement solely based on the i9's.","amd will pull ahead in efficiency with zen 4 on tsmc n5, but that will be short lived as meteor lake launches in q1/q2 with chiplets on intel 4.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"post a link on apple.com with the tdp ( you can't because they don't have tdp )

yes, why read anandtech, the oldest and most respected of all tech sites when you can post a screenshot of what looks like userbenchmark, a site that is banned even on r/intel for making intel cpus look good at any cost.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

temps are fine my friend.,"i have a noctua nh d15 and my idle temps are around 30c, gaming 45-60c depending on game, and under benchmark stress tests i see low 80's.",your temps and the random spike to 80c is perfectly normal.,if you feel something is off just reapply thermal paste and reseat your cooler to see if you have any improvements.,enjoy!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
every cpu will have fluctuations like this.,i won't write a super detailed post but i'll keep it sweet and to the point.,it really depends on what the stress tests are hammering what core at that time.,voltages will also be a play in this.,"if it is hammering a core, it will fluctuate different voltages.",it really depends on your llc at this point.,youre going to pull more voltage if your llc increases casuing spikes.,"there is actually quite a bit more, but this is the jist.",if you have it set to auto it's going to go and do the best voltage and llc for that time.,spikes will occur due to this.,"it's normal, and it is fine.",enjoy your cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thank you, i'm just mostly curious about those huge spikes that happen all the time.",this is my first ever processor with such spiky temperature fluctuations.,"normally the fluctuations were within 5-10c with my previous processors, but now temperature can spike 20-40c in no time at all, then come back down to the average right away.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"everyone with the nhd15 reports way lower benchmark temps than me.. thinking i need to repaste and check for bending...

edit: realise this is on a 10900 and mine a 12900 but my point still stands.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah it happens.,idk why it happens.,but it happens with my 7700k as well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
check the cpu usage graph and see if it aligns with the spikes.,my assumption is that you have more headroom so games can call more cpu power when needed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, it seems to correspond with usageâ€”the cpu boosts to 5.3ghz regularly, since itâ€™s not temperature or power-throttled much.","i havenâ€™t done much with downvolting for my latest build, got lazy.",used to play with it a lot with previous builds.,"i tried it briefly (changed llc to give less compensation, and the cpu stopped boosting to 5.3ghz, so i reverted back to auto and left it at that.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"this person here did a breakdown of why getting an affordable motherboard that can oc the i3 is the biggest problem if someone is looking to oc the i3: https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/scmjsx/intel_core_i312100f_review_52_ghz_oc_with_an/hu9rmhp/

what they posted:

> the 12700kf is $395 from newegg, in stock.","the 12700f is $330 from newegg, out of stock.",from intel the official price difference is $70.,"> so not $90, $70 officially and probably less when they discount the k chips.",> there is no $200 board available that can do this.,"the cheapest seems to be the rog strix b660-g gaming wifi, which i can't find a us price for, but here in indonesia is priced $8.40 above the b660-a gaming wifi d4, which is $240 in the us.",so i'd say the board price is $250.,> then you have the issue that it's ddr5.,there is no ddr4 board.,> 16gb of ddr4-3200 c16 is like $60.,"ddr5 around $175

> *if* you are already on ddr5 then you might as well cheap out on the 12700f, but the overclocking of the 12700 is kinda weak already, because it's already at 4.9 ghz, and won't overclock beyond 5.1-5.2 ghz.","> so the overclocking makes sense really only if:

> * you buy a 12100f ($100, 4.3 ghz) or a 12400f ($170, 4.4 ghz)
 
> * there exists an affordable *ddr4* board which can do this

> how affordable?",well the entry level b660m board is like $130.,"> the *overclocked* 12100f loses on overall cpu performance to the regular 12400f, while it wins by like 1-2% when overclocked, for gaming but paying $200 for a (hypothetical) b660m board to overclock a 12100f to the point where it matches a 12400f would be dumb, clearly.",> obviously no useful or relevant motherboards exist.,"so maybe asrock sells one for $150 in the future in which case, great deal.","but anyway, they don't exist now.","> and if/when they do exist, then it's probable that there will be little benefit in ocing the 12100f, in that if you're paying to oc it, you might as well get the 12400f while you're at it, which is also clocked slow, and the $70 extra is worth it for the extra cores and cache.","or when ddr5 becomes as cheap as ddr4, or cheaper.",reminds me of the i3-7350k/8350k/9350k (required a z-series board for ocing) and the quad-core skylake-x cpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's blowing my mind how an 89w peak 4c/8t cpu is clearly outperforming a 12c/24t cpu from 2019 in gaming benchmarks, even at stock clocks with slower ddr4.","the results are similar to what i've seen elsewhere, but it's kind of hard to believe a $97 cpu can be that good.",it at least contradicts every claim about 'future proofing' i've ever heard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how was your 11800h operating at 120c when it thermal throttles at 100c ?,"so the software said laptop was overheating, you opened it up and replaced thermal paste, now the software sais its not overheating.",and you want it to say it is again?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if i remember correctly tjmax of 11th gen mobile should be at 100 degree c, are you sure you are reading stuff correctly?",120c seems rather unlikely to be achievable without introducing system instability.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i will confirm the 1mm washers mod being successful.,"brand new 12700k, certain cores were a good 15â°c above others under full load despite careful paste application and being under a kraken x72.","added the washers under ilm and not only are the temps consistent across cores, they're also 5-10â°c cooler overall.",pretty poor coming from a product that should have been well tested.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

op - check how much power the cpu is drawing using hwinfo.,"my i9 was running at max temp with a 360mm aio, until i realized that my bios had the power limit unlocked, so my cpu was pulling 290+ watts under full load.","i lowered it back to the limit set in intel's spec (241 watts), and my temps went down to 70 degrees max.","the bending is definitely an issue with alder lake board/cooler combos, so its definitely possible that your high temps are caused by that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not saying itâ€™s impossible but i refuse to see how the way the cpu latches on the edges of the 12 series cpus can be enough to bend it without warping the substrate and causing contact issues between the cpu and pins.,i just donâ€™t see it.,plus if itâ€™s enough pressure to bend the ihs then youâ€™d have indentation marks where the latches were.,"iâ€™m betting intel being intel and with their last ihs design never being entirely flat, that some cpus come warped right from the factory.",i have a 12700kf with a noctua u12a and i watch my core temps with hwinfo and all cores are within 2c of each other depending on usage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thanks for the suggestions.,"when you were retightening the ilm, did you tighten it just hand-tight?",8c is a good range for temperature drop.,i will try this as well.,"regarding the max wattage noctua can handle, it seems i should have studied my lesson better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my arctic liquid freezer ii 420 reaches almost 80c at prolonged 210w load.,my guess is that the nh-d15s just doesn't have enough thermal capacity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for sharing the numbers.,adjusting the voltages seems to be the quickest solution i should be working on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for sharing your experience.,i am glad to hear somebody was able to resolve the issue i am experiencing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
glad it worked for you.,i have also done the washer method and the result was a lot more than i was expecting.,i will update this post in a few days with the steps i have followed to bring the temps down.,which cooler and backplate are you using?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are there any instructions for doing the mod and where did you get the back plate?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its not even a problem though.,"the two sources op quotes buildzoid and igorslab, who are the leading people on this subject, have literally said its not an issue for most people and their coolers.",i dont understand how people continue to cite them without actually reading/listening to everything they say.,"the curvature is actually beneficial for most coolers on the market, like asetek based aios (90% of the market).","it only is a hindrance for coolers with completely flat cold plates, which are actually very rare.","the whole reason buildzoid originally found this and tried this, was because his normal aio was doing okay, but his custom lapped (flat) aio was somehow performing worse.","he created a solution for his own issue, most coolers wont have any issue with the bend.","the main reason op is having thermal issues is because hes trying to cool a 12900k at stock under 100% all-core loads with an aircooler... not a single reviewer recommend that, and bend or no bend its not going to cool the 12900k under that situation.","the nh-d15s is perfectly fine for gaming, but not cinebench/blender/compile at stock settings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you experience the same issue with yours?,"unfortunately, the consumer laws in my country do not really work for the consumers, so i am stuck with it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unfortunately i am stuck with both as the consumer laws in my country don't really work in favor of the consumers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which cpu did you experience this issue with?,i was just in between waiting for the next gen amd or jumping on the 12th gen intel wagon up until 2 weeks ago.,now i am questioning whether i made right choice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">i can barely cool my 12700k with air cooling

you must have a really shitty sample or a poor cooler, because this is just not true with my 12700k.",i'm using a noctua nh-u12a and running mild oc and ran these cb23 [results](https://i.imgur.com/tducyrf.jpg) with temps in the upper 70 - lower 80c range drawing ~220w.,"i'm running the two preferred cores at 5.2ghz, the rest of the p-cores at 5.0ghz and e-cores at 4.0ghz with a 4.2ghz ring clock.",running intel's xtu benchmark i peaked at 90c which was 1-2c lower than other public results around my score (i recall drawing around 267w max in that test).,the only time i thermal throttled at 100c was running kombuster cpu burner and that's because it was drawing a pretty crazy 307w.,"p-cores started throttling within 5 seconds at that load, but it's not a load i'd ever run realistically.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
absolutely not true.,my u12a handles a 12900k like a champ.,"75-77c on stock running cbr23, and right now im running a 5.3 / 5.2 ghz all core oc and 5.6 single thread",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks for the video, i had not seen it before.","what made me buy the noctua was the tests comparing this specific model to aio 360 coolers and almost all of them concluded that nh-d15s was at least as good, if not better than aios.","nevertheless, it seems i need something better than that.",maybe i should be looking at creating a custom loop with a radiator bigger than 360.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
does that count aios?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my 12700kf sits under a noctua u12a and never had broken 70c in gaming and i use mce for my easy 5ghz oc.,even on battlefield 2042 which would make my 9900k hot even with the same cooler doesnâ€™t phase my 12700kf.,you have a bad cooler or paste or both.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, you are right about being an early adapter.",i actually disabled asus multicore enhancement in bios and had the cpu work under the limits specified by intel to see what will happen.,it helped just a bit.,"but i have not tried undervolting yet, i should give it a try.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
donâ€™t let it deter you.,the issue is way overblown.,if youâ€™ve seen the 1700 latch and where it contacts the cpu there is no way itâ€™s bending the middle of the ihs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not everyone seems to be affected by the bending issue, i am not sure at this point which direction i can point my finger at since the comments about the causes seem to vary a lot.",i have seen posts of people inspecting how the flat their cpus are and they don't have that problem.,"but if it is going to help, i have seen one other person on another forum having the same motherboard and experiencing the same bending issue; asus z690 hero.",but it can be complete coincidence as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have never used a thermal pad, but i remember reading comments saying it is ok for daily use but not for heavy cpu loads.",i am not sure since i don't have any experience with it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks for the suggestion, i will do that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this issue is something new for me and i did not know intel designs had this problem even before 12th gen, so i did not check how flat the cpu was before i installed it.",i wish i knew it beforehand.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you had actually read what i had written and taken a look at the links i have provided, you would have seen it is not related to user error.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i have a 12900ks and have tried 3 aios, one of which is the 420mm arctic liquid freezer ii among the msi coreliquid 360s.",my temps still immediately hit 100c on stress tests.,it's still an issue for a lot of us (and that's with all the bios turbos/extra voltage settings off).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh that is pretty shitty then.,you can lap the cpu heatsink either while it is seated in motherboard (to fully take into account the bending from the socket) or when it is out.,"before that, i would try the solution that yourself presented: ""*as a solution to this problem, the sources above suggest adding 1mm thick washers under the socket securing mechanism to increase its height, therefore decreasing the pressure from the latch.","*"" 

if you look for a guide on cpu heatspreader lapping then you can look at this one from luumi (who is one of the best overclockers in the world - and from finland like me, so that makes him even better of course).","[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgpoom652fa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgpoom652fa) luumi is quite negative on the effects of lapping the cpu, but yours is so concave on that picture of yours so the effects might be different for you.","i 100% agree that you should not have to deal with this kind of crap, especially on a premium platform like that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe it could be a certain batch of sockets which either came already a little bent out of the factory or they apply too much pressure on the cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

youll throw your money for no reason.,"the problem isnt the d15, the problem is transferring heat to the cooler.",it may be a bending issue or it might just be the soldering.,some cpus have better contant between the ihs and the die than others.,you may unfortunately have one of the bad ones.,"im really happy with mine though, at stock temps are a complete non issue.",u12a is just bonkers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think like others said 12700 isn't readily available everywhere yet .. but i think it's only $30-$40 cheaper than the k so most people opt for the k incase they do want to overclock in the future.,however once you factor in that the 12700 comes with a (good enough if not overclocking i think) cooler and for the k you have to buy a separate cooler the price difference is much greater.,12700k+690z seems a good combo for overclockers  and 12700+b660 seems like the value,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that 100mhz on the p cores and 200 mhz on the e cores don't really matter.....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it doesn't work because it's in gear 1 where the memory controller is working harder (i assume it's similar to the cpu core clock where you need extra volts to push the clock speeds).,"it will work in gear 2 (controller speed goes 50% slower to reduce stress), but it is known that ddr4 gear 2 needs something in the 4500-5000mhz region to keep up with average gear 1 3600. 

ddr5 runs gear 2 by default because the memory controller design in 11/12th gens have never been able to pair ram faster than around 4200mhz in gear 1.

assuming everything stays the same in gear 2, ddr5 should work until something like 7000mhz, then the ratio between controller and ram sticks go smaller (not sure if it's gear 3 i.e.",9600mhz ram has same controller speed as 3200mhz gear 1 or gear 4 where 12800mhz ram works with a controller speed equal to 3200mhz gear 1),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"alright, that's good to know",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
less cores?,12700k and the 12700 have the same amount of cores so does the 12900 and 12900k.,"the only non-k sku that doesn't have the same amount of cores as its k sku is the 12600.

the clock speed you're referencing is the base frequency which hardly matters, if not completely irrelevant.",the boost frequency is what really matters.,12700k has a boost of 5ghz and the 12700 has a boost of 4.9ghz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the m1 max fully loaded across the cpuâ€¦ and gpuâ€¦ hits like 80 watts total.,"i have one, iâ€™ve tested it.",this ainâ€™t the win you think it is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">	m1 max turboes till 110 watts

this is hilariously incorrect.",the m1 chips donâ€™t have turbo frequencies at all.,single core max is 3.2 ghz and all core is 3.0hgz.,fully loaded the cpus will consume about 40 ws.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bro what are you doing.,"everyone is saying that the 92 watts power consumption of the m1 max is of cpu, gpu, ram and all combined.",the power consumption that you are speaking of for the 12900hk is just for the cpu.,"now for the power users who can be plugged in all the time, 12900hk might be a great option but if you are talking about efficiency, then m1 max is way ahead in terms of efficiency.","even the ltt video you are referencing, in that video i think they stated that m1 max is an efficiency beast(i am not confirm in which video did i hear this, it was of ltt or dave2d i don't remember, please spare me on this one).",if there is any mistake please forgive me as i don't write such long comments.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

well you didn't mistake.,intel cpu does use 30% more power than m1 max but it's a close competition.,m1 max is more power efficient but 12900hk offers 4 more cores and more performance than m1 max even on 10nm 64 bit architecture.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok lets assume m1 max uses 90 watts in peak benchmarks.,i9-12900hk uses 115 watts only when overclocked.,so compare base wattage.,30 watts for m1 max and 45 watts for 12900hk.,the 12900hk provides 4 more cpu cores and has more performance than m1 max.,"of course it uses 30% more power but provided the benefits and the fact that it is a 10nm processor, it is impressive these are the benchmarks.",[https://nanoreview.net/en/cpu-compare/intel-core-i9-12900hk-vs-apple-m1-max](https://nanoreview.net/en/cpu-compare/intel-core-i9-12900hk-vs-apple-m1-max),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i am okay whether it is 90 or 110. my point is that  statement that intel pulls up to 115 while mac pulls only 35w is obviously false.",they both can go pretty wild with that but you probably will hardly ever see such consumption in normal world.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
macs really are a good option.,they are power efficient.,they are probably the best machines to do productivity work because of the optimizations.,gaming is another story though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well i didn't mean it when i said it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i do accept the fact that it uses 30% more power.,but it provides 4 more cpu cores and more performance even on 64 bit architecture and 10nm.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you did when i gave you the actual power usage numbers from anandtech.,"single thread the m1 using 10w and intel 60w etc etc

you referred to anandtech as a random site while using a screenshot from a cookie cutter userbenchmark site as ""apple specs"".",you keep using tdp because it is a random low number that has nothing to do with power usage.,alder lake runs pl2 as long as the cooling allows it.,even if it runs pl1 ( 60w ) it still uses twice the power of m1 max in mt apps.,you either don't know better or you have an invested interest in making the 12900hk look better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
m1 max caps it's performance in programs like final cut pro for thermails i.e.,it is not utilised fully.,it is revealed in benchmarks that m1 uses 110 watts for peak performance.,also the turbo wattage of 12900hk is 115watts i.e.,it is only used in that way when overclocked.,power consumption is close to m1 max in normal conditions.,the only thing is apple didn't reveal it's turbo wattage and it is not possible to do so in normal use.,it just caps performance it doesn't mean it is power efficient in this case.,so compare base frequencies: 12900hk is rated for 45 watts while m1 max is rated for 30 watts.,the extra 15 watts usage is justifiable since it has 4 more cores and also performs 5-8% better than m1 max,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"excuse u/kingwavy000, he thought that apple's marketing charts were ""independent testing""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why would that be any better than intel's charts?,the manufacturer of the chips are both going to show charts that work in their favor.,quit being a fanboy of any products.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well yes but they are full apu/socs and m1 is using lpddr4x while m1 pro/max are using lpddr5x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
m1 uarch is using lpddr4 though and since it's a soc package the overall soc has changed other than just adding cores,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

12900hk is different from 12900k.,it is a laptop processor and only uses 115 watts when overclocked.,i'm talking about the processor that released yesterday.,other benchmark reveals that m1 max uses 120watts on ac.,i.e it atleast uses 90 watts in this case.,in final cut pro alone it uses 60 watts.,you are the one assuming wrong.,you are comparing the tdp of m1 max to overclocked wattage of 12900hk.,either compare base wattage or peak wattage.,base wattage comparison is 30watts for m1 and 45 watts for hk.,peak wattage comparison is 115watts for hk and atleast 90 watts for m1 (idle usage is 15-20 watts including the whole pc so the cpu alone atleast uses 90 watts in peak).,"and 12900hk provides 4 more cores, more performanceon a 64 bit 10nm processor",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ok, what your point over original argument with 35w i was reacting to?",i think it does not matter whether it is 110 or 90 in this thread.,thank you for claryfiing that its 90w but it still is alot more than 35w.,"i am not here hunting numbers and i already state mac is still better, i am here to correct that argument more people here stated incorrectly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well you are not considering the tdp 45w of 12900hk you are just comparing the 30 watt to 115 watts which is only used when overclocked.,"so comparing as you said, it is 30vs45 which is reasonable provided intel cpu provides 4 more cores and more performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the whole comment stack started over calling m1 pro/max a ""new generation"" , not strictly a ""new architecture"" ...

i also agreed it's not a ""new architecture"" in the technical sense, yet it's a new generation the same way intel had skylake for years upon years.","this argument went too long imo ...  :) ... the new intel chips seem good  , but not groundbreaking on the laptop side... they're great on desktop , but i'm really worried on the lower power range... intel alderlake looks like it's gonna be starved so hard , amd will be close if not beat it at <45w

edit: <45 w apple m1 max is still king though... helped massively by tsmc 5nm",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean intel works with them directly so they probably knew well ahead of time.,"they weren't dropped because of arm, they were dropped because 10nm was so heavily delayed.","looking at the performance they're delivering, if intel was actually on schedule or even only 2 years late then apple would've had no reason to eat the cost of migrating to arm and expanding tsmc to meet desktop/laptop demands.",they were stuck refreshing skylake and giving people little reason to buy new macbooks so apple moved on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i didnâ€™t because it is irrelevant to the chart in question.,even intel wouldnâ€™t make the mistake of comparing them.,the 96eu igpu in the 12900hk would get slaughtered silly by the m1 max.,the chart is comparing one specific bench mark specintrate 2017. it didnâ€™t even mention specfp rate because intel knows the m1 max with its massive memory bandwidth would embarrass the 12900hk.,the m1 max competes with the 12900k desktop sku in that benchmark.,spec does nothing with the gpu what so ever.,it is a purely cpu benchmark.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
m1 doesnt have a tdp.,"in single-threaded workloads, such as cinebench r23 and spec 502.gcc_r, we see the chip report 11w package power.","in multi-threaded scenarios, the package and wall power vary from 34-43w on package.",thats what it uses.,adl uses pl2 ( 115w ) as long as the cooling is up to it.,cpu to cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why do one care about battery life for a dtr.,its well designed operated well in extreme conditions and has comfortable lead in most benchmarks.,there are other versions of chips that is focused on efficiency and we have seen from 12400/12600 desktop cpus that at lower wattage as well it does quite well.,meteor lake will take it to next level until then this is putting intel in a great shape on client end.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i can only see the ge76 benchmarks.,is the 12th gen laptop cpu (alderlake-p) embargo only lifted for that specific model?,"because cannot find any other laptop with 12th gen h review, and many other youtubers already did release their own ge76 review.","i find this a bit fishy, because the ge76 was also the reference model used by intel in their ""lab"", i don't want my laptop cpu to go over 100 watts that is insane.",i want to see how these cpu's perform on thinner laptops.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that is assuming amd and nvidia release a mid range card on the 4000/7000 release.",more likely your going to see 4090/4080 until well in 2023. so they build up more defective chips that then can be sold as mid range cards.,"another issue point, is that intel is releasing arc for laptop first.","so even if amd/nvidia release new systems at end of the year, by the time your seeing laptops with 4000/7000 gpu's, your mid 2023 already.","by that time, intel can release a upgraded version to close that gap partially.",then there is the discounts?,you can bet your behind that intel will be offering laptop makers discounts.,"sell a intel cpu laptop, get a discount on the intel gpu.",incentivizing laptop makers even more to stick with intel for mid range ( so less amd systems ).,amd gpu's are as good as dead on laptops anyway( barely any 6600/6700/6800 laptops on the market).,so its more or less a dgpu game between intel and nvidia.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

did you unlock pl of the chip?,i think 76 degrees is normal for a unlocked pl 11400 on cpu intensive games.,"if only gaming, maybe sticking to the 65w would help because it doesnâ€™t take a big hit in gaming performance, only in production tasks when the unlocked pl would help.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm inclined to think its a contact issue because the dark rock 4 is an adequate cooler for 11400 and i would expect around the 60s in games with that setup...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
almost any single tower cooler should be good enough for an 11400 even with the power limits removed.,"you could look at the noctua u12s redux, nh-u12a, or nh-d15s if you want something more premium or the good old cooler master hyper 212 black for a more budget option.",any of these will be able to keep the cpu under 70c under full load.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nah iâ€˜m just not used to temps this high since i had amd before,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"itâ€˜s locked though, havenâ€˜t even thought about unlocking yet",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
contact issue meaning like too less of pressure on the cpu or?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the dark rock 4 should absolutely do the same.,it's not some cheapo stock cooler.,there's definitely something else at play here like poor contact with the cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thatâ€™s weird, the dr4 should be a very good cooler for the 11400. shouldnâ€™t be an issue as weaker coolers can handle the 11400 fine.",maybe check the mounting pressure or something as i donâ€™t think itâ€™s the performance of the cooler affecting the cooling.,you could check if the cpu fan is running at max speed in the bios.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah that.,not enough pressure or even enough contact.,"i would consider remounting the cooler, check the backplate and screws just make sure its all setup right.","when you remove the cooler try to pull it away evenly and check how the thermal paste spread out, if it looks evenly distributed or not.",basically anything to confirm if the cooler is actually pressed flat against the cpu with decent contact.,because if it is i cannot understand 79c temps in gaming with an open case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and even though it's not the sole reason for 75+ in games, in games the gpu will reduce the cpu cooling ability too",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"mounting pressure should be fine, handtight and then screwdriver 1-2 turns.",iâ€˜ll experiment with it tomorrow.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i havenâ€˜t tried a lot of low spec games yet though.,but the games i recently played are all kinda hammering my cpu.,"mordhau, r6, csgo, the forest, god of war, forza horizon 5, modded skyrim, apex & tekken 7. all of those go above 70 degrees with apex being the lowest at 69 degrees max (all games maxed graphic settings except r6 and csgo with mostly low but both still went above 75)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you checked the power consumption and voltage when playing these games?,i only play horizon 3/4 (not 5) and my 11700f uses 50-70 watts at 1.1 volts 4ghz running at 100+fps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yup this had to be it.,i donâ€˜t know why but it was running at 90-100 watts.,"bios was set to water cooling, i changed it to 65 watts and now i get 65 degrees avg and 71+ when playing a bit longer (god of war)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it might be your motherboard's default settings.,(motherboard makers give high default voltages.),when you find 65w not enough in maybe 3 years keep this in mind.,edit: my friend's 11400 is having about 1.25-1.3v at 4.4ghz.,if you have the time to monitor the voltage and/or play with it you can consider checking it out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sounds like an msi board.,cooler type=power limits on msi.,"default will enforce 65w, dualtower and watercooler will remove limits.","65w is fine for games, but will lose performance in heavy multicore loads (like video encoding) and cause the clocks to drop to keep the power usage down.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what games do you play?,are you unhappy with the current performance?,"at 4k, you can likely still see some benefits from upgrading.",i'm thinking more towards better minimum fps and more stable frametimes rather than higher maximum fps.,"if your goal is more fps, i don't think this upgrade would help as much as a gpu upgrade.","as someone who owns basically the same cpu as you, i'm holding out for 13th gen and looking to bump up my core count as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a *good* boost?,likely not in most games.,"at 4k, even with an rtx 3080, the frame rate is most likely going to be limited by the gpu rather than the cpu.","having said that, a lot of games these days are getting cpu intensive and they could bottleneck performance even at lower frame rates.","moreover, if you use dlss you are rendering at a lower resolution than 4k, which will make you run into a cpu bottleneck more frequently in the aforementioned titles.",i'd say a 12600k or even a 12400f would make a very good upgrade going forward.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
definitely an upgrade in terms of fps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"35c idle is normal, and 80c wont cause any issues with lifespan or anything and can be normal depending on the game, but most should be under that.",what size aio is it?,because if its anything under than a 240mm its simply how the build was configured and not anything you can fix unless you can replace it with a larger cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
having a temperature difference between cores is normal.,"it isn't always the case, but lots of times there are imperfections in the ihs or deformation during installation (when you are puting the cpu into the bracket) which results in worse contact pressure over that specific core.",12c is a little bit on the high side but still not abnormal.,"anything below 15c difference is ""fine"".",maybe repasting could do the trick.,"other than that, it's the price you pay for going aio.","that's why i decided to go full air cooling, not looking back anymore.","no troubleshooting, no airflow issues, everything works great.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have a friend who works for intel in arizona.,he has a 2 year degree in electrical engineering i believe.,i forget the specifics but it was shockingly little education for what he does.,he works in their manufacturing department i believe.,he can't or doesn't talk about it much.,"he makes good money, at 21 he was taking home over 40k 15 years ago.",i'm sure it's something north or 60k now.,likely significantly more but conservative estimation.,he really likes it.,he's been with intel since he got out of school and moved to az.,"plus bonus, he gets a free cpu once a year.",so he's always got the good stuff.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a power limited 12700k to fit your cooling solution might still be faster than a 12600k, specially if you take your time to tune the voltages to squeeze the most clocks from a power delimited scenario.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i used an corshair h60v2 ie an 120mm aio to cool my 12700k and it worked very good in everyday workloads.,"even some lighter all core loads such as cpu-z managed to climb the cpu temp to 91-92c while usually at most i saw 74c, well there was some short single core temp upswings to 84c from time to time in some games but i have like 1000 different things running in the background.",so yes an 120aio will suffice even when the cpu is opened up fully if you dont do blender and such.,using an 360rad now so the max temp is lower but overall the daily use is not that much different tempwise.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you can just lower the power limits to 12600k levels,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"replace your case and go with a modern aio if you want a modern cpu, you are artificially hamstringing yourself",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ah so you recommend manually throttling the cpu to prevent overheating and adjust according to the cooler in use.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"that's feels way, way off.",playing gow my 12700k consumes about 70-80w on cinebench 170w.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with underclocking and in gaming scenarios you can make the 120mm work with no performance loss.,"if you plan to use it as a workstation youll thermal throttle, but you can always just decrease pl2 (youll lose 100% all-core performance, but not gaming performance) so it doesnt throttle.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

power limited to 125w, which a 120 aio will be good enough to cool, it retains 99% of its gaming performance and around 85% of its application performance, which is faster than an i5 still.","i reckon the 12700k will behave similarly, and if you find a compromise of undervolt and pl2, the performance loss might even be lower,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yea i been searching for days now.,ended up getting a strix b660-a d4 with my new i5 12400 but somehow ddr4 3600 wonâ€™t boot with xmp enabled.,iâ€™ve tried 3 different kits.,now.,only my 3200mhz kit works with xmp.,was hoping to see someone review this board so i can see if there is any ram issue,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what board you bought?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i saw a community post by him a few days saying he is waiting to do the b660 ramble until more information is known about oc on b660 and better pricing info.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"that's the combo i've been eyeing, but i heard from reviews that the asus h670 boards have terrible onboard audio, so i'd also have to buy a sound card.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
where did you order the 12700 non-k from?,"i havenâ€™t been able to find it yet, at least in the us.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep tried the one in december and eh one that came out in january.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so does this mean i can run 3600 but in gear 2?,how do i run in gear 2 on the asus motherboard if you donâ€™t mind me asking?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bought the same board on amazon.,haven't had the time to build with it yet.,have you?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is there a reason to go h670 instead of b660?,"the msi b660 tomahawk has 3 m.2 slots, 6 sata ports, and good audio",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that's another one i've been eyeing.,"only thing it doesn't have is pcie 5 in that first slot, so it's not the most future proof board.","everything else is damned near perfect though, the rear io alone is better than about half the z690 i've seen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
h670 has more usb ports usually and possibly extra pci slots because more lanes.,obviously depends on exact models too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what ram did you get?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok thanks.,but i guess it defeats the purpose of getting 3600 ram if it runs slower than 3200 on gear 3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh damn, i didn't notice the lack of pcie gen 5. i personally bought the 12700k and z690 tomahawk ddr4, and overclocked it to 4.9 ghz all p core and 3.8 ghz all e core, which isn't much, but at least i tried to justify the additional cost with it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think i saw on intel's website or a youtube video or something that your suppose to put 4 small dots kinda by the corners and 1 half pea size in middle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i used noctua nt-h2 with a short line in the center (probably about the middle third?),and a small dot near each corner.,"i imagine it's a bit unconventional, but if there was any warping of the ihs, it's probably compensating for it better than a manual spread.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah using the 1700 bracket.,was hitting 95-100 pretty quick in cinebench.,no overclock.,with the under volt iâ€™m down to 75-80. iâ€™m new to pc world so donâ€™t know exactly what iâ€™m doing but from all the research iâ€™ve done the under volt was recommended a lot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 1700 bracket seemed a bit flimsy to me.,my noctua bracket from my previous fan was metal and got tight before putting the cooler on.,the galahad bracket was a bit loose until i tightened down the pump.,was yours similar?,i have the uni version of the galahad.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i kinda remember seeing it on a youtube video when i was installing my aio about a week ago.,i was wondering how to add the paste because it's not a square anymore so obviously a dot in the middle can't do what it needs to do.,so i found the video.,this isn't the video i saw but it basically says the same one.,it's a video from noctua explaining how to install lga1700 cpus.,https://youtu.be/--dsrncv2zo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not at all.,i used it on my 7700k before this for about 4 years.,and when i removed the pump when i was changing to the 12600k it wasnt dry at all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you haven't repasted in 3 years?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol there is even reports of the cooler pulling the cpu out of the socket due to being stuck together lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why did you end up going with the galahad?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
those cpus are overvolted like crazy i managed to go down -0.1v and temps -20\*c on 12900k on stock of course.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'm with you.,11+ years on my 2500k overclock to 4.4 for the entire time and no issues.,i revenge upgraded to the 12600k.,so nice to finally upgrade,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i was planning on a top mount as well, but in prior builds i have always mounted to the front or rear.",what case are you using?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"still waiting on the mobo and case, so going to be a few days.","i can tell you this much, i have used aios in my last 3 builds and they have never let me down.","i typically use corsair, so first time with this specific one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice.,yeah big difference between that i5 and the i9 temp wise hah.,"i am a bit nervous about this one, been building for 20 yearsâ€¦ last 3 rigs have been i7s... i7 920, i7 4770k, i7 8700k, and now the i9 12900k.",this one is a different beast entirely.,not sure my roof mounted 360mm galahad will be enough.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
meshify 2 compact.,380mm fan wouldnâ€™t fit on the top so had to do the front.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12700kf 280mm x63 more than enough.,temps doesn't go beyond 67â° on full load no matter what you throw at it.,"here's my build :
https://youtu.be/r0qo9uu4uxy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh so you have the rad in the front with the tubes on top?,as long as the top of the rad is higher than the pump it should be fine.,is it the 360mm or 280mm?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah that's what i thought.,its the 360.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, intels thread director is meant to coordinate thread management between the e cores and p cores on their cpus and with windows scheduler.",it doesn't really do any instruction conversions as far as i know.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"indeed, but i meant, it allows old software to use a key feature of the soc that is the hybrid p/e... without threaddirector, i guess old software will revert to treat all cores identical, no?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rosetta 2 does instruction conversions which allow x86 instructions to be ran on a risc soc while thread director does nothing of the kind.,thread director determines each of the thread capacities per core and gives suggestions to windows' scheduler as to where to place work.,as far as i know apple uses an independent thread scheduler outside of rosetta 2 for handling thread management.,"edit: so yeah, i'm sure apple and intel have a very similar setup managing threads, but rosetta 2 is completely different from thread director.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">indeed, but i meant, it allows old software to use a key feature of the soc that is the hybrid p/e...

software doesn't use a hybrid cpu.","instead, a cpu runs software.",thread director provides runtime information to the os to help with scheduling which core to run on a little more efficiently.,">without threaddirector, i guess old software will revert to treat all cores identical, no?",the operating system decides how to treat cores.,if you run windows 10 they're not scheduled optimally since it doesn't fully support different core types in the same system.,that isn't due to thread director though.,then there is rosetta which is essentially unrelated to any of this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just add to this correct answer, windows 10 and other os's still sees the p cores as ""favored"" cores, a feature intel implemented a few years ago.",but yeah it doesn't communicate with the os the same way that thread director does with windows 11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s not just software itâ€™s hardware thatâ€™s the just the firmware installed and thereâ€™s not a way to disable it since itâ€™s part of the cpu.,amd chips have an equivalent.,since it canâ€™t be disabled best thing to do is keep the firmware up to date.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
by not buying an intel cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
right.,"itâ€™s there, you canâ€™t get rid of it no matter what, even amd has it, so you just gotta live with it.","and the best way to do that is keep the firmware / software up to date so if there is a vulnerability, youâ€™re not exposed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
by making your own open source cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
strange questionâ€¦then i looked at ops post/comment historyâ€¦ðÿ˜…,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it can be disabled but it is not easy and requires near programmer level skills.,if you do you may lose some functionality on the cpu.,you're going to have to google this.,it's very involved.,i looked into it a while back.,i decided it wasn't worth it but depending on your needs maybe it is for you.,there's a few good tutorials on the subject.,just search it and you'll see.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[this forum should help.,](https://www.win-raid.com/f39-intel-management-engine.html),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>keep the firmware up to date.,do you mean the bios?,or the firmware for the me?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i mean sure, but you go from not using intel's ime, to using amd's psp or microsofts pluton by going to amd.",there's no avoiding this situation besides buying really old cpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1984,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
time to switch to risc v then,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'll search a bit more, because before posting here i searched for it but  i didn't really found a way to do it without losing some functionality",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks!,ill check it out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was referring to the intel management engine firmware that should be provided by your mobo manufacturer on the support downloads page.,bios updates are another subject.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"
damn, true.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think it may be hit or miss because all the solutions are hacks and every cpu is different so the directions for one may work for another but not perfectly.,kind of like how you can sometimes get a driver for a similar product to work for your device and other times not.,you can also brick a cpu by doing this so that scared me away.,there's just too many unknowns for me.,i don't have the skill for something like this yet and probably never will.,i really think the generalized tutorials are one of those things where you need to be able to read code to be sure it will work for you.,but it still technically possible.,it has been done by a few people.,if it's a security thing for you and you need to not have me than the government is buying intel cpu's without it ever being installed at all.,you could try hitting up a government surplus auction and see if you can get a cpu with it never installed at all?,idk if the fbi or nsa sells their old computers or scraps them but if they sell them you could try and snag one with no me.,i'm sure the fbi has plenty of computers for non security clearance jobs that still get security conscious computers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hmm never seen a firmware update..only the mei and driver updates.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nvm iâ€™m not paying attention to close wording, itâ€™s just driver update for the ime.","but my point stands that itâ€™s a physical part of the cpu and keeping the driver up to date is a good idea, especially since it is a prime potential attack vector that would give above os level access to hardware, not a huge concern but you do want it on and the drivers up to date.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"unless you plan to do a lot of overclocking or need specific features, that board is way more than enough.","you could easily get away with a $150 b660 or $200 z690 board, youll lose features but a 12600k doesnt *need* such a high end board if you dont care about the extra bells and whistles, but if you do, its more than enough.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ok, thanks.",my thought process was if i get a high end board now i would be able to reap better upgrades with pcie and ddr5 down the road.,the kinda spend now and save later thought.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ddr5 will mostly be relegated to 6000 at the high end for that board.,"you'll need maximus z690 apex, or msi z690 unify-x to have a decent chance of reaping the benefits of ddr5-7000",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"seeing intel's current way of changing chipsets and sockets every 2 years, i would be surprised if they put 14th gen on lga 1700. if u plan to upgrade soon, then get a high end board.",but the 12600k shld be enough for the next 2-3 years (at least imo).,ddr5 isn't gonna be viable soon anyway.,imo it'll take at least 2-3 yrs to mature and get ahead of ddr4 performance.,"so imo, stick to ddr4",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea i figured in 2 years ill upgrade to a better cpu so i figured the mobo will still be relevant then,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in 2 years the mobo may not be relevant with 14th gen but no one knows,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"asus, please enable bclk oc on h610 and give us ddr4 support.","that 12100f will sell like hot cakes being oc-able to 5ghz+, it will smoke everything.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i feel jealous of people's builds.,my build was made in the cheapest case and i don't know anything about cable management so it was one big spaghetti.,on the other hand it worked well for two years so it's not that bad and i don't oc so i don't need extreme airflow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

youâ€™re both right and wrong ðÿ™‚ noctua claims it will fit if you turn it 90â° so it blows towards the top.,"technically right, but good luck finding some ram that will fit under it when turned (it has the ram cut-out in the fins, but that is for mounting in the normal direction).",to mount it like on the picture you need to remove the plastic covering the top part of the vrm.,talking from experienceâ€¦have the rog strix z690-a d4 and the nh-d15.,i simply cut off some of the plastic (â€¦yes on my brand new mobo ðÿ™ˆ) cause i didnâ€™t want to go aio.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i bought nh u12a and i was not able to get it to fit too even after rotating it 90 because of my ram.,i could not fit an aio in my case so i ended up picking nh u9s.,my nh u9s seem to be doing okay 65-80c when gaming.,i have to underclock my cpu to avoid reaching 100c when  doing any cpu intensive task.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"still a good gpu , 3 or 6 gb variant?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd be totally fine with that actually.,as long as nothing is making contact.,it's so disappointing that asus chose to mostly ignore those of us with larger air coolers.,"then again, they and other makers chose to largely ignore making good ddr4 boards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the price of these things has really gone up huh, my 6700k build was around $1100.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i agree!,my older build was full of wires and poor cable management with one blue led fan.,it lasted me 12 years!,i appreciate the aesthetics but not required by any means,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

so no need cutoff/remove vrm heatsink ?,d15 fits well ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ask all the questions ya want!,"lol i switched mine out just cuz i wanted some rgb in them, but i kept the exhaust fan as is.",iâ€™d quite assume theyâ€™ll do the job just fine if you donâ€™t want to switch them!,in the 7000 iâ€™m currently using the stock front fans cuz theyâ€™re 140mm and i have 3-120mm rgb on the side and an aio up top,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if prices of 12th gen i5 and mobo won't drop in the coming 3 months i'm planning to go for core i5 11400 and b560 mobo.,does that seem like an ok decision or does b560 suck that hard?,if so why?,"i'm saying 3 months cuz right now im on a hdd which is really bottlenecking my pc; my mobo only supports sata iii, and i want to buy a nvme ssd, so i'm trying to replace my mobo+cpu at the same time of buying a ssd...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[here's the video version of the interview.,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6nnbokt4eo),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nobody asked the head of overclocking why does enabling xmp voids warranties?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i should have answered your question properly when you asked it.,"intel, amd, and others specify their memory controllers to meet jedec standards.","the standards are absolute - has to be supported all day, every day, at the right specification regardless of the environment.",anything above that is extra.,"vendors will not specify their memory controllers above industry standards unless it causes incompatible conflicts or issues, even if your home system will do it.",that's the whole point of standards.,"we don't tend to overclock the pcie bus, or usb, or ethernet, for the same reason - it's a set of standards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"he deals with how you overclock above xmp, not the binary decision to enable warranties.",that's done several stages up the hierarchy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
was he asked that off the record?,in large corps guys like this can influence people above who make these policies.,"â€œhuh thatâ€™s a good question, let me find outâ€ or â€œunfortunately thatâ€™s above my pay gradeâ€ - they might have the first personality type and get us somewhere ..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they can, but that's the sort of question you ask in a briefing or a side chat, rather than an interview.","also having covered companies like this for 10+ years, you get to learn how it works.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
understand that's why i was curious if you asked him off the record..  :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
idk but i think that's not a problem.,power options - overall plan and command center is for igpu ðÿ¤·ðÿ»â€â™‚ï¸,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with a cpu that old you almost have to go amd because nvidia doesnâ€™t have hardware schedulers so nvidia drivers need 20-30% more cpu power than amd drivers.,honestly wouldnâ€™t bother with anything more powerful than a gtx 1070 if you just have to go nvidia.,youâ€™re still gonna bottleneck in a lot of games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why no amd gpus?,just asking?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sell that crap and buy decent mobo and cpu, i have x5675 oced to 4.2ghz and i am still cpu bottlenecked, my single core speed in cpuz is 360 and new cpu have up to 800 so time for upgrade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"unless you have the fastest cpu in existence for the task at hand clocked as high as it can go, every card will be ""bottlenecked"" to a degree.",use the fastest parts that are compatible with the cpu and platform.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1660 super/ti, 970, 980 ti, 1070 ti, 2060 super is the max i'd say.",x16 pcie 2.0 is equal to x8 pcie 3.0 so i don't see too much pcie bandwidth saturation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
definitely rtx 2060. this cpu can still handle 2080ti.,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ws4pge6telm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ws4pge6telm)

these tests were done at 1080p and the gpu is already pushed pretty high, at 1440p and above it would be basically in perfect balance and at 4k there wouldn't really be much difference between that i7 980 and 12900k.",people seem to always underestimate the importance of the gpu and overestimate the importance of the cpu and the comments under this thread are a good example of it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what motherboard do you have that cpu in?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you want a good pairing for that cpu get a gtx 960 4gb model.,getting anything more you will probably see diminishing returns.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"because i dont have none, while i do have several nvidia at hand i could use.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the main reason i could see is professional support.,amd gpus are really only good for gaming and mining.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"whole point is to sell it, but need to make it usable for person who is going to buy it.",that is why im asking for help.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice but mine will not be oced due 2 things.,its a furnace at stock and i dont have dualfan cooler.,second is psu ... i would need 750 or more powerful psu just to feed that monstrosity of cpu :) its 130w at stock and at 1ghz more is 225-250w :) oh and what you did not hear in that video ... its hella loud.,"thanks for you comment, enjoyed watching that video, learned something new.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"asus x58 generic one, not really sure its even fully featured enough to oc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so.... how does that matter....?,wouldn't ur cpu just bottleneck pretty much any modern gpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah... but i don't think he can do much professional work on a 980x......,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am asking for cpu bottleneck in games.,i want to sell it as cheap gaming rig.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"gtx970/980, gtx 1050ti, gtx 1650 etc etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it matters because i dont want to put a gpu inside a rig that will be mostly unused.,"that is why i want to get one that will be best combo for cpu and work decent in games, and cost me the least.","gtx 960 seems like easiest choice, since it can run most games ok, but if i can put 1060 inside and it has diminishing returns ...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so what, you think that all amd gpus will bottleneck that cpu?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what nvidia gpus do u have rn?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i do remember already writing this, so ill write it again.",i dont have any amd gpus at hand.,"only nvidia, hence i can not even consider amd, because i dont have any.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"960, 980 ti, 1050ti, 1060, 1080 and 2060.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it rly depends on the games you're playing.,valorant makes even my 7700k bottleneck my 1050ti sometimes.,"i'd personally use the 1060 if it's the 6gb, or the 2060",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well i aim to advertise it as a system for fortnite, pubg, bf1, doom etc etc ... isnt valorant supposed to be really easygoing with requirements?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is but it's much more cpu bound than csgo in my experience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i see, well cant win them all i suppose.",thanks btw,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

for that kind of work i would fork out the extra for the 12900k.,the 12700k will do the work just fine but saving a few seconds or minutes here and there will easily pay for itself if you're using it professionally.,"as for ddr4 vs ddr5, i'm unaware of any current motherboards which currently support both so you'll have to decide now which one to go with.",ddr4 is of course considerably cheaper at the moment and the word on the street is that due to the loose timings of the current first-generation ddr5 memory there's little performance benefit in most workloads.,at the same time getting at ddr5 board will give you the option of upgrading to better memory later down the line.,although when that is available is might be time for an upgrade anyway.,see this video for an in-depth performance comparision between ddr4 and ddr5 for alder lake: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu\_w9fzvsso,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

is that heatsink on the back ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

spot on and a good thing to be mindful of.,so many waste so much on unnecessary upgrades.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"all of those numbers are tdp, so they're more comparable then you are assuming.","the 200w figure is the peak power if you disable power limits, not the tdp.","similarly, peak power in those days was also higher than tdp, often much more.","in terms of actual power consumption, the difference is much smaller than the uncapped avx2 stress test results suggest.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would just go for it.,raptor lake will be a refinement to alder lake most likely.,might add more e-cores.,but guessing it won't be the huge performance shift like we have now between 11th gen and 12th.,nice that intel finally made a major architectural change to their platform after the incremental improvements they have made the last few years.,ddr5 and pcie 5 is nice too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'd take the intel 12th gen. either 12700/k/kf/f or a 12900/k/kf/f.,it isn't reasonable to spend 400$ on a 11900k considering a 12700k would probably outperform it for the same price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is literally zero reason for the average i person in the cpu market to by 11th gen today when the 12th gen is outâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"12600k would be better than 11900k for most uses cases, a 12600 + b660 its the best deal, that being said my 12900k performs the same un win11 and 10. if you want a flagship and money isnt a problen get that one nd maybe a b660 board or z690(if money is not a problem).","if your upgrade is for productivity a 10850k is better than a 11900k on multithread and oc beats it in most games, should be cheaper too but still 12600k beats both without any overclocking in any task.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how are prices on the 12700k and 5800x where you live?,both are better cpus than the 11900k and both should be less than 400 i would think.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

more because its an 11700k that costs hundreds of $ more.,you often take these chances of wasting money ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"thanks for the input guys, settled for the 12700kf for $350, it was the best i could find!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the advice.,been doing further research too on the 12700k and it really does seem to be better value.,only thing holding me back a bit is the scheduler issue since i really don't wanna go on win11 yet.,12700kf seems like the most appealing option,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
around 440 to 450 unfortunately.,it's still within budget but i just want to switch to intel now.,currently on an r5 3600 which i'll be giving to my mom to serve as her workstation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wanted to make a major upgrade so i want at least an 8 core since i have r5 3600 atm which i'll be giving to my mom for her work pc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"even disabling ecores, that may or may not trigger scheduling issues, the 12700k is faster than a 11900k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not all users are facing problems with the scheduler tho.,if you want u could disable the e cores.,btw the 12700k and 12700kf are basically the same cpu.,the kf doesn't have an igpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
win10 is fine for scheduler.,some benchmarks show win10 slightly better than win11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12700k is absolutely worth the $40 more over an 11900k.,hell even a 12600k will beat a 11900k.,"but this is what is recommend if possible for your region, get a 12700 or 12700f, which should save you $100ish and b660, which will save another $50ish and forget about overclocking.","you'll save like $150 over a 12700k+z690 and you'll still get 12700k performance, all you miss out is the minor overclocking gains and maybe some premium z690 features.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sorry didnt realize 12600k is 10 cores lol.,i'll check that out too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6 big cores and 4 little cores.,it's about equal to an 8 core.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

in a vacuum they're still great gaming cpus.,"but in the greater ecosystem, the best they could offer was a slight ipc bump over 10th gen, a regression in max multithreaded capabilities, and the elimination of some skylake specific quirks that had persisted for several gens.","now, sandwiched between comet and alder lake, on a one-gen basically dead end platform (z590 etc) rocket lake just looks like an aberration.",i went for the 11900k myself when two 5950x's wouldn't stop bsoding across multiple configurations and hardware swaps.,and i also upgraded that to 12900k with no regrets.,it was adequate but the difference is night and day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a mix of the positives just not outweighing the negatives enough, for example while it did add ipc, it lowered the maximum core-count (10->8) and also added latency, so for many it was either barely any better than comet lake or worse and it was launched in the same year as alder lake.","biggest issue arguably were the fact that the ""i9s"" were ""i9s"" in name only, they were spec for spec identical to the i7s while just being clocked *slightly* higher while being far more expensive (11700 non-k had an all-core turbo of 4.4ghz and had an msrp of $323 while the 11900k had an all-core turbo of 4.8ghz and cost $539, 9% higher clocks for 66%/$216 more), it was kind of like kaby lake all over again, but at least kaby lake didn't offer any regression vs skylake whereas rocket lake did depending on what you were doing with the cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they donâ€™t have great performance uplift from 10th gen, but have an increased feature set.",if choosing between 10th and 11th and prices are the same 11th is a better value when paired with a z590 mobo with 20 pcie lanes to the cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1. the higher core count cpus like the 11700k and 11900k showed regression in some multi threaded tasks due to larger latency between the cores (because the architecture was designed for 10 nm) and in the case of the 11900k you actually get two less cores, so obviously you're not going to beat the 10900k in heavily threaded workloads.",it's really unusual to see regression like this between cpu generations and very disappointing with how much marketing was hyping rocket lake.,"2. the small ipc bump for the lower core count cpus that did work as intended, like the 11600k and 11400f, did not justify their price premium over the previous generation parts.",this was compounded by 10th gen seeing huge price cuts across the entire range around the time of rocket lake's release.,"i went with the 10600k in my build because i would have had to pay 33% more for an extra 10% gaming performance in ideal conditions (1080p medium settings with an rtx 3090), not worth it at all when i'm playing at 1440p with an rtx 3070.","3. rocket lake released in early 2021 due to delays, with alder lake less than 12 months away.","most people don't want to buy into a platform that's going to be superceded in less than 12 months, so it was an odd choice to release the cpus instead of just cancelling them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is a complicated question.,i'd recommend you to not bother yourself with it if it's not really important to you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have an 11900k and it's been totally fine.,"once all the ""waste of sand"" crap was over and people could actually talk about these processors, they're actually pretty dang capable chips.","their lower-end chips are also especially capable like the 11400. it has an overall better feature-set with the platform as well like more dmi lanes to the processor, 20 lanes of pcie 4.0, usb 3.2 gen 2x2 support, new media-features on the new igpu that it has, and icelake-level avx512 for emulators and whatever other software you run into that might utilize it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it was essentially more power hungry than 10th gen and the 5000 series performance did seem much better.,"though right now, a 11400 is probably the best budget gaming chip you could get since b560ms are cheap nowadays.",b660 is still quite a bit more expensive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"personally i think rl is pretty good, except for the power draw that is when the cpu is unrestricted powerwise.",an 11700k is often than not faster than an 5800x in many games when both are tuned to the max and is still faster than 10900k as well in many games.,ofcourse there are some games that love the big fat l3$ of zen3 or 11900k but it is not that bad of a chip and it was a far cheaper cpu than the 5800x.,for me the 11700k and a mobo was just a smudge more â‚¬ than just the 5800x last year when 11700k came out.,"i consider the 11700k as an poor mans 5800x and many amd fanbois should appreciate that kind of products, but they dont and shit all over it even though it should be liked by them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"\- regression of performance and features vs 10th gen

\- same 14 nm process, overstretched so much it couldn't make miracles anymore

\- released 10 month before alder lake, which was already much more appealing by january 2021 than rocket lake.",even intel didn't bother too much in marketing 11th gen and was slowly starting to promote 12th even before 11th gen came out.,"&#x200b;

rocket lake will probably be seen as waste of silicon wafers for most of people (even if it has some positive points such as avx-512)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

>i guess i don't get why the reviews made it out to be such an awful lineup from intel.,the $300 10700k offered nearly identical performance to the $400 11700k.,the 10850k could be had for $350 which matched the $540 11900k in gaming and beat it in productivity.,it really should not be hard for you to understand why rocket lake sucked.,the 11900k was like a 20% more expensive 5800x which we all considered a terrible value already lol.,rocket lake's performance is fine - in a vacuum.,"compared to comet lake and zen3, it was a complete joke.",intel was closer to competing with amd's high end with comet lake than they were with rocket lake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the 11400 and 11600 were pretty good.,"beyond that, there is not much point to get them.","even the 11600k is questionable given the 5600x was almost the same price, and amd had cheaper motherboards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was upgrading from 8700k and wanted to upgrade to a stable and mature platform.,"amd was not it, 10900k still has some bugs (even at stock if really unlucky) so the 11900k made sense to me.",i got a good chip too so it runs very cool with air cooling.,the price and loss of two cores is definitely ridiculous though so it's not like i disagree with the haters completely.,but for me it was *perfect* and i have no regrets to this day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because 10th gen price drops made it an instant no buy.,the 11900k is an 11700k.,"the performance wasn't there against zen3 ( unless you are in the 1% willing to oc )

"but its not, its literary the same.",your example of got i5 not i7 meant you lost cores by doing that.,you didn't lose anything going from 11700k to 11900k.,except money.,it made sense to get 10900k instead of 10700k.,"you got more cores, more cache.",it makes sense to get 12900k instead of 12700k.,"you get more cores, more cache.","it doesn't make sense to get 11900k, you don't get anything.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not enough for you to notice.,youâ€™d have to get a 12th gen chip to see a real difference and even then depending on the game it might not even be noticeable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
z490 also supports pcie4 if you have an 11th gen cpu like the 11700k.,the 10700k is worse in every way.,except maybe power draw.,"the 11700k will use more power, and possibly run a little warmer.",the only thing is that you might have to update your motherboard bios if it's too old to support 11th gen cpus.,"if you bought it recently, it'll likely already be updated.",you'll have to check your bios version and the motherboard website to see at what point they added support for 11th gen. you need at least that version or newer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes.,be careful testing multi core though.,you have to have a pretty decent cooler to make it run.,max was 80 degrees for me on a c14s dual fan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unfortunately you'd need to switch platform to go intel while with amd you can stay on same platform and only change the cpu which is most probably cheaper than swapping platforms.,"if you want the real best gaming cpu you can wait for 5800x3d to be released, it will be expensive yes but gaming performance king lol.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the 9th gen here for reference is a notebook cpu and is about 25% slower than normal 9700k.,so the real world difference probably wont be that big.,"also if you compare it to best 9th gen which was 8c/16t (while 12600k is 10c/16t), the difference will be even smaller.","so yeah, ofc numbers went up, it just did not doubled how it might look like from the screenshot here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

havent tried that yet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mine was 4.9 all p cores at 80 degrees.,i'd say go for a 360mm aio.,however a good one would be the asus ryujin 360,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no since its 4k and that requires a better gpu.,i wouldn't recommend upgrading to a 12600k.,an 8700k is still pretty good in 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what case do you have that in?,"do you live on the north pole, by any chance?","i have a 12600k with an nh-d15 and i've just scored 17,822 with a 4.9/4 overclock at 1.25v.","i need a setting of 1.3v to keep 5ghz/4ghz stable, and the actual max vcore reported by hwmonitor is significantly higher, and my cores hit 100â°c and throttle pretty much as soon as i start running cinebench r23 at those settings.","i'm new to overclocking but i've spent a lot of time fine-tuning this thing and reading guides and stuff, and i just can't seem to get the results i should be getting.","i already repasted the cpu once, and it did improve thermals, but they still seem to be worse than yours by like 20â°c despite having the same hardware.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hmm mine didn't test real well .,it scored a 16951 10 minute test.,temps were good tho.,max temp was 64 but average for p cores was closer to 60 and average for e cores was 49,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's interesting i could go full blast with mild oc on my 12700k with just a nh-u12a air cooler without any issues.,scored a [24554](https://i.imgur.com/svhi0ai.jpg) multi core score and 1995 single core.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

is it really going to be that expensive?,how does it compare to a 12th gen together with mobo and ram prices?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you assemble the system (especially the darkrock) yourself?,"my first thought is the connection between cpu and cooler isnâ€˜t really good, too much thermal paste?",too little?,do you have a good airflow in your case?,1-2 fans in the front and back?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i haven't built mine yet, still waiting on the case and mobo.","i won't be disabling the e-cores though, kind of defeats the purpose of having 12th gen.  i might try to undervolt it though, but it will be used for gaming so i don't think the temps will necessitate that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"gotcha, thanks for the clarification.",you have to admit though 12th gen was huge for intel.,finally the upgrade we have been waiting for from team blue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

do keep in mind op did it for 1 min and you are within margin of error despite that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mine also went full blast but just went alot higher in temps.,what were yours like,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am planning to get the 12600kf do you think the gigabyte  z690 gaming x is good board?,i am on a tight budget.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so if i can barely break 21k with 12700k and custom loop.,thatâ€™s on me?,"asus aioc seems to give too much juice, so at 5,2 it just bluescreens a couple seconds in.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the perf per watt is similar between 5600x and 12600k.,total power consumption is similar to 5800x.,check hub review.,12600k consumes 40-50% more power than 5600x but also performs 40-50% faster in multithreaded workloads.,so perf per was is the same.,in gaming 12600k consumes similar power for more fps than 5800x.,also you donâ€™t need ddr5.,there isnâ€™t much performance difference between ddr4 and ddr5 for now.,5800x3d will be very expensive for an 8 core only chip with no future upgrade path.,itâ€™ll be slower than 12600k in multithreaded workloads and slower than 12900ks in gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep assembled it myself.,"i also thought the connection between cpu and cooler isn't good, but there is no good way to check because if the sheer size of the cooler.",i did make sure all the screws are tight though.,"for thermal paste i did the standard pea size amount, nothing too fancy.","airflow should be good, i have 3 intake, and 3 exhaust.","i'm thinking it's because some of the metal sheets in the cooler are a little bent due to usage (it was used also for my 8600k, had this cooler since late 2018).",maybe it's just time to get a new one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is it necessary to run win11 on it?,wont a lot of programs not be compatible on it tho?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well.,it is huge but maybe not that huge as they are trying to tell us.,"basically they added more cores, power consumption went through the roof and they went for highest possible clocks.",if you take on comparable models with same count of cores/threads (like 11400 vs 12400) you will quickly find out that the raw difference on almost identical base and turbo clocks is like 10%.,and just for comparisson the jump from 10400 to 11400 was somewhere around 15%.,"so in the end yes, it is finally new architecture after all those years but i think from the sole power output it is not that good (and the jump is pretty small even compared 10th and 11th gen).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you sound entitled, cinebench is a useful metric of performance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well lisa su used to tell us that cinebench is the only benchmark that matters.,cinebench was there in all her presentations.,wonder why she isnâ€™t mentioning cinebench since alder lake?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it does, lga1700, but they came in the box.","as for the fans, i can't manually control my cpu fans in real time, wasn't aware that was possible with noctuas.","i don't mind a split-second of thermal ramp-up though, and it usually doesn't actually spike noticeably above what it gets to once the fans hit max.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'd have to run again to remember but i want to say it didn't really stretch past upper 70s to mid 80s on the two preferred cores that i'm running at 5.2ghz constant, most p-cores cores in the upper 70's and e-cores in the upper 50's.",the only time i've managed to thermal throttle a bit was running msi kombuster cpu burner when i was running a 5/5/5/5/5.2/5.2/5/5 + 4/4/4/4 combo with 4.2ghz ring clock.,i remember seeing peak cpu package power spike to 307w and one by one the cores started to hit 100c and i turned it off within 10 seconds.,thankfully nothing i usually ever do with computer comes close to that beating.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the results i posted are with the gigabyte gaming x ddr4 version.,"it's a decent overclocker for cpu, a little buggy with memory overclocking beyond xmp profile and if you're doing a fresh windows 11 install onto an m.2 nvme ssd you need to update the mb bios to f6a first or it won't recognize the m.2 port being populated.",it also doesn't have wifi 6 but i already had a separate wifi 6 pci-e adapter so i didn't care.,"if you don't need the built in wifi, aren't a crazy memory oc'er and don't mind updating bios first if you're using nvme drive for os install, then it's hard to beat for the money.",it has a lot of fast ports and the best vrm setup in that price range (16 +1+2 @ 60a).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
something sounds seriously wrong there.,"i think most people can run in the low 23k range completely stock out of the box...

i would completely reset bios (pull out cmos battery for 10 sec) and try just running things stock again to set some kind of sanity baseline with your setup.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i use a card, like a credit card to space out the thermal paste on the die, so itâ€˜s fully covered.",always worked well.,but is the dark rock 4 that old already?,i mean the model itself.,interesting.,yes you shouldnâ€˜t have temps that high.,even a few bent metal parts shouldnâ€™t make this much of a difference.,the darkrock 4 can handle 200w.,it should be a slight overkill for a non oc 12600k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it is not necessary to run win 11, no.",but win11 is optimized for it because of the advanced scheduler it has integrated which direct tasks to either the p-cores or the e-cores.,"if you are going to run 12th gen, to me going win 11 is the way to go.",but you can get by with win10 if you wanted.,you will probably lose some efficiency by doing so.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i agree with that.,but they finally reduced the die size and rebuilt the architecture instead of giving us the same thing every year with minor improvements over the prior generation.,"i am going from an 8700k to a 12900k, should be a decent leap for me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it never was.,just like 3d marks.,you build around what software your going to use.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i donâ€™t know, and who gives a shit.",i game on my 12900k and i donâ€™t use all core benchmarks as an indicator of performance.,i couldnâ€™t care less about these professional workflows and makes even less sense on this i5.,itâ€™s why my 12900k is 8p cores at 5.5ghz with a 5.0ghz cache.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sounds like the best board for me.,i just turn on xmp and select performance in my asus bios.,i haven't tried manual overclocking nor had the need too.,i am gonna stick to windows 10 for a while.,so if i use a m.2 nvme  for my os i need to update my bios right?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hmm yes i agree it is still an overkill for a 12600k.,mine is also the pro version (dark rock pro 4) which is 2x as thick and has 2x 120mm fans cooling it.,i will try to reapply the thermal paste sometime soon so it's even spread like nutella.,btw is ur cpu indervolted?,and thanks for your replies :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe ill wait a bit to see what the 5800x3d or am4 has to offer.. i aint amd fan tho,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes you can bclk overclock any of those cpus you listed.,"but you need a motherboard with an external clock generator, only a few have been tested, with the cheapest being $200.",on a side note the 12700 with 8c+4c is going to be significantly faster than the 12600 with 6c+0c.,"i'd recommend 12700f>12600kf>12400f and not bother with the 12600.

as for avx512, all z690 boards you buy should support it because the bios versions they launched with support it.",but avx512 isn't a big deal unless you know you need it.,"i've only heard of one game using it, and an emulator, there are some workstation workloads that use it though, but all the 12th gen benchmarks were done with it not enabled, so regardless of avx512 you still are getting the fastest cpus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

pretty much the first cpu performance review i have seen for mobile alder lake.,about +30% to +50%  vs ryzen and intel 11th gen in multithread performance.,"oh, and about +100% power consumption.","where 11th gen hit ~75 watts on productivity, this new alder lake chip hit 130w.","they also limited it to 75w in the review - multithreading performance took a significant hit, but still remained in 1st place by a comfortable margin vs 11th gen and 5000 mobile series.","all in all, they are still under nda for gaming benchmarks, but for cpu the laptop tested boosted stock settings to 130w .","if limited to 75w, performance is still stellar, although if you ask me, 75w is still more that i would want a laptop using for cpu.",looking forward to any testing with a 45 or 50w limit.,i dont get intel.,"even at 75w, single thredad performance was unchanged, head and shoulders above all other cpu.",why did they have to turn power consumption to 11 ?,?,just to get the largest multithread scores?,it is a laptop.,anyway...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm interested in an i7-12800h laptop.,"power consumption, temperatures and battery life should also be better than the i9 model.",i'm interested in intel's deep link feature so i will wait for one equipped with an intel arc gpu.,"due to high power requirement, the ampere gpu architecture has poor performance scaling on laptops anyway.","i usually go with the flagship i9 on desktop, but on laptop i prefer the i7.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it is great for sure, but seeing what apple has been delivering with its own silicon, this doesn't feel very exciting anymore, to me at least.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well the single core power is still < 75w even with the limit set higher.,"having a higher pl2 just means the chip can go there is it needs it for multi-threading, and pl1 will still keep the chip within thermal limits.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 12900h and 12900hk aren't skus they usually sell in gaming laptops, oems prefer the i7s due to better efficiency, while the i9s are meant for mobile workstations, where cpu performance is the only metric that matters to the buyer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intel/amd control the minimum price by setting the price of the socket and chipset (can't make a 40usd board with a 40usd chipset).,the pci-e generation also has some impact.,pci-e gen4 and 5 cost extra to implement due to the very high speeds.,other than that the pricing is upto the motherboard vendors.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so will prices decrease one pci 5 is more common?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not really.,motherboards will eventually go on sale further away from launch but new ones will stay expensive.,"am5 is expected to be a big price increase over am4, because of inflation, component shortage, new socket, etc.",basically the days of cheap motherboards are over.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't think so.,the problem with pci-e 5 is that it just requires more complex motherboards using more expensive materials.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i guess so :(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wouldnâ€™t say that is fair with the way prices are now.,when the 60 series was $200-$300 that made sense but the 50 series is going to be the new most popular card just due to price.,cost of gpu has skyrocketed but people arenâ€™t making more money to compensate for that increase,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if my opinion is worth anything to you i also recommend you wait for the 3050 like some other users.,the cheaper you buy during a time when value is bad the more money you save for another time when value is good.,that's just my way of thinking recommendation if you hate the integrated graphics.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that's usually a sign that the bios/uefi can't find a valid boot loader/os.,"that's the pxe boot loader, a.k.a.",netboot.,"pc's usually default to that as a last resort to find something to boot from the network when all others (hard drive, cd, usb) return nothing.",your hard drive is dead/failing or the boot loader got corrupted.,or (hopefully) just mis-configured boot settings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

cant boot from harddisk or ssd.,go to the bios and take a look if it still finds it.,if its gone its dead..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as others have pointed out the bios is trying to load from the network port, the ethernet or lan port.",this could mean that your normal boot options such as your hard drive / ssd or thumb drive perhaps are not being found by the bios or they are not working correctly.,"however it could also mean, especially if you are at a university or in a workplace, that your bios is looking to boot from the network first because it's picking  up a pxe boot signal.",the simple solution to verify this is to make sure your ethernet cord is unplugged.,as well as the docking station if you have one.,it's almost definitely something wrong with the hard drive or ssd but just want people to be aware that many companies and universities use lan boot and some computers will try and boot to them if they have a network connection present at post.,it can come across as random since it won't happen anywhere else.,hopefully this is some wisdom of the ancients.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

would it be able to keep up with a asus geforce rtx 3060 (strictly for gaming) or is it going to hold it back?,"i am aiming for 100+ fps on most games (1080p) and wondering if it would be able to last for 3 or more years

\+sorry for my bad english",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think a 3060 and 12400 are a good match and 100fps should be achieveable, depends on the graphic settings.",but from a cpu side it should be able to push 100fps without issues.,"i can't look into the future, but 3 years does not sound unreasonable.",worst case you can still upgrade to a 12600k/12700k or 13th gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a 12400 will keep up with a 3070 or even a 3080 pretty well.,as for longevity no one can predict the future.,my guess is the 12 series will age quite well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

12900k doesnâ€™t have wild temps in games thoughâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's does seem to run around 10c more than the 700k.,"we'll within limits, but i am also considering a very quiet build hence preferance for cooler temps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"fyi the asrock board limits to 150w pl1 in bios: https://youtu.be/aavnsqjjuy0?t=345  but should still be okay for gaming, even for 12900k.","however, all core full load like rendering would limit 12700k and 12900k.","not sure if you can unlock power limits with throttlestop or xtu on alder lake, but i always was able to unlock on previous generations on any board.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you are gaming, it's absolute fine.","the z690m itx has 8 \* 50a vrms, that's 400amps.","if you are constantly pegging it at 100% usage using cbr23 or something, then yeah you might need a better mobo.","it's going to work fine, but the vrm temps will probably be a little bit high",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it can matter if you are overclocking.,"however ""8 phase limiting to 150w"" is bullshit.",typical vrm phase has a 40-60a driver which would translate to 300+w maximum for an 8 phase vrm.,"the most efficient power level for an 8 phase vrm would be a lot lower however, somewhere around 150w probably, after that you start to produce a lot more heat so cooling is very important.",vrm cooling on asrock board looks like i would not feel good running a 12900k or 12700k at full power with it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"pretty okey memory scaling test, but i would still like to see some proper ddr4 sticks with good latency in here.",not many hw outlets seems to be willing to really test what ddr4 and alderlake really can do vs ddr5.,this is pretty okey test but those ddr4 sticks are budget ones vs top of the line ddr5.,even if ddr5 is faster than a maxed out dd4 config it kinda gives me the vibes that the content is somewhat skewed without a top of the line ddr4 config.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i stuck with the 64gb of ddr4 3000 i already had and used the difference to overpay for a 3080 which makes a vastly larger difference at 1440p/165hz gaming compared to my 1080 it replaced.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"wait, you are claiming ddr5 4800 cl40 is top of the line ddr5 and ddr4 4000 cl 18 is budget?","i know its not the best ddr 4 out there, but that is the lowest end ddr5 you can get.","i kind of get what you are saying, but accusing them of ""skewing"" results while making obvious biased comments in the same sentence seems disingenuous.","although with ddr5 still being hard to get, and priced at such a premium......i would suggest a ddr4 setup at this point, unless the work you do benefits directly from the faster bandwidth.","&#x200b;

but once it becomes easy to get, i think ddr5 is a no brainer, as any cost benefit of ddr4 will be lost in a year when you need to buy another motherboard, if you plan on getting good ram in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they already done that in the previous test w/ 3200cl14 trident z kits (vs ddr5 6200) .,afaik those have the lowest timings (out of the box) in any ddr4 kit available,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at 600â‚¬ you are better off buying a gpu a tier above and stay in ddr4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you have no budget sure.,otherwise there's far better ways to spend the extra $300-500+ on your build.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"what do you exactly ""tune"" for latency?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's missing for a reason.,good luck getting consistent results between games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"mm i got linked about this test in youtube comments as well, pretty good even though i did not see if they used gear 1 or 2 for ddr4 and they seemed to have used 2t.","but it is very sad that no top tier, ie the most known techtube channels that dares to make such content.",it is as if the bigger channels are pr outlets for companies new gizmos as they dont want to show the best case scenario for the cheaper/older tech or a less beloved company.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
claiming that 4800 is top of the line?,"no but the 5600 and 6200 certainly are vs ""low end"" ddr4 sticks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"+1, definitely think a 4000mhz cl16 set is definitely going to be faster than a 3600mhz cl16 kit.",link to said video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omumzw1atge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not really.,alder lake has issues going farther than 3600 in gear 1. you can use gear 2 but then you really need to push the ram to compensate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
any multiplayer game would give out consistently inconsistent results every run.,"come on, think.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yup, i think it was bz who said that alder lake doesn't want to go farther than 3600 mt/s for ddr4 in gear 1 mode.",so a good 3600 kit is pretty much the max performance you can reasonably get without too much hasle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when you say push the ram to compensate what exactly do you mean by that?,lower the cas latency and see if you can increase the dram frequency higher?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"map rendering and what not is always the same, you donâ€™t need perfect 100% apples to apples comparisons to see that.","you can run the same route, drop in the same spot etc.","cmon on, think.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for all i know, it could be both really.","but from what i've seen, once you're into the ""ridiculously fast"" spectrum, it's easier to increase ram performance by increasing it's speed instead of lowering latencies.",not much investigation has been publicized about ddr4 oc on al.,"but if buildzoid is trustworthy, i recall him saying that in order to get 3600c14 g1 performance in g2 you'll need to be somewhere in the 4800+ mhz range.",at that point might as well buy ddr5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"more or less players on the map, not even on screen would invalid the results.",player proximity may invalid the results.,battles happening not even in screen may invalid the results.,even conection quality may invalid the results.,multiplayer testing is not feasable.,"if you wanna hear reasoning from the horse's mouth:

"while being an important feature for laptops, deep link will also work with non-f cpus of the 11th & 12th gen series on desktop.",they all rely on the same oneapi software stack.,"you simply won't notice the same level of performance scaling on desktop when compared to laptops, as desktop xe-lp igpus are limited to 32eu while alder lake mobile chips have up to 96eu (3 times more).",they even used pictured of desktop alder lake chips during their deep link demo at their ces 2022 keynote https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qxt8b8owzi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you so much for this.,"it sucks we're limited to 32eu, but are the 96 on mobile devices due to the integration of better graphic chips, similar to how one would install a dedicated gpu in a desktop?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"mobile alder lake cpus have less big cores than their desktop counterparts (6p+8e vs 8p+8e), so there is more silicon space available to implement a bigger igpu.",that silicon also contains a native thunderbolt 4 controller which desktop cpus don't have.,intel give laptops a bigger igpu as the overwhelming majority of laptops ship without a dedicated discrete gpu.,it will still be this way even with the introduction of dedicated arc gpus.,not every one will need the discrete gpu but if a laptop happens to have an iris igpu and arc dgpu then deep link is an option that can be enjoyed by the user.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what motherboard brand are you using?,"i just solved a similar phantom 5-beep problem on a gigabyte motherboard, i read this problem is there since the intel 300 series chipsets atleast.","if the motherboard sees that the gpu hasnâ€™t caught a display signal instantly, it bugs out and reports a cpu error, try starting with the gpu installed, but no display cable installed, if no beep, you discovered the problem, so far from my case, the only problem is the noise, the system will run perfectly.","if you want to solve this, open the monitor first before the pc, then gpu will not try to output into nothing and start the bug, otherwise it might be a faulty display cable, maybe the display is just really slow at detecting that a gpu is sending a signal?","i repeat, all of that wall of text is only helpful if it is a gigabyte mobo and it doesnâ€™t do the 5 beeps with the gpu installed without a display cable",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"pretty solid so far, r23 is around 70ish\~, gaming is pretty low",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i saw hardware unboxed do a review of the ram for alder lake yesterday, good watch if you want to really consider your options, but the conclusion is ddr5 is currently pretty pointless.","the price that goes into the ram+board is not worth it, plus the limited supply of ddr5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what do you mean o.o?,"i have no issues with the temps...  
gaming gpu 60ish\~, and cpu is around 60ish\~ as well.",r23 keeps it around 72ish\~,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
around 70ish\~,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got a 3080 asus tuf from the early days before the price got super jacked :d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hmm i got it from [mwave.com.au](https://mwave.com.au).,(i am from australia).,they had the cpu/mobo pretty much day 1 for me to purchase.,stock is plenty down here...prices are a bit crazy for mobo's.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my i7 4790 agrees with you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i prefer to keep the air cool inside for intake to keep the gpu cooler.,"in gaming, gpu sits under 60ish\~, and cpu is around 55-60ish\~",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"pretty good, gaming gpu 60ish\~, and cpu is around 60ish\~ as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think for gpu's..if you missed the launch window price....it aint worth it, this year we might see something come out...and if you can hang in there..just hang in there.",it's not like any of the games that's getting released is any good lol...think god of war is probably the only decent pc release last 12 months.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yea the early bios had issues with xmp as well freaking out, but the bios i had on the board was not even up on the site lol, was a 1 month old one, but i am on f6 now, everything is running fine so far.",i made mine 5.0 just because it was bugging me lol.,"gaming is already running very fast, the extra core clocks is not really needed.","i do find it interesting being undervolted / minor o/c works pretty smooth  
my 3080  is also undervolted and boosts higher lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
kind of where i am at too.,"if you are going latest and greatest, go ddr5.",i almost went ddr4 due to cost but changed my mind and went with ddr5.,prices currently for ddr5 isn't terrible as it is easy more available than it was about 1 to 2 months ago.,the mobos are pricey though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
?,?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is literally no substantial benefit at this time so it donâ€™t make sense to spend insane amounts of money on a ddr5 kit.,"obviously this will probably change in the future just as it has in the past, but right now no one in their right mind should spend that much on a kit unless they have money burning a hole in their pocket.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you know that the 12900k isn't infinitely fast, right?","while it's quite a bit faster than previous generations for gaming, it's still possible to hit bottlenecks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
\+ 12900k has inbuilt mitigations vs 8700k using inefficient patched mitigations which can have an effect on frametime/fps in cpu dependant scenarios.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh, ny temps is a bit higher than yours.",did you undervolt it by any chance ?,or using a different thermal paste other than the one preapplied ?,my case is a corsair 7000d airflow.,i don't have lots of fans like yours but i don't think it's an important factor.,ambient temps around 20-25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's awesome!,now you can forget about upgrading for a while,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, you lucky down there.",itâ€™s nowhere to get in the rest of the world :-(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
care to help a pcmr brother out here in ny?,"ðÿ˜†

this board was the chosen one, and then gigabyte goes and ruins everything.","they don't respond to questions on social media at all, and initial rumors saying the pro ddr4 was delayed due to shipping are now unlikely and it seems this board is never coming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh man your in for a treat then haha.,i think for gamers 12700k is solid choice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very nice indeed!,congratulations!,getting that itch to upgrade since ddr5 is now a thing but i don't think i need it.,got a 9700k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"like i said, i came from a 10900k and i cant feel the difference.","i see the difference in benchmarks but tangible difference that i can measure with my eyes, nope.",nada.,it doesn't mean i'm not happy -- just that i couldn't have held on to my previous setup and been ok.  you might notice slightly more improvements in regular activities and in games going from 6 cores/12 threads more though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you using the lga1700 mounting kit?,read about the concave ihs and the washer mod if you haven't already.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you could do a open case test to see if it drops?,"and yes its undervolted -100mv, it peaks around 1.13v-1.14v on r23",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or until the 40 series launches.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you could say lucky...but the prices are insane here lol..relative to the msrp/usd,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i looked around ozi usual spots, and the ddr4 pro and 5 plenty of stock :o.  price is still pretty high but i specifically went for this board as this is probably as 'premium' as you can get on a ddr4 board.with that said it does an 'ok' job of vrm cooling, but for its price their are other boards that do an excellent job.",its still good board with all the connections you could ever want.,"and it was an easy transition from my old 8700k mobo i also had from gigabyte, all the fan conectors/rgb headers were same place so not much routing needed :d",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i got all by defaut of maximus hero board with mce on.,power peaks around 220-225 during cbr23 test.,"about openning the case i will give it a try
what about thermal paste ?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if its decent upgrade 4sure.,i was on a 1080ti and when the 2080 series came out...the perfm leap was....questionable to the price increase lol.,at least 3080 did launch decent...before everything went to hell.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do some research on the concave ihs issue and alder lake,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have the same aio with noctua push pull.,idle below 30c and full load cb max 80c with a 5.1ghz all core.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

is that in gaming?,or actual cinebench type tests?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"when you take off the pump, what kind of paste spread are you seeing?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is in looped cinebench as i was testing to see if my oc was stable.,i mainly play in 4k so not massive cpu utilisation but my temps never go over 45ish when gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you use other thermal paste (other than the preapplied paste) ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, i repasted with kryonaut extreme.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got stuck on the splash screen when i overclocked and the voltage was too low.,getting stuck can also mean a device connected to the computer is unresponsive like a drive.,"when this happens next open your computer case and take note of the leds on the motherboard, they will light up depending on which step of the power on self test the bios is on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is almost never the cpu.,possibly related to your ssd/drive?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
reset defaults in bios or take out the mb battery.,maybe you got a ram incompaibilty.,is it on the qvl list on the mb website?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that definitely could be, perhaps that could also explain why the problem went away after flushing cmos?","and i never thought about doing that, great advice!",thankfully i have a tempered glass side panel so i can see right in.,def gonna keep an eye out if it happens again,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that was my first thought too, i ran a diagnostic with samsung magician and boot drive is fine, and no more freezes after 2nd cmos flush - weird.",gonna take it tomorrow to run a more detailed diagnostic - we shall see,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"while true shouldn't be overlooked, my first 3700x went bad without any overclocking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well one time i had a cd in the cd drive with bad sectors and it was stuck on the logo for at least 10 minutes.,those cases it will usually give up at trying to read the drive to search for boot sectors eventually.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"fair enough, but diagnostics tools have often told me something is fine that really isnâ€™t.","just keep it in mind if you start having random mysterious crashes, failures to boot, a need to scan the drive, or a need to reinstall the operating system for no real reason.","and even that might seemingly work at first, but then weird problems start cropping up again and you think, maybe iâ€™ll reinstall againâ€¦

if youâ€™re using a sata drive instead of m.2, might pay to check or swap out its data cable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you were correct!,my one of my secondary drives was failing- i replaced it and now its back to normal!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's an m.2, a 980 pro - i just got it so it should be under warranty for a while, worst comes to worst it can be rma'd",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
horray!,:\],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have the same drive myself.,might pay to remove / reinstall it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™d even say itâ€™s too much.,"get a big air cooler, or a solid $100 240-280mm.","(also, the 12700f is worth a look, given the performance difference between them is 5% at most.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"its more than enough unless you plan to overclock or use it as a workstation cpu (100% workload all day), in which point its a good match.",you can easily get away with a 240mm or aircooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe to much but the bright side is the fan noise would be lower due to lower rmps need to maintain temps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for the most part, yes.",but itâ€™s recommended to go with an i5 12400f at this point.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you have a gpu installed, the integrated graphics get disabled automatically.","you can enable it in the bios if you need to, might be called igpu multi monitor or similar.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what happens if you connect the dp/hdmi cable to the motherboard?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you remove your discrete graphics card, it should start working.",otherwise itâ€™s up to the bios to support the functionality of both being active at the same time.,"and it can work with desktop chips - it works beautifully, just like a laptop with dual gpu, on my z690 board running windows 11.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rest easy since its not a big problem i just noticed that the kf dont have and the k have and mine didnt show it yet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh i will look it up then, thanks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it takes the resources from the gpus from there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
il see if i can find anything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"um one more thing youre case made me one more question, if i use the intels grafics for third post video processing  will that make my cpu any higher thermals?",because i have a laptop thats a a15 tuf with a ryzen 7 5800h and rtx 3060 but the processor reaches scary thermals as 78 câº idle and max ive seen so far of 109 câº and the rtx by influence of the processor (the copper tubes are shared by the 2 of them) go to 55 câº at idle and 89 câº at press.,as for the pc in hand the cpu never goes more then 37 câº and gpu gtx 980 (looking for a 3 80) does not go more then  60câº and the secondary which is a gt 1030 does not exeed 45câº.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not sure if the flair is appropriate, but just an interesting read.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel has been spending big and pat gelsinger has been on a tour promoting this every chance he gets.,there are a number of things difficult with intel's position and pat's proposition in today's market.,first issue is that his main competition is fiercely intense.,both samsung and tsmc produce the highly profitable mobile phone cpus.,and there are now more than double the number of mobile phones on this planet than there are pc/laptop units.,somehow 15 billion units in the world despite a global population of only 8 billion people.,intel does not compete in the mobile phone markets and have sold off their mobile phone modem businesses to apple.,intel is championing american manufacturing.,and the american administration has shown already that they will limit american ip to chinese manufacturers and chinese companies.,that is a clear no growth indicator to investors that intel can potentially not be allowing asian manufacturers into their idm 2.0 fabs.,just these two factors make it incredibly difficult to see growth potential in the short to mid terms for intel.,especially considering that it is not cheap to fund and build these fabs and new manufacturing lines.,they do have some light at the end in that they are positioning themselves to build capacity for automobile chips and have autonomous driving technology with existing ties to the auto manufacturers.,"if intel can get around us-china sanctions and allow asian mobile phone designers to manufacture in their fabs, then maybe.",maybe they can become a profitable growth stock.,"but apple, nvidia, amd, qualcomm, mediatek, hisilicon (huawei), and definitely samsung manufacture their chips in asia!",all stocks are doing great due to locating their manufacturing in asia.,i don't see how american manufacturing can be a strong selling point for investors?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'm still on the 6700k and gtx 1070,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"maybe it's my cheap side but if this was for gaming, this was pointless in my opinion.","again, just my opinion from my spending habits.",the 9700k is plenty powerful and jumping on a new platform while still being on ddr4 and coming from such a powerful system already is a no-no for me.,unless of course doing something other than gaming.,cheers on the new build though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just went from a 9900k to a 12700kf and itâ€™s a worthy and noticeable upgrade.,enjoy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
upgraded my daughters to the same cpu and motherboard.,paired it with a rtx 3060. of course i upgraded mine at the same time.,i went with the 12900k and the rtx 3080 ti.,can't have my daughter using better gear than me.....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"idk, i went from 10900k to 12700k and the difference is only noticeable in benchmarks.","mind you i don't render, compute or compress anything.",gaming looked the same barring some higher frames here and there.,"even still, congrats because whatever motivated you to upgrade got me to do the same.",i miss my old rig but i'm happy with my new one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

upgrading already?,what gpu are you coupling it with?,im on the 7700k+1080ti combo and dont feel its worth it yet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

good stuff.,enjoy it!,"i have the same board, chip, and cpu cooler.",love the combo alot!,super stable for me since launch :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a 9700k owner here too!,is it worth it to upgrade if iâ€™m gaming solely on 1440p?,i feel like the difference is not worth buying a whole new motherboard and a bracket for the air cooler and stuff.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

iâ€™m about to go from 7700k to 12700k soon.,this is going to be massive upgrade.,just got myself an evga 3080 ftw3 from a asus 1080 ti oc ðÿ¥º thanks to my friend who snagged it for me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i went from a 9900k to a 12600k.,"similar to others, the 9900k couldnâ€™t get my 3080 to 99-100% at 3440x1440p ultrawide.",now it does reach 100%.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just did the exact same thing 9700k to a 12700k first run on cinebench 23 and the single core speed was almost 50% faster .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at this point it would make more sense to mount the cpu cooler to the case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's nice to actually see improvements in cpu's over the last 3 years!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have 9700k and certain games have been hammering it recently and was debating an upgrade.,what games do you play?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol the 12700k is overkill for the 2070 but still enjoy man!,it's a beast of a cpu!,and maybe you already have an active quest to find a good deal on 3070-3080?,if so then i'd say wait for the next gen of gpu.,i've a 5800x 2070s rig and was eagerly waiting for alderlake but will go with the 13th gen and the 4000 series (used obviously).,i'm betting the next gen of hybrid would be atleast 50% more efficient than this one as they just adopted it so it's only going to get better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
meanwhile here i am with a 7700k waiting for a new chip with even better ipc to come out.,i hate the idea of upgrading so frequently that the difference is barely noticeable.,"seriously, unless you're playing some game that's massively cpu bottlenecked, there shouldn't be any appreciable difference from that transition.","i guess if you have money to blow, whatever.",but i really prefer my upgrades to be a massive blowout so the wait continues on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

10900k is still definitely a capable cpu and would require a lot further development on the gpu side before it truly would be bottlenecking anything.,"anyhow, looking at your specs you have a capable system now that should last you a long time, but as you noticed your past cpu was not really holding  you back.","all these reviews make us think that upgrading cpus actually yields gaming benefits, but one really needs to use unrealistic settings to see any difference between any of the mid to high tier modern cpus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what was the decision to go from a flagship chip down to 2nd tier?,i have a 10850k and i don't think i'll upgrade for at least another two years - does everything i need and then some.,also i'm sure by that time ddr5 will be more reasonably priced with tighter timings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i've got a 10850k  and am moving to the 12700k.,it's already significantly more powerful and the 8 e-cores don't add much.,"the primary reason is the impact of the much higher single thread speeds on performance in flight sim 2020 where even at high resolutions, cpu limitations dictate performance in some situations.",i also produce 4k video and better performance there is a nice side benefit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"re damaged asus lga-1700 cpu socket._x000d_  
on contract for a 3-letter company, my research firm was evaluating the asus proart z690-creator wifi mobo w/lga1700 intel cpu socket for its potential as a standardized scientific and graphics oriented workstation._x000d_  
as part of that project, we initially tested the board's physical aspects and the reliability of the cpu socket and its new retention frame mechanism as it will be used repeatedly with future upgrades._x000d_  
it was in that initial test phase that a severe problem was encountered with the lga-1700 socket and its new retention arm._x000d_  
prior to cpu insertion and retention, we optically measured the alignment of a i9-12900k cpu.",alignment was perfect.,"we used 4 methods to ensure alignment._x000d_  
1. we counted the blocks of pins row and matched the grouping to the cpu nest pins._x000d_  
2. we aligned the cpu as per the traditional small corner diamond._x000d_  
3. optical inspection for exact leveling and alignment._x000d_  
4. the above steps are now superfluous as the 1700 mount now has registration pins at one end the make it  impossible to seat the cpu with incorrect orientation._x000d_  
we then carefully lowered the retention frame to seat the cpu.","we felt some resistance but asus and intel comments noted that the lowering pressure may feel quite stronger than previous mounts._x000d_  
we then began mobo boot testing._x000d_  
after countless tests, we could not get past the 2nd boot process stage led which typically means bad ram.","_x000d_  
we changed the ram and the same thing happened._x000d_  
after several calls to asus, one rep intimated that in such cases at the 2nd led, chances are higher than usual that it may be a motherboard issue rather than the cpu.","it was almost as if the were telegraphing some knowledge of an issue with the lga 1700 socket._x000d_  
after getting an rma we prepared to send in the mobo.","_x000d_  
omg.","when we removed cpu we found the cpu pin nest was totally destroyed._x000d_  
after some additional non-destructive testing whilst watching the action of the cpu retention frame, we discovered the frame was looser than it should be which allowed the frame to misalign, pop up slightly crooked, then press the cpu down at an angle.","_x000d_  
this occurred about 50% of the time._x000d_

ok i stand corrected i guess thanks for that.,i wonder if there's a way to find out how long the cpu pins are so we can math up some numbers on doing the washer mod to find out if the pins will still stay in contact well?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's good to hear since that's what i have in the mail on the way to my house.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i assembled my system today.,"it's an asus strix z690 a ddr4, 12700k with a noctua nh-d15s.",i have my base clock at 4.7 and my peak at 5. i did the washer mod to it.,when pressing down using the cpu socket lever on my mb it seemed much harder than previous intel cpu sockets i've owned.,once the washers were in it was about perfect.,"i placed my washers on inch wide electrical tape, then folded the tape over the top of the washers so both sides were covered and cut off the excess tape.",we'll see what happens.,so far my temps are good but i've read it can take a few days.,only issue i'm having is device manager not recognizing that the chipset and sata drivers are installed.,xmp i & ii worked fine straight away.,i am having a good amount of latency but that may be due to the drivers.,i'll know more in a few days.,i doubt your cooler would have caused bent pins.,my guess is they were bent from the get go.,that said stress testing with an air cooler on these cpu's is not going to go well for long.,my cooler is on the edge of not being able to handle long term high voltage and yours is smaller than mine.,that alone may be the cause.,if you're getting 20 to 30 at idle with no testing that may be normal for you.,i have a low of 23c and a high of 39 atm.,under stress i've seen 40's in the past.,i'm sure if i ran aida64 i'd hit 50 or 60 easy.,maybe more?,i don't know the peculiarities of this chip yet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sounds to me like this whole thing is speculation.,especially around it being specific to gigabyte boards.,i have the same questions though as op.,"i am about to build a 12900k on a asus rog formula, and do not like reading about bent cpus.",i have to think that will break the cpu and the socket.,does anyone have any actual evidence of this happening?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had a z390 aorus pro for the last few years with a 9900k and never had any issues.,now i have a z690 pro with a 12700k with a noctua nhu12a and every core runs almost the tame temp.,thereâ€™s never a hot core compared to the others.,i think the issue is overblown.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i mean, am4 is pga and not lga, there's no latch to force a cpu downward, so of course it won't bend...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not according to the photos iâ€™ve seen.,all the gigabyte retention mechanisms are clearly embossed in the metal with the lotes logo and a lot of other information.,my asus is completely blank and generic.,"maybe thereâ€™s printing elsewhere, but itâ€™s not visible with the cpu installed.","plus some of the design seems slightly different, ie.","where the tabs press on the cpu on the lotes seems more off-center/lower down than on mine, but that could just be the angle of photos.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
reminds me when crypto miners made a big deal out of vram temps and did pad changes.,this made gamers freak out and change their pads needlessly.,now someone says thereâ€™s a bending issue despite intel ihs never really being totally flat for the last few generations even when the die package was square.,"people are freaking out worrying about an issue that youâ€™ll probably never encounter, and if by some chance you do, you can rma it.",i fail to believe that the pressure that the 1700 retention bracket put on the very edge of the ihs is enough to bend the entire thing to where youâ€™re going to get higher temps on certain cores.,if the cpu is under that much pressure to bend you would think it would cause connection issues with the cpu pins but thatâ€™s not happening.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are they denying your rma because of this?,they can argue that bent pins is your fault due to improper installation of the cpu.,which honestly it could have been... never heard of the retention bracket being loose or misaligned like that before.,so either you have really bad luck or you botched the install.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i donâ€™t think itâ€™s specific to gigabyte.,but the examples of people iâ€™ve seen who have said it helped have had lotes brand lga1700 retention brackets.,i have no idea what brand asus is using as itâ€™s not clearly marked like the lotes one.,however i really didnâ€™t feel like i was applying too much pressure when securing the socket.,this might have to do with the rigidity of the actual socket and the rear support bracket as well.,not sure if anyones looked that closely at the variables yet?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's a ""myth"".","well, not a myth.",all cpus through human history were bent.,it has to do with the locking mechanism.,"some cpus are bent in the middle, others on the side.","they won't break or damage, they just won't make good contact with your cooler.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, the cooler screws apply quite a bit of force, so they may bend something.","but i wasn't referring to bending specifically, more like to hardware problems in general.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m like you iâ€™m running a noctua cooler on my 12700kf and all of my core temps are within 1 to 2â°c.,iâ€™m not getting a hot core which would suggest poor cooler contact/bending.,i just donâ€™t see the retention mechanism putting that much pressure on the edge of the cpu to make it band without causing contact issues with the pins.,i didnâ€™t feel the retention arm add any more pressure than what my old the z390 board did either.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean idk.,"3 cores of my 12700k hits 100c under extended full load at 1.3v with a kraken x73, with some mean deltas.",i haven't checked the paste but i work at a datacenter and apply paste to cpus daily so i know how to do it.,have one of these contact frames otw.,"people report 10c differences, and a 10c reduction could easily be the difference between 5.1 all core and 5.2 all core",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

would love to know what thermal paste pattern you have.,you can tell the ones impacted have little paste disruption in the middle of the ihs.,then the question is did the bracket do that or was it like that out of the box?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"thatâ€™s pretty impressive but i know where my problem is, last time i took off the waterblock i saw a pile of thermal paste sitting on the center of the cpu.",i have pretty serious cpu bending issue.,iâ€™m aware of the washer mod but i havenâ€™t had a chance to disassemble everything (huge pita on hard tubing custom loop).,worse case iâ€™ll lap the cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is an impressive stat for an air cooler but clock rates today are not what they were 10 years ago.,by that i mean how long can you cpu hold that clock before it thermal throttles?,i suspect these 12 gen chips will hit that fast with air.,very fast.,maybe as little as 30 seconds in some cases.,so you can't reliably lock the cpu at 5 ghz and leave it there without throttling.,it's just a guess but from the data i've seen on time to thermal soak i don't think i'm wrong or at least not far off.,it seems like water is the only way to sustain a high clock on these cpu's.,but all the water blocks seem to cause this bending issue.,so there's no win atm.,i don't like using the turbo feature on cpu's.,i like to lock them at some reasonably high rate.,for mine maybe 4.3/4.5.,enough that it's snappy as hell but not so much that i'm pushing too much power through it.,i guess time will tell where that is once i mess with it some?,that said 5.6 is is pretty insane for a consumer grade cpu though.,that's a fast fkn cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"at stock, it can reliably run below 70c for ever pretty much.","overclocked to 5.3 ghz all core, yeah it's probably going to throttle, but i use octvb to downclock to 5.2 at 85c and 5.1 at 90c.",but what is the point of running these clocks forever?,"if you are actually running heavy and long workloads you wouldn't run overclocked, so there is that

i think you also misunderstood heat soak.",air cooler need 30seconds to 1 minute to reach their maximum temperature.,"meaning, a 30 sec benchmark and a 10 minute benchmark will give you the same temperature.",that's because they have low thermal capacity.,"on the other hand, water has a huge thermal capacity, which means heat soak is going to happen at 10 minutes.",so temperatures will start low on a watercooler but theyll keep climbing for 10minute until they stabilize there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
h610 loses memory overclocking.,so you lose a small bit of performance there.,"and with a 12400f the differences between the cheaper b660 and more expensive ones wont be performance but features, faster and more usb ports, better onboard audio, 2.5 gigabit ethernet, wifi, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is correct.,faster/more usb connections is a big one.,there's a very cheap $95 asrock b660 board out there that doesn't even have 10gbps usb ports.,it also only has 2 ram slots.,it looks like they figured out a way to make an h610 and a b660 board on an identical (or at least very similar) pcb.,number and speed of m.2 slots is also a big one to look for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for the 12400 it's not.,you can run it at full power on any board because of how little power it uses.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes but so far that is limited to the more expensive boards because it needs an external clock generator.,"it definitely increases performance, but it doesn't increase performance per dollar.","like op is asking about h610 and cheap b660, so he's probably wanting to spend around $120 on a mobo.","the cheapest b660 board that has been confirmed to do bclk so far is $200, which is a large price increase over a basic board.","i don't think that's a bad route to take, as you do get more features beyond just the bclk overclocking, but it's not really the most budget friendly option.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

jesus.,so youâ€™re playing cpu bound constantly?,why?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s cs go dude literally any card from 20series onwards will make the game cpu bounded,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
first of all this game is completely cpu bound.,furthermore i like playing at 4:3 stretched resolution because of bigger player models.,so this makes it even more cpu bound.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you know your sensetivity , fov and monitor picture in general stretches too, right ?","not just the player models

~~it's an old myth that was created due to the lack of 16:9 displays among players while cs 1.6 was popular.","it has nothing to do with the player performance and overal accuracy, some players kept using 4:3 just because their sensetivity and fov changes with resolution.","most of the pro, and completive players have moved to the higher resolutions because it's higher fov is what really gives the advantage in those games.~~

same for 400 dpi which has inferior responsiveness to the higher values.",you should've invested in faster cpu and the monitor rather than a graphics card if you're that serious about competitive cs:go.,"and also, the rtx 30xx gpus have issues with lower resolutions, they perform worse than they should on resolutions lower than 1440p.","3070 has the same performase as 2080 super in 1080(even though it works much better at uhd and qhd)

i do abnormal things with my pc's.,"music, recording etc.",i have chosen top end of the mid range for my last two computers 5800x and a 12700k and the performance has been fine.,the only people who need an i9 are probably scientists or video creators and such.,i used to buy top end cpu's.,i stopped around 2010. by then mid range cpu's were fast enough to do what i needed and the top end chips had become ridiculously expensive.,i could probably get by just fine with an i5.,partly i just like having a really snappy computer.,i want ultra fast response times to live musical input.,the midrange cpu's do that without shelling out a ton of money these days.,it used to be that there was a serious difference between the low end and the high.,that is not the case anymore.,an i5 is basically just a shrunk down i9 with slightly less capable cores.,but the difference is probably 1/3 ghz and a few p&e cores.,4.9 vs 5.2. it used to be hyperthreading vs no hyperthreading.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'd go for something a little above that budget like the cryorig h7.,"https://www.globaldata.pt/cooler-cpu-cryorig-h7-cryorigh7

asking the real questionsâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for the reply!,i'll see if i can get one of those.,"under 30â‚¬, would you recomend anything?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hi!,thank you for the reply!,wouldn't the cr-1000 perform similar to the hyper 212?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hi, sorry for the late reply.",i have couple of arctic p12s that i can use and mount on the cr-1000.,wouldn't it have the same or better performance than the ones you mentioned?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is 100â‚¬ in portugal where the op is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"im not familiar with the jonsbo brand, but it should be similar, both are 120mm.","however one thing to note the link you shared for cr-1000 shows ""nã­vel de ruã­do (db-a) 	20.55-37.2dba"" while on the cooler master website it says ""8 - 27 dba"" for the evo 2. 

so the hyper 212 might be more silent!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i actually have some arctic p12s that i can use and replace the fan that comes with the cr-1000, which might help with noise and even temps!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hi again.,"yes, they are pwm.",so 2 of them along with the cr-1000 heatsink would have a good performance with a non oced 10700k right?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ok ok. thank you for your help!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then wouldn't that also mean the celeron would need a name change?,"what're they going to call that, the core i-1?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
meanwhile i think intel should drop the entire core i branding because it has become basically meaningless at this point and come up with something new.,it has gotten to the point now where someone could say they have a core i7 and it could mean anything from a dual core laptop cpu all the way upto a 10 core workstation cpu and everything in between.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
driver problem.,ethernet related probably.,"downgrade/upgrade/uninstall

if it's a hardware fault (probably not if it works) try replacing mobo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you need to make sure you have every driver downloaded and installed for that motherboard on asusâ€™s site.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i would try updating the network driver from the companyâ€™s siteâ€¦if itâ€™s a gigabyte ethernet adapter, than make sure you download it and install that driverâ€¦not the one windows wants.",if itâ€™s realtekâ€¦than go to realtek and get the driver for it.,edit:  looks like an intelâ€¦so go their site and download the windows network driver for that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
edit: after 3 days i got my first freeze i guess the audio driver was not the issue.,i found multiple post about z690 motherboard freezing and stuttering when gaming.,i guess wait for a new driver updates or try a new motherboard.,not sure if we have the same issue but i have stuttering and freezing issues with my asus strix z690a.,when it stutter i temporary lose control of all usb devices and the onboard network card will lose connection.,freezing for me only occurs couple seconds after closing a game or stopping a render.,i think i fixed my freezing issue by uninstalling asus realtek audio driver.,the audio driver comes bundled with sonic studio and i heard that causes pc to freeze.,i uninstall the realtek driver and sonic studio and my freeze seem to went away.,not sure it help with my stuttering issue since i am still losing usb and network connection sometimes.,i am having a feeling it might be cause by the xhci usb driver.,or you can get a new motherboard and see if it was just a fault motherboard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its a ram issue with z690 asus mobo series.,set ram clocks to default (2133 or 2400) and give it a try.,i have a huge thread regarding this on asus subreddit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i disabled c-states in bios.,i haven't tested it extensively.,maybe you can try that and see if that helps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh god damn.,will this mean i will have to invest in a new motherboard if i want to run my 3200mhz on ram?,or will there be updates to the mother board in the future?,"thx alot, and i will go read your thread to get a better understanding!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
check the motherboard qvl just in case your ram sticks are not supported.,"the amount of sticks matters too, sometimes it wills support 2 at most of certain capacity.","make sure drivers are up to date through armoury crate or asus's website and windows update, ultimately you can do a fresh windows install.","also bios updates, try a few and see if it's the cause, some bios updates can cause failure if your ram sticks are not supported.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nvm you literally wrote it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for now it looks like my pc is running fine with the default clock speed at 2400. i will give an update if anything happens!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why even disable e-cores?,i found mine doing trivial tasks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you are disabling ecores, perhaps a 12400 would make a better build, deb8uer just showed off 5ghz with bclk oc at much lower temps and power consumption on a b660 motherboard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
running a 12700k with an undervolt at stock clocks.,tdp is around 145w with cb r23.,e cores enabled.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
isn't the whole point of alder lake is it's efficiency?,like i thought it's suppose to use small cores for for little processes and big cores for big processes?,i guess what i'm saying is what's the point of it if one still has to undervolt and tweak all kinds of bios settings to get it to work the way it should?,fees like it defeats the purpose almost.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what sort of pl1/pl2 values are you running?,i thought thatâ€™s the biggest factor when it comes to making alderlake more efficient.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my 12900kf seems to be p95-stable at 1.140v, i'm undervolting via v/f and also utilizing vdroop a lot.",80â°c max using 226w max with smal ffts.,"cb23 runs at 1.52v with standard clock and results, maxing out at 73â°c on a lfii 280 with the washer mod.",about 200w draw in cb23.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not really sure why you even went 12th gen if you arenâ€™t even going to use the architecture the way it was designed.,why not go 10900k and save some money.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
higher cache speed.,only used for gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"maybe not, if he disabled e cores i guess he does something which is memory latency bound.",the bigger l3 cache in i7/i9s help a bit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, the point of e cores is not efficiency in terms of power consumption.",they are efficient in terms of die space.,"also, doesn't matter how efficient something is, what's wrong with making it even more efficient?","im running a 12900k on a u12a with a 0.1 undervolt, running whisper quiet",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

dude 1.52v is not a healthy voltage do you mean 1.25?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
had a 10900k that died.,the 12700k e-cores off slaps the old 10900k out of the water in synthetic benches.,and you can also run the ring higher with the e-cores disabled.,better for gaming,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah that's true, games would still run faster on the 12700k with e-cores disabled",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
correct.,only using this machine for gaming.,no need for the full mt performance tbh.,"was playing around disabling ht as well, but when undervolting, it didn't give me as much as when pushing it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"12700k here on nh-d15, with 0.75 undervolt.",also running \[below\]whisper quiet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you get that even with the ecores disabled?,something isnâ€™t right there.,almost certainly a mounting issue.,"my 12900k is sitting in a box waiting to be installed, waiting on the mobo and case.",going to cool it with a lian li galahad 360mm aio,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

was it bent out of the box or did the retention bracket bend it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
retention.. was using a nh-u12a until my new mounting came in from germany.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"11900k gets hot under heavy loads, and the cyberpunk crowd 'simulation' can be a heavy hitter.",try turning down crowd density and see if that improves thermals.,"and probably not the answer you want, but unless it's thermal throttling at 100c, having one game run hotter than the rest is fine, 90c won't cause any damage or anything, and clearly the cpu is being used more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

for a air cooler u seem right where it should be.,iâ€™m on custom loop same board and chip 5.2ghz all core 1.32 85 on hottest core and 64 on coolest on stock i donâ€™t hit above 48c.,"paste wise, mx5 and mx4 got me the same results as kpx and thermal grizzly kryonaut extremeâ€¦ so ur fine.",if u wanna go higher itâ€™s all about good contact and water cooling.,but to be honest not much to gain higher up.,i can do 5.3 but no change in game performance.,"u will get more out of overclocking ur mem and cache turn off ecores too, that helps a lot",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that pattern does not exist while cooler is on the cpu.,pattern there exist now because you are dismount the cooler.,that pattern means your thermal paste evenly touched cpu and cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

more information - the cooler is a low profile big shuriken 3 - and my package is around \~90c after 10 minutes of cinebench.,"score is above almost all 12700k reviews, so the cpu definitely does not throttle.",while gaming cpu sits comfortably around 65-70c with fan around 50%.,"it seems like the thermal paste pattern isn't ideal - but on the other hand, the cooler can't take much heat anyways, so i think it won't actually help me to improve the thermal connectivity between the cooler and the ihs.",what do you guys think?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i like ur ram :d  cuz i have em my self,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lookup the washer mod on youtube.,looks like you could get lower temps looking at that spread.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™d go by the pattern on the actual underside of the heat sink.,the heat sink is being tightened down so more of the paste would technically be stuck to the underside of that especially when you separate the cpu from the heat sink.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">the cooler is a low profile big shuriken 3 - and my package is around ~90c after 10 minutes of cinebench

i think that's as good as you're going to get using a ""low profile"" downdraft cooler on this kind of cpu.",you can maintain performance and improve thermals even further by undervolting.,lots of resources out there to show you how to do this.,i'm able to run a stable -70mv on my 12700k which improved all-core full load temperatures by almost a full 10c (10 min cinebench avg temps went from 81c to 71c).,"you might be able to go even lower; some people are able to go -100mv to -150mv, it just depends on the manufacturing variance in your particular cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the thermal paste pattern isn't bad, the center where the die is has good contact and the surrounding area isn't terribly gloopy.","it could be better but your not going to drop like 5c with a repaste using the same paste, maybe 2c.",with a low profile single fan cooler your pretty much getting as expected.,"no thermal throttling under 100% all-core (cinebench) with some decent wiggle room when the seasons change, means your pretty much good to go.",so i wouldn't bother with it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you don't mind me asking do you know your power consumption (either in cinebench or pl1+pl2)?,"i'm considering getting a big shuriken 3 for my 12700k and the thermals your getting seem good enough for me, but i'm just curious if you've had to set a specific cpu limit to get them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you canâ€™t see if thereâ€™s bending or not from the photo provided and if there is any it would be very hard to see with the naked eye.,you could  measure the â€œbendâ€ with a flatness gauge but it amounts to millimeters.,"the washer mod works because of the way 12 gen mobos secure the cpu in the socket, by means of pushing down primary on the center of chip.","the mod tries to stop some of the force being applied to the center so there is more of an even spread on the clamp holding the cpu in place allowing for a flatter (not necessarily flat, but depending on the cooling solution, a better curve supplying more contact) surface for the cooling solution to make contact with.",i suggested the op check out the mod on youtube which might help temps or might not because it seems from the one photo provided that the thermal paste is being spread away from the center and onto the edges due to the socket clamping mechanism.,just trying to help here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have a gahalad, no big issues with sound, do you mean the coilwhine?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mainly the fact that 12th gen gets really hot and kryonaut get very thin at 80â°.,hydronaut would be a longer lasting solution.,also i have never heard of pump out from liquid metal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"typically the ones that have shown 'bending' show the thermal paste 'pooling' in the middle at the bottom of the bend, with little to none on each end.","based on the thermal paste pattern, that doesn't appear to be the issue in this case",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what about 100% fan speed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"personally i'd do it for them all... it's still a fairly new cpu, i can imagine most of them bending over the period of a few years.",hopefully i'm wrong but that's my take on it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"aah yes, everything makes noise at 100% lol.",for me they only run at 100% with long heavy workloads like benchmarking.,otherwise my fan curve will prevent it.,i also have a 5800x hothead.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pump out comes from change in consistence.,so the thermal cycling makes it expand and retract.,you have to redo liquid metal on copper coolers because it will absorb it.,that's why people de-lid with it because it doesn't squeeze out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
doing the washer mod if you don't have the bending problem is a bad idea.,the socket is designed to have that much clamping force.,reducing it without a good reason is asking for trouble.,in this case the op has fairly even paste after compression and very reasonable temps given his small heatsink.,"there is no problem, so no sense risking creating one!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well you might as well buy a evga clc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
reason i did it is to prevent the cpu from bending in the first place.,i compared my temps to those i've seen online and mine do seem better across the board by a few degrees too.,"there isn't any risk unless you accidentally drop something on the pins while doing it, or overtighten the ilm screws.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's less than 4k, so yes should work on most modern hardware, especially with dp.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
does it support 120hz ?,so far i see my nuc does not work with 120..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so if itâ€™s only about the total number of pixel?,not specific resolutions.,do you know if the hz can increase if the resolution goes down?,like 4k@60hz -> 2k@120hz?,i could not find anything about whether the iris xe supports 120hz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thanks!,"also, will buying an 11600 and using it with a b560 be the same as using an 11600k with a b560?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you but honestly i've seen many comments like this and they don't help.,i would much rather an answer to my question.,"talking about 12th gen though, how is the difference on 12th gen between k and non-k cpus and between b660 and z690?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what you say is very logical but iâ€™m just confused.,that would mean an 11600 would be the same cpu as an 11600k just not overclockable.,however there is a big price difference between these models and since even the stock results of 11600k is so great then why isnâ€™t the 11600 much more popular?,also i checked intel ark and the base frequency of 11600 is 2.80 ghz while 11600kâ€˜s is 3.90 ghz further suggesting they are different cpus even at stock.,can anyone explain this further because iâ€™m really indecisive between the two.,(also for the people saying 12th gen is a better value: due to inflation in my country prices went up 50% on all imports including cpus so 11th gen is actually a better value here in turkey),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i understand, thank you for everything.","by the way about the inflation, dollar to tl exchange rate increased so all the imports increased with it meaning the price in dollars was the same.",itâ€™s the price in tl that matters :).,"because 11th gen was imported before, of course some stores took advantage of the situation and raised the prices of old cpus as well but you can find an 11600k for 3000 tl.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

honestly wondering this myself!,"this, for me personally, is the biggest question mark on intel's xe-hpg cards - software/driver support.","it's one thing to make a good hardware, then another entirely to maintain good software support.","with the vast resources intel has at hand, this shouldn't be a problem so i hope we see some fixes sooner rather than later here!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

do you just not bother researching anything?,the 4800 has twice the cores resulting in twice the available threads of an 1195â€¦ the integrated xe graphics of the 1195 may on paper have more performance than the vega 7 of the ryzen until you realize integrated graphics are integratedâ€¦ it takes up resources resulting in the intel having even less than half the available cores/threads the ryzen has for cpu workloads the game can utilizeâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks for your support

that hasnâ€™t stopped them from supporting the shitstorm thatâ€™s 2042.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

completely missing op never mentioning using a discreet gpu while explicitly mentioning using intel xe.,a intel cpu integrated gpu which very much exclusively uses the cpuâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel integrated gpus haven't been using cpu threads since the hd series began.,"you're thinking of a graphics accelerator, which intel and amd used in the past.","intel igpus are full-fledged gpus, just like amd igpus are full-fledged gpus.",they're just weaker than the typical gpu you buy off the shelf.,"&#x200b;

this doesn't mean using an igpu doesn't cause cpu utilization in-game to display graphics, it just means there won't be any more cpu utilization than any other graphics card.","&#x200b;

the only way an igpu can slow down a cpu isn't by using its threads, rather by using memory bandwidth, power or causing the package to thermal throttle.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no problem.,"let me explain it in more details: 

a graphics card like the 3080 is very powerful and has no trouble rendering games at 1080p at very high framerates and not breaking a sweat.","it doesn't reach 100%, utilization because the game doesn't push the harder to its max.","now, try to game at 4k and things change.",the card is still great at 4k but more often than not it will sit at 100% usage because it has to work more to render 4k stuff than 1080p stuff using the same cpu.,"as long as the cpu can keep the gpu fed with data, there is no benefit in upgrading the cpu.",your 12700k is already the second best gaming cpu and will not cause any issues.,"going to a 12900k may give you a small fps boost, but nothing that justifies the extra cost if all you do is game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the i3-12100 is nearly twice as fast in multithreaded workloads, 60% faster in single thread/gaming than the 2400g.",so a pretty huge improvement.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i don't think the 2400g was ever on par with even like the i7-4790k, to begin with.",it's a 4-core / 8-thread zen 1 chip with 4mb l3 cache.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2400g was a little closer than you might think - although it was zen 1 it had the cache latency â€˜fixâ€™ that threadripper (based on zen 1) and zen+ had that helped greatly with performance.,it just didnâ€™t have the higher clock speeds than 12nm (zen+) brought over 14nm (zen 1).,you can see this in cinebench r20/r23 where 2400g had higher single thread performance than 1800x.,application wise 2400g was more like a 4770k but sometimes a little faster.,4790k definitely faster but not hugely so.,games though i assume 4790k was appreciably faster than 2400g.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there won't be much difference.,wait for fast and affordable ddr5 and upgrade to 12th gen. that'll be a much bigger jump.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not particularly worth it for gaming.,it is already a very good gaming cpu.,you likely won't notice a difference unless you are playing very cpu heavy games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you tried overclocking the 10600k?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
better 13th gen. those things will have a lot more of ecores.,i7 13700 will have the same corecount of i9 12900.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mostly play tarkov,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"unfortunately i am not able to do the oc, my cpu has the basic oc that reaches up to 4.8ghz",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"extra e-cores won't make a difference in gaming though, unless you run out of p-cores, but that won't happen on a 12700k.","so if someone is buying a cpu for gaming soon, the 12700k/12700f is ideal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so i read tarkov is a pretty cpu/ram heavy game.,"but your 10600k is still quite strong and is only roughly 10-15% slower on single core performance when comparing it to the 11700k: https://www.cpu-monkey.com/en/compare_cpu-intel_core_i5_10600k-1141-vs-intel_core_i7_11700k-1862

the 11700k is a decently fast cpu, and is definitely a big upgrade over the 10600k for multithreaded applications.",but this doesn't generally apply for gaming.,"games tend to be highly single-threaded, so when looking for a new gaming processor we usually want higher single core performance.",i'd say upgrading to a 11700k wouldn't be worth it for gaming.,"you could likely overclock your 10600k to have similar single core performance to the 11700k, and this would only cost you a decent cpu cooler ($50) instead of hundreds to upgrade the cpu.","if you are actually maxing out your cpu while gaming (i.e 80~100% usage) then sure, the 11700k would give you a lot more breathing room, and i would advise an upgrade.",but you also need to consider that the 11700k would basically be the end of your upgrade path.,"it would cost more money, but you could buy a new motherboard + 12th gen intel cpu to avoid being stuck on a dead-end platform.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"okok thanks, i would have made the change with 11700k for 100 â‚¬, for this reason i was wondering if it was worth it.","unfortunately i don't know how to do the oc, i have the basic active oc, it reaches up to 4.8ghz",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that seems to be a very good price.,i'd say it's worth it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"between i7 10700k and i7 11700k, what would you recommend?",i have read that the 10700k is more performing.,both have the same cost,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it is safe afaik.,me and my friends have been using it for quite a long time.,and not everyone has cash to buy games my man.,we as 15/16 yr old need to take permission from parents.,"and being indian parents, they rarely allow",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

back in the day i used to use a gma fixer.,or something like that (google it) for minecraft.,you can only run version 1.13 and older on gma cards.,of course you really should just buy a cheap gpu from ebay or switch out the system.,"especially since it is still running windows 7, which is out of support and a security hazard if connected to the internet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"oh, that could go to the graphics card that's in the pc then",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there it is, that's the gpu.",so that means there is no graphics card on that pc but there is an integrated gpu built into the motherboard.,"like i said, gmas are old and unsupported.",so they can't run minecraft anymore unless you know some workarounds here and there.,"and even if it's happens, u need optifine to get 30-40 fps at best",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

even if you got it to 5 ghz the i3-12100 is still more than double the performance than it.,you'd be far better off building a system around the g6900 which can be had for $60.,"when they overclocked it, it beat 10900k single core haha.",https://hothardware.com/news/intel-budget-celeron-g6900-alder-lake-cpu-leaked-benchmark,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i get that but... i won't be able to stomach the price hike of gpus evrywhere else in the world..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no.,such decision will depend on the popularity of intel cards.,generally aio manufacturers announce waterblock designs a few weeks after a card is officially launched.,i don't remember any of them announcing a product prior the launch of the targeted gpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not exactly how that works though.,"its not like amd is using 100% of tsmc's supply, there are tons of other products and companies using leading edge.",like amd is using <5% of tsmcs leading edge for gpus.,"tsmcs supply isnt bad, but amd is splitting their supply with consoles, cpus, gpu's, etc and didnt book enough supply before the pandemic.","with intel coming in, it wouldnt take existing supply from amd.","this contract wouldve been negotiated before the pandemic for whatever volume intel wanted, so its already been allocated to them and completely separate of existing contracts.","so yes, intel joining will actually help increase the amount of gpu's in the market.",but it wont be some miracle like if intel had used their own foundries and were able to pump out millions of gpus on intel 7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i don't see why anyone who makes an intel chipset motherboard already wouldn't be offered the opportunity.,all the agreements are already made.,they have the capability.,it's just whether they want to allocate capacity to it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they will probably have decent pricing, but will sell out.","everyone will be curious as to how it performs for them, and to them, they can return it if it sucks... so, people will buy without giving it a second thought knowing the stock situation is bad.","hopefully by then the stock situation is better so that doesn't happen, but we will see.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"getting affordable dedicated gpus on the market is progress, even if it's 14nm.",pc gaming is going to die (or take major losses) because the price of entry is absolutely atrocious.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> 14nm excess capacity

most of their 14nm capacity will be converted to 10nm (now intel 7nm) given time.",remember that intel converted some of their fabs back to 14nm when 10nm didn't pan out originally in a fairly short time frame?,that is about as interchangable as you can ever expect fabs to be between nodes.,intel 7 will be a extremely long lived node due to being the last full duv node and uses mainly the same equipment as 14nm.,i don't see them wanting to tape out new stuff on 14nm as a result.,"they will be ramping intel 7 as hard as they can, which means excess 14nm capacity is going away.","this is also why we now see so much spending for fabs, it's not just the shortages.",with the large investments into euv you need new fab space and can't just upgrade the old ones as easily as some other node transitions in the past 10 years.,so if you wanted to reuse the old fabs you would have to rebuild them and to large scale refurbish/changes rather than just upgrades.,much easier then to just build new fabs that also doesn't interfere with your current capacity by shutting down your current fabs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
steam has good anti-bot / anti-non-customer measures since it's mainly just gamers and through a plethora of requirements they can just restrict the purchase to what are most likely legitimate customers... they did this for the steam deck preorders.,"if intel surprised everyone with a steam distribution of it, then all of a sudden there's a chance many of us can have a fair shake at getting the cards.","of course, an avid gamer could just buy it to scalp regardless, so there's always that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i am the one that brought up the idea of intel collaborating with valve to get arc dgpus sold via steam, i'm happy that my idea caught the attention of some intel employees

steam has a hardware category https://store.steampowered.com/tags/en/hardware and steam has a pretty good system to weed out scalpers, bots, etc.",it's not perfect but it's far better than most.,"valve used to sell their steam controllers, steam link and steam machines on there, i'm surprised that the steam deck is not listed though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"damn, was hoping at least aio's were announced usually gives an idea if blocks are coming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nv is using samsung's 8nm and they have a lot more supply than amd... they are still in shortage.,miners buy up everything.,intel could produce 10 times the volume of the current amd+nv supply and we would still have a shortage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">there is plenty of room to shift around capacity for intel to make just as many gpus

yeah i rmb reading a report somewhere that tsmc converted one of their research labs/centres into a fab plant for intel, so i don't think semiconductor supply for other companies(e.g.","apple, amd) are affected, they seem to have just 'increased' production",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sweet summer child, a company will never do that.",currently anything near a 3070 performance goes for nearly 1k.,so undercutting means below that but mark my words it will never be below the 3070 msrp for the top sku.,these times are over.,"and even if they proposed a msrp below that, you will never see the actual lower price, demand will create a different street price much higher than the manufacturer suggests",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'd say by druid they'd hopefully have it on intel 3 or something along those lines.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> avid gamer could just buy it to scalp regardless

certainly, though it's a matter of scale.",i'd rather have a chance at getting ~90% of the cards being in the hands of gamers vs whatever we have now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that avid gamer can only buy 1 per account.,which was the main issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the difference is steam is selling the steam deck directly and they've sold all their other hardware products directly.,intel doesn't really sell to the typical consumer directly for the most part.,they sell through partners.,so most of their stock is going to retailers like newegg that doesn't give a shit on who buys it because they get their cut either way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>miners buy up everything.,"intel could produce 10 times the volume of the current amd+nv supply and we would still have a shortage._x000d_

thankfully, this isn't true.",eth network hashrate is currently around 1 petahash/second.,"you can do that with 15 million 3070s, which is roughly the median desktop gpu produced this generation.","amd and nvidia combined to produce over 40 million gpus in 2021, and miners are making use of a fair bit of older hardware, too.","doubling the number of gpus in service halves the return to each gpu, so it halves the price miners are willing to pay.","if intel supplied 400 million gpus, and crypto prices remained the same, miners would bid much less than msrp for each.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> miners buy up everything.,intel could produce 10 times the volume of the current amd+nv supply and we would still have a shortage.,"no, there is a very finite amount of gpus that miners will absorb based on the current total mining rewards.",that is then today mainly dictated by the price of eth.,"it may seem like a bottomless pit when crypto is in a bull market, but it reverses just as quickly when price starts going back down.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"that's also true, 1 per avid gamer as pointed out by another commenter so it would work out pretty well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think intel should strictly focus on capturing the us gamer market, likely at the temporary expense of not getting the global gamer market.","business reasons: devs cater largely to the us market, so if many us gamers, who spend more per capita on games, have the cards, devs will bake intel tech like xess and optimize for these gpu's.","plus they can't produce enough out of tsmc to satiate global demand, and focusing on one country will keep things on shelves and anchor the pricing low, which will eventually keep things affordable globally as well.","after that, the global market tends to follow the us market when and if production capacity rises enough to satiate global demand.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's true, but if we want the their cards to get a fair shake on launch, that's the best way i can think of right now.","then they can open it up to amazon, newegg, and best buy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

is this an f cpu?,i have a 12700kf and its an absolute nightmare to post because most boards don't have gen 3 pcie x16 set and im using a riser cable.,if you're plugged into gpu and it has all the power it needs you need to keep cycling on and off power till you post.,bios flashing is absolutely chalked but trust me it will post.,even if you ha e to sit there for 30 min shutting it off and turning it on.,once you get into bios you need to go to pch settings and change x16 to gen 3 and if using gen 3 ssd change x4 to gen 3 as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the 50mv undervolt limit is probably due to how the msi bios handles offset vcore, you set the amount and the +/- seperately.",so it's probably to stop people overvolting past +50mv and doing some serious damage.,"if you check that table, this is already undervolted a total of -210mv for all-core loads so not sure if that could be pushed much further.",i will look into xtu or some other software adjustments though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

then you can identify what ram chips they are, eg.",samsung or micron b/e die.,from that you can google around to see what timings people run them at.,"for now maybe try manually dropping the memory multiplier to 32x100mhz to get 3200mhz and try that in gear 1, since i think 3200 in gear 1 will have lower latency than 3600 gear 2.

it might be that some of the secondary timings aren't being set correctly by the msi board, so identifying the memory chips will let you check out what timings people are successfully using compared to what the bios has them set to.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

its the loudest part of the aio (i got the arctic lf 360mm and 240mm).,"does less for vrms as the oversized d15 150mm fans, they move simply more air inbetween the heatpipes and it doesnt cause audible noise with big fans.","cool gimmick, but at least you can disconnect the small noisy fan if you really want the aio for other reasons.","with cpu cooler comparisons, especially aio vs air cooler that are similar priced like the arctic lf 360mm vs noctua d15, the noise normalized tests are usually pretty far away from silent system requirements.",\>35db(a) is not silent bedroom level and it would be to noisy in a quiet office space aswell.,"this ignores the fact that air coolers, the bigger ones are able to drop very low in noise levels, while aios are much more limited with the allways present pump noise.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes.",i tried and offset and setting a core voltage.,core voltage worked better for me.,"i tried 1.25-1.35 and settled at 1.28.  i'm not familiar with what coolers are best for a sff build but whatever the best is, get that because the temps are hot.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b09lch78ql/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=utf8&psc=1

a bit worried though the fuma 2 has free shipping for prime members but no prime, hopefully it doesn't take too long to get here.",i wonder now if that one you linked would be better.,i went with the fuma 2 because it seems highly regarded.,i haven't heard of and can't find anything on that thermalright.,"also my ram sticks i ordered are white, i'm not too picky about aesthetics my pc is going to look like frankenstein on the inside.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sure, i'm running a 12600k with 4 case fans in addition to the drp4.","i am not in the habit of benchmarking so i have no idea what happens under different workloads, but if i run `stress -c 16` (run all cores at 100% for a cpu intensive task) all the p cores will sit at around 50c, some occasionally spiking a little higher, and all the e-cores sit at around 44c.","other workloads may push higher temps on single cores, as single cores with high utilization won't cause my fans to kick up (but 100% utilization of all cores puts all fans close to 100%).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah the difference is tiny.,"on noctua site, they have a cpu compatibility list(and one for motherboard, one for cases), and whenever the 15 and 12a has basically identical compatibility across the cpu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is it?,";-;

i assumed that the 12a was lighter and didn't check the specsheet",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wonder what the noise is like.,one thing that impressed me about gn video on the fuma was that even at max the thing had insanely low noise.,like under 35db.,i just hope i can boost at max with the 12700k and maybe even have a little room left over with it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no problem.,"looks like doing some memory and cpu intensive compute workloads with all threads i am getting closer to 60c on p-cores, but i can't imagine it ever getting much higher.","i don't know about 12700k, i'm sure it will run a little hotter though",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
youâ€™d think so but the benchmarks say it is.,it has more heat pipes and more fin density.,i almost got the 15d and then watched some youtube vids on it and found the u12a ran a couple degrees cooler and had good ram clearance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i only use the cpu for gaming and it only max out at like 66c for me so i wouldn't be able to tell if mine is performing better than yours or not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yea, that's why i was doing circles in my head last night.","i want to really use corsair for aio, it just floors me they don't include the set screws.","okay, cause every single (which there's like 5) place you can order the screws from, other than corsair, is either israel or china..... lol i'm in california, so hopefully they don't take weeks to get here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nope, its a heavy mofo.","denser fin stack, thats why it needs the 2000 rpm fans, and they really need to work at kinda high rpm.","the d15 can keep temps in check at like 400 rpm, cause the fin stack is way less dense, so there is more airflow at lower rpm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ah gotcha, thatâ€™s good to hear!",i was just wondering what other people with the galahad 360 are experiencing.,iâ€™ll probably test it in games more soon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"didn't even know they had been around that long, then again when i got into desktop pcs in 2009 i just used the stock cooler until i upgraded to a 6700k.","sounds good though, although i guess i'm going to be hearing my case fans and gpu fan much more now over this fuma 2 since it's so quiet.",hopefully they don't take too long on getting it shipped!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is correct.,"i have had both coolers(in the chromax variants) and tested both on my z490, x570, and z690 platforms.",d15 consistantly outperforms u12a in tests with constant variables.,"because of the 140mm fans, the d15 fans moved slower, but the sound difference was unnoticeable for me(noise tolerance is high).","both great coolers though, just depends on case and tolerances, although i fit trident z5s under the d15 and i thought those were tall.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so all of the benchmarks that have been done are wrong?,lol.,youâ€™re not confusing the 12s which is older with the 12a are you?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"check noctua website , nh d15 is better then the 12a then nh d15s !",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
kind of unfortunate i haven't heard much about thermalright then.,i know my amd 965 had a horizontal fan but i always thought that was just mostly a stock fan vs aftermarket higher quality fan thing.,cool to see where the trend started.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's a huge upgrade for sure.,that gpu shouldn't be especially bottle necked though so if you want to wait i'd wait for the raptor lake series.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ideally you upgrade both, even if it means getting a cheaper cpu, the 12700f will save you $100 with no performance loss from the 12700k, but even the 12400f at $180 will be a big upgrade from a 7700k, with twice the multithreaded performance and 35% more single thread over the 7700k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you could try cleaning the computer and reapplying theheat sink thermal paste or upgrade the cooler while you are in the there.,if you are not seeing high cpu usage you are being limited by your gpu and an upgrade would only be a nice to have.,in another year hopefully costs will down on gpu and ddr5 so you would have a good upgrade path.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, i upgraded my 7700k to a 11700k and it was a decent upgrade, so 12700k will be slightly better

hmm but a better gpu would perform better",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you had ray tracing turned on, it can cause more cpu usage.",and in task manager ray tracing usage is on a sub graph in gpu area.,"right click on the cpu graph to show all threads, because 35% is not a bottle neck",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the h100x or any 240mm aio is more than enough for the 12700k if gaming is your primary workload.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i see a lot of people going with the arctic pro 360 but i have a noctua nh u12a and get better temps than they do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

https://tpucdn.com/review/intel-core-i5-12400f/images/performance-per-dollar.png

i dont think bclk overclocking makes a 12400f a better overall *value* because you could get away with a $100 h610 and ddr4, and stock cooler and still maintain its amazing stock performance.",while you do have to spend more for a bclk oc setup.,"you certainly get more performance, but not performance per dollar.","imo the 12700f at $320 is probably the more likely candidate, people will already be looking at around $200 boards for a higher end cpu, possibly want ddr5 too, so your not really increasing your budget to do a bclk oc.","it wont make it the best performance per dollar cpu by any means, but it will increase its performance per dollar.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
isn't that high of a bclk overclocking detrimental to other devices relying on the clock like an nvme ssd?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you should run gpu-z while you overclock and watch the power draw.,gpu-z will split the power drawn by each connector.,"iirc an 8 pin can run about 150 watts, and a 6 pin can run about 75. the pcie port pulls about 75 from the mobo as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""per the molex specification, a single 8 pin can handle up to 324w of power.","however, the atx specification takes into account crappy power supplies, hence the lower limit of 150w.""",atx specs are irrelevant for psu to gpu connection as the 8 pins aren't hooking up to the motherboard like they would for the cpu plugs.,"even then though, you can exceed 300w on some boards as i have two 8 pins powering my cpu as well and i've hit 315w of cpu total package power when pushing overclocking hard.","also i'm using an evga psu, and they say their psu and 8 pin cables can safely handle a minimum of [288w per cable](https://i.imgur.com/7cnwue6.jpg) at max output.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so you would need at minimum a separate 8 pin and 6 pin.,"i'm guessing your card has 2x 8 pin connectors, and i would run them both separate from the psu.",no reason to underpower such a high end card.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the pcie port supplies an additional 75w.,that's how low power cards that don't require a power connection to the psu run.,"150w per 8 pin

the difference would be so small.,i'd wait a few generations still if i were you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd say just get an 5600x or 5800x and call it a day (until the next gpu upgrade).,there is probably only a slight bottlenecking with the 3600x currently anyway.,here's an article with ryzen scaling through the generations (3060 ti is about 10% slower than 3070.,):[https://www.techspot.com/article/2201-four-years-of-ryzen-5-gpu-scaling/](https://www.techspot.com/article/2201-four-years-of-ryzen-5-gpu-scaling/),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends what resolution you game on.,do you need a cpu upgrade?,if you don't have any issues with your current system why not wait until you do?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also doubt you need a better cpu for a 3060ti,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i guess so...

i already have a gpu: tuf gaming 3060 ti oc v2",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thanks for the link!,"so far from the article it seems that @ 1080p - 6-game average, between a ryzen **3600x** and **5600x** there is \~ **10 fps** difference (on high quality), depending on the title, with a rtx 3070, which is a little bit better than my 3060 ti.","on lower quality levels, the difference is a little bit bigger \~ **20fps**.",i thought the gap would be bigger.,but unfortunately they didn't test something like dota 2 which is mostly cpu bound?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

can you give details and examples?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there is always a bottleneck, it's either your cpu or your gpu.","the 3070 is fine, i'm just saying that with a 12700k the 3070 will be the limiting factor.","meaning, your cpu can get 200 fps in x game but the 3070 can only do 150, therefore you will be getting 150.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"at that time yeah 8600k was decent gaming chip, but 9600k was terrible (too little, too late) especially when you could get r5 3600 at that time and in general it aged like a milk.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
many games got smoother.,"for example cyberpunk, a large npc amount sometimes was able to overcome gpu bottleneck, especially while driving.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
aged like milk seems a bit excessive.,"6c6t is still perfectly usable, and definitely [better than the 3600](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k6mwezzm_c).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
though we are talking about 5.1ghz oc with 360mm aio and still bouncing 70-85c in gaming workloads.,thats a bit of a stretch here since its clearly not fully stable.,"4.8ghz would be more realistic use case, but yeah even then it trades blows and sometimes outperforms r5 3600.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 3600 is oced as well.,"not sure under what basis you claim it isn't fully stable, but even at 5ghz it still handily outperforms the 3600, unless you happen to have a better source?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

now if you run both at stock, well...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

vliw - very large investment wasted.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a little context - hp was already spending millions on another architecture prior to itanium - pa-risc - which was clearly on the way out.,since they had previously canned the dec alpha architecture (which seemed like a bad move at the time imo) they switched investing to itanium to sell their servers* as x86 didn't have the high end features at the time demanded by the market.,obviously hp kept throwing money at an architecture that wasn't getting noticeable better while x86 just kept steamrolling along.,*it wasn't super clear at the time that x86 could scale up that much though it turned out.. yes it could.,1995's pentium pro brought x86 integer performance in line with higher end arches though floating point was relatively weak.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"itanium was going to replace intel's x86, because everyone knew that 32 bit-only could only address 4gb of ram, and mainstream systems were rapidly getting to that point.","the problem, simply, was itanium was a really different architecture and intel wrote crappy compilers.","windows wasn't a problem because nt was designed to be processor-independent from the very beginning, so ms was able to create an itanium version easily.",but intel's compilers meant that a lot of ported x86 code ran poorly.,"to run well, it had to be rewritten for itanium.",and then amd swept in and created its x86/x64 hybrid.,"amd x64 isn't a pure 64-bit chip, but it still offered 64-bit computing and it meant all your existing 32-bit software still ran perfectly.",no need to rewrite all that code at all.,and then the market spoke.,intel and hp had planned on selling itanium first to the enterprise and then eventually get consumer versions.,"but amd was like, ""no, we're selling to everyone"" and athlon 64 sales blew up.",eventually it got to the point that intel saw the writing on the wall and made a deal to license amd 64 and produce its own x86/64 hybrids.,"and itanium lost the war, though it would chug on for over a decade in enterprise servers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"besides the market reasons, there were some technical problems.",itanium was what is called vliw architecture.,that's sort of the polar opposite of risc architecture.,the point of vliw is that the compiler packages the code in very long and complex instruction words containing multiple operations that can be executed simultaneously (as opposed to modern risc idea of short and simple instructions that the cpu itself reorders for simultaneous execution).,this way the processor itself can be a simpler in-order design that just decodes and executes the instructions.,theoretically this would be good because one large part of what a modern cpu does (buffering and reordering operations) can be dropped resulting in good efficiency.,however it turned out that writing a compiler that can do this compile time instruction ordering well is extremely difficult.,and often it worked well only when the code was specifically written for itanium.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think it's because itanium required a whole new instruction set.,"( kinda like how arm and x86 are different instruction sets)

and it probably would have worked out if amd hadn't made x64 which was backwards compatible with x86, and therefore didn't require people to totally rewrite programs for the new architecture",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a combo of reasons but basically it was an ambitious new design for how cpus work that didn't pan out.,the cpu was capable of very high throughput but required god-like compilers that never materialized.,"later (and finally) x86 ""grew up"" a lot with 64bit support (amd first) and thanks to economies of scale of x86, momentum shifted killing itanium.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"performance sucked, first and foremost.",efficiency wasn't anything to write home about and it couldn't run x86 software without a rewrite/recompilation due to its instruction set (ia-64).,"basically, doa out of the gate",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"itanium was a massive success: they managed to convince hp, compaq and sgi to kill off pa-risc, alpha axp and mips on workstations.","sure, it never quite achieved anything resembling adoption but it moved the competition to x86, also an intel platform.",(until that pesky opteron moved onto the scene),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i live in washington; we once had an intel r&d facility in dupont that was specifically dedicated to the itanium architecture.,"it closed down more than 5 years ago, and was torn down to make way for yet another distribution centre in the town that already has dozens of them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
alpha had been already canned long before hp bought compaq.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"theoretically, yes.",the raw performance was there.,"but itanium went full retard in â€œmoving the complexity out of hardware and into the compilerâ€ and in order to write software that would actually take advantage of its parallelism, the compiler would need to know exactly what to do, which would take a lot of brainpower and money that no one was willing to invest in.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they've been readily available for years now.,they're fairly useless from a performance perspective now.,"outside of the novelty of them, i don't see the point in buying a system with it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itanium was originally developed at hp as a replacement to pa-risc and then it became a joint venture with intel as they were looking for a 64-bit processor solution.,they initially expected massive sales but actual figures were nowhere near as close as they hoped.,"then amd introduced x64 with full backwards compatibility with x86 programs and, go figure, an easier experience writing software for the new chip compared to the explicitly-parallel nightmare that was itanium, and the dominoes fell from there.","as for why hp didnâ€™t give up a decade before they did, i donâ€™t know.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i don't know why, but it seemed like itanium was also extremely hard to design on the engineering side, too.","i was a brand-spanking-new mask designer in 1997, and started work on 250nm merced, but it look so long that they scrapped all that layout and restarted on the next generation 180nm process.","maybe that was just the first itanium version though, and the rest went better?","i don't know, as i moved on to pentium iiis and 4s after that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> intel wrote crappy compilers.,"> i wonâ€™t be surprised at all if the whole multithreading idea turns out to be a flop, **worse than the ""itanium"" approach that was supposed to be so terrificâ€”until it turned out that the wished-for compilers were basically impossible to write.","**

\- [knuth on itanium](https://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1193856)

it wasn't just intel, a lot of folks have been struggling to extract that level of parallelism at compile-time for a fairly long time.","if someone waved a magic wand and ""solved"" that problem we'd probably be building things that looked more like itanium or, frankly, gpus after we got over the _far more important_ implications.",as an aside the preamble might sound a little tone-deaf out of context but i think his overall point is still valid 14 years later.,"even though a modern pc is typically doing many things at once, some of which the users actually want it to be doing, there are still a lot of workloads that are very resistant to parallelization.",even workloads that aren't frequently bump into the diminishing returns described by [amdahl's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amdahl%27s_law) extremely quickly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> amd x64 isn't a pure 64-bit chip, but it still offered 64-bit computing and it meant all your existing 32-bit software still ran perfectly

amd64 was a pure 64-bit chip with a 100% ia-32 compatible mode.","earlier examples used to boot up in virtual 8086 mode and entered long mode (or not, probably plenty of athlon 64 machines on xp which only ran in i386 mode) during the os boot process until uefi became widespread.",just like how the 80386 was a 100% 32-bit chip with 100% 8086 compatibility.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itanium was never positioned as a replacement for desktop processors.,it was always going to be the next powerful server processor.,"when amd released their 64-bit extensions for their desktop processor that was backwards compatible with existing software, that was probably the death knell for itanium.",source: i worked at intel during these times.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it is interesting that vliw ended up being the underlying architecture of a lot of gpus of the 2000s, so it is not completely far-fetched for someone in the late 90s to look at it as a way forward.","in retrospect though vliw ended up mostly being phased out of even gpus by the last decade, and today is used only in low power dsp cores and the like.",so it was clearly not the way forward for a general purpose or even server processor.,"even in the early 2000s it was very unclear how vliw was supposed to work for heavy integer workloads, which with the rise of the internet where an increasingly huge fraction of the server market.","best case by 2005 itanium was something like the xeon phi, an interesting product with a few uses.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

sort of, but not really and not even all risc did that.","arm didn't do instructions that did one thing, and arm was the most successful of all the old risc.",the bigger idea of risc was that you had instructions that were efficient to implement.,"usually that meant doing as little per instruction as possible, but not always.","vliw is one way to do that, since you're usually packaging groups of risc-like instructions together.","the groups of instructions do different things at once, but they're individually usually easy to implement like risc.","plus since the superscalar execution is encoded in the instruction, it's usually very easy to decide and issue.",>the leading idea of vliw is that instructions do a lot of things.,"it's not that they do lots of things, it's that you package multiple instructions together at compilation rather than forcing the processor to figure out how to issue them at runtime.","in some of the simpler vliw (like intel i960), you literally have two risc pipelines bolted together, and the compiler tells which pipeline to issue each cycle.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">arm didn't do instructions that did one thing,

well there are exceptions but most of arm follows that rule.",however the point there is not that risc isn't like that but that arm doesn't follow risc principles.,>the bigger idea of risc was that you had instructions that were efficient to implement.,i'm pretty sure every instruction set tries to achieve this.,">it's not that they do lots of things, it's that you package multiple instructions together

the end result is that one instruction word ends up doing a lot of things, unlike in risc.",this has all kinds of implications for e.g.,code density.,hardware implementation is in my opinion a separate question.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>well there are exceptions but most of arm follows that rule.,however the point there is not that risc isn't like that but that arm doesn't follow risc principles.,in classic arm all alu instructions are conditional and so can act like branches.,"memory instructions can increment pointers (and so act like alu instructions), and there are compound load/store operations that can microcode together dozens of operations into a single instruction.",if arm mostly follows that rule then x86 is a pure risc isa in comparison.,in my opinion that makes it a pretty bad rule.,>i'm pretty sure every instruction set tries to achieve this.,classic cisc does not.,"instructions were meant to be expressive and efficient to use, not necessarily efficient to implement.",this is actually the essential idea of risc that sets it apart from cisc.,"it isn't that instructions should be simple but rather they should be simple to implement, even if they do complicated things (see arm).",in contrast cisc isas did not necessarily work like this because implementation complexity was often seen as a worthwhile price to pay for more powerful instructions.,"thinking about this more, here is a really great example of how risc was about being efficient to implement rather than just logically simple.","the classic risc isas (mips, arm, ppc, etc) had fused multiply add instructions, which do two things (multiplication and addition) in a single instruction.",it is literally a single instruction that replaces two separate instructions.,many of them also lacked division instructions or added them only grudgingly even though division is a single logical thing.,doing two things at once was fine for risc as long as those two things were efficient.,doing one thing at a time wasn't fine if it was inefficient to implement.,">the end result is that one instruction word ends up doing a lot of things, unlike in risc.","and just like arm, the most successful risc isa.","or like the multiplication-add instructions in mips, arm, ppc, ...

hmmm why mess with that?,"we are moving to voltage input, not wattage.",each core requires 15w max.,so 16 cores would need 240w for optimal performance or you are damaging your components.,stop overclocking.,leave the turbo settings as is.,new computers come with a control center and intel xtu service.,leave it as is.,youâ€™d need some incredible cooling for 240w of power.,nothing short of 3m novak.,increase the turbo time not the power limits.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2) anandtech [estimated](https://www.anandtech.com/show/17047/the-intel-12th-gen-core-i912900k-review-hybrid-performance-brings-hybrid-complexity/4)about 50w off a single core at its turbo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nobody said anything about voltage or overclocking.,the data i shared was completely stock behavior on a gigabyte z690i,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well... certain mobos have different power limits as a stock.,i had default/stock bios 160w pl1 and 190w pl2 then i updated bios to newest and it was 150w for both pl1 and pl2 limit.. so sometimes you have to change those manually.. you could go for default intel specs aka 125w pl1 and 190w pl2 or you could do 150w pl1 and 190w pl2 or even more if your cpu cooler is up to the task...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my asus also came with pl2=pl1 set to unlimited.,they just expect you to reduce pl1 to what your cooler can handle.,it's the new easy way to maximize performance without messing with voltages.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
really?,i can easily cool a 12900k @ 240watts with a u12a.,that's a single tower small air cooler lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
temp has an exponential impact on leakage power.,"at higher voltages vf curves become worse at higher temperature (noise margins, voltage margins and we will be wire limited), you may need to run at higher voltages to hit same freq.",increasing dynamic power too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> is the wattage 

more wattage is not increase your cpu (package core) temp.","watch this compare [4:38](https://youtu.be/sgv2m5fz06i?t=278)

your temp is decided by cpu vcore, higher vcore your mb can stand, higher frequent efficiency u can get

i think your mb locked cpu run at 175w.","when you use air cooler, more energy waste to heat and when u run on aio, it reach its limit and not increase anymore.",you should find sth in bios like max performance/max turbo/multithread and enable it and retest.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what i said was for pre-i7-8700 cpuâ€™s.,modern cpuâ€™s use a very different design.,those are not logic gates with voltage dividers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
set 150w for both and call it a day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
idk what you're spouting.,"not only is this whole thread about alder lake, but there's no special cutoff from 8700k forwards - 6700 and 8700 are basically on the same process node, and people have even run the 8700k on boards meant for 6700k, with a few pin mods.","cpus in ""chip"" form have always used transistors.","transistors are arranged into logic gates - and, or, exclusive or, not.","those are basic thinking blocks responsible for *every* calculation and decision in a binary computer, whether it has two thousand or fifteen billion transistors.",transistors additionally can store charge and act as memory if they remain powered to refresh each other.,pl1 and pl2 are package wattage limiters on some recent intel cpus.,"amd has the same thing, just by different names.",a wattage limiter affects how high on the voltage-frequency curve a processor can go.,"frequency affects performance; therefore, wattage constraints affect performance, just not linearly.","and i happen to have no issue cooling 240w on my 12900k with a strong air cooler, the d15.","some of it is luck getting a good mount, then of course not impeding airflow or drawing hot air into the heatsink.",doing that i can cool about 260w at room temperature (25c).,people using water have cooled >300w.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"37c idle temp is ok - check your motherboard settings, some motherboards have a 'silent' mode that turns the cpu fan off if the temp is below a certain value (e.g.",50c).,does the fan come on consistently if your cpu temp rises above 50c?,i would also plug the fan directly into your motherboards cpu fan socket.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"your hub probably has 1 fan that is controlling the speeds of all the other ones depending on the configuration of the curve, if that's a case fan, it also affects the cooler you've connected to the hub.","you should connect your noctua fans directly to the cpu opt or, cpu fan header on your motherboard for it to work independently from the hub fans and according to the cpu temps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if that were the case, wouldn't all the case fans plugged into the hub shut off when under xâ° because the hub is plugged into the cpu fan header?",it got up to 57â° and still didn't turn on so i'm not sure about that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would have the cooler plugged into that port except my fan hub is in it.,that's what phanteks told me to do because of the pwm controls i think.,"either way i have the hub set to cpu temp so when it gets hotter, all the fans should speed up.","and they do when under a little load, but the cpu cooler fan stays still.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
plug only the cpu fan into the cpu fan header and see if you can manually set the cpu fan header speed yourself.,"maybe there is something going wrong with the detection, but it is weird because you say you can see you cpu temp.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"okay update, i plugged the cooler into the cpu header and the hub into a different header and now everything works and is controllable by pwm.",thanks for the help.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"great, glad that worked!","i also use fan hubs (i have 7x120mm case fans), but the cpu fan is the only one plugged into that header.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah that definitely seems like the best/proper way to do it.,thanks again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

97% of asic mining machines never find a bitcoin.,they'll spend their entire lives burning electricity but never accomplish anything useful.,then they will be tossed in the trash because an old bitcoin miner is worse than worthless.,https://mobile.twitter.com/digieconomist/status/1438896477590409227,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's interesting that they aren't going to limit the gpu mining stuff.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's gonna hurt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"crypto isnt popular in general, but bitcoin isnt the issue.","nobody mines bitcoin with gpus, its all asics these days.",its etherium and some other cryptos that are purposely asic resistant and thus people gpu mine on them.,"i dont like crypto (and hate nft), but the only issue with bitcoin these days is wasted energy.","but you can argue that more efficient asics, like this one from intel is actually better for the world than not having it, because people are going to mine bitcoin on asics regardless, so might as well be more efficient.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is useless info cause nearly all machines are part of a pool and earn fractional coins right?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so we are quoting tweet as a dogma.,just read the replies.,"&#x200b;

that said from intel perspective its positive to its top line(and hopefully bottom line as well).",plus there is a huge backlog of orders to get the asics and so another supplier would ease things and prices will also go down(currently they are at ridiculous levels).,"&#x200b;

question is where are these made.",intel 14nm?,tsmc?,"i am not sure they have ""intel 7"" capacity to make these.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so you're saying i just need to buy a hundred to get 3 bitcoin?,awesome!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
efficient miners donâ€™t make cryptos more efficient.,the point of mining is to mandate energy waste.,less energy wasted means less security.,and in practice more efficient miner means you can deploy more of them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
could you argue that?,the only reason a money printer will ever be decommissioned is if the money printer prints less money than the cost of electricity.,miners have the capital to keep buying and using money printers and have no reason to stop doing so outside speculation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it's really hard to predict how well your cpu will age in gaming, and it really depends on what you consider ""good enough"" and the types of games you play.","that being said, if 100fps is ""good enough"" for you it will likely be ok for the next 3 years - maybe longer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the other replies donâ€™t seem to be very helpful-11700k is plenty powerful and will be more than enough for the average user for basically everything over the next 2 to 3 years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
