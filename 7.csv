i wonder if any tweaks were made to the new gen cpus to make them easier to cool.,seeing the 13700k swinging in the same league as the 12900k makes me nervous that it might be another rough batch for powerful itx builds.,i'm completely writing off the 13900k for sff builds unless they did some literal thermodynamic sorcery.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
substantially overpriced msrp smh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
isn't the i9 13900k supposed to be $589?,what the crap is this pricing (talking about neweggs bloated $659) and should i hold out for other retailers?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8p 16e.,feels like a waste.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pre-ordered.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm on a 5800x3d currently and it's great, but i would like a bit more multicore performance.",thinking about switching to intel and going all out on a 13900k...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i hope thats just a preorder price.... jesus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bought 13900k at microcenter this morning for $569.,i feel bad for anyone that doesn't have a microcenter nearby.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yup, same here.",coming from an 8th gen iâ€™m super pumped.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
def going to sell my 12900k and get the 13900k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"same for me

time to retire the 5820k",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30 bucks of difference compared to 7600x for the 13600k make it a better deal for sure given the huge mt i expect,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that should translate to like 200 million euro.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wrong link for second link,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
prices only look reasonable because amd am5 prices are even more wack.,building pcs with newer stuff sucks right now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"those will be the cpu's for gamers until 70003d hits, even then amd might end up charging too much for those.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
finally took 'em down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
even 40$ above msrp - but still 100$ cheaper than 7900x.,crazy value.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and ddr5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's a great selling point for me.,"i'll be on am4 for a while, but i'm eyeing what my new platform could be.",i'm not really ready to leave ddr4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
will it only work with ddr4 3200?,im currently on ddr4 3000 and super confused about this.,gonna be upgrading my 8700k to the 13900k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, i'll spring for that (depending on australia tax)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is.,you can already preorder on newegg.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just wait till the prices for the mobo for 13th gen drops.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
spoiler: it will,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if the 13400 sits at around 200-220 it should be the usual price range for intel everywhere.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
those numbers + vat and u get your prices.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
400â‚¬ i5 lets gooo!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ngl, just woke up and read this as:

â€œi hope here in eu it *will be* much higherâ€

and i was like wtf but at the same time yeah brother it will!",ha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
euro is weak so prepare for spicy prices.,will basically be 800â‚¬ and that's if retailers don't fuck us over.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it certainly will.,a 13600 non-k might be around 300-350$,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you pay attention to exchange rates (pound,euro,yen vs dollar) you have your answer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes intel event starts in 30 minutes.,i assume they will be back after that for preorders.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or maybe to raise the price just a liiiiitlleee,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why get one?,raptor offers better performance/$ than 12th gen. 12th gen would have to come down quite a bit to be the cheaper option.,"for context, the 13600k will most likely match the 12900k in gaming.",and be just a bit slower in mt.,the 13700k will be better than the 12900k overall.,do you really think the 12900k will drop enough to be worth buying under those conditions?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">700â‚¬

probably 759 at best with current exchange rate.","that would still have intel selling it below us pricing, when eu vat is considered at current exchange rates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
secured my 2 x 13700k.,"my typical  ""go for the most expensive"" spending routine was reigned in this time lol.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the heads up!,"i was sweating this preorder, didnâ€™t think iâ€™d be able to secure one but your comment got me locked in on a 13900k!!!","wallet is going to hate me, but thatâ€™s next monthâ€™s problem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"real talk, i have a 10900k that works great but i'm thinking about upgrading.",there are two things holding me back.,it's hard for me to buy into a new socket while knowing a socket change is coming next year.,the second thing holding me back is i don't know how much or if they've improved since the 10th gen because i know 11th gen got worse performance in games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and you know this...how?,all leaks so far point to both processors trading blows in different games and applications.,"and it seems, based on this price leak, that rpl with its better mt performance in the low end will cost more than the amd counterpart.",wait for all reviews to come out before making an asinine claim like that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i agree, the 5800x3d makes zen4 and raptor lake look like a fucking joke",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not really.,z790 being a dead socket is a big deal.,hopefully get 3 generations of zen on am5.,"could get a 7600x as a place holder until 7900x3d comes out, then upgrade to 9900x3d in several years when that comes out.",iâ€™d be buying a 13600k for sure if intel didnâ€™t switch sockets every 2 gens.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"people are speculating raptor lake is going to officially be announced today or tomorrow, so if that's turns out to be the case intel wouldn't need newegg to remind everyone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
orrrrrr raptor lake is being announced in about 30 minutes haha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""everything that doesn't benefit amd is a massive conspiracy against amd""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""soon""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well i just ordered mine from newegg for $659.99 so that theory is shot to shit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is how i figure it.,i opted to pre-order on ne.,"they don't charge until it ships, and have a price guarantee.","if i am able to find it at msrp prior to the release date elsewhere, i'll buy it there and cancel at ne.","no harm, no foul.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's what i am thinking at this point.,"i doubt these things will b sold out for months, and there is no way i am going to pay $60-70 more than msrp just to preorder the thing.",$10 or $20 more in order to know that i will have one ready for launch?,sure.,$60?,no way man.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
was there a line?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you're super pumped, i'm hyper pumped coming from 2nd gen to 13th gen ;)

i started the process of building a new pc in 11 years a few weeks ago.","got a new case, psu and graphics card.",i'm a bit cpu bottlenecked at the moment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you gonna get it over the 12th gen?,i also have an 8th gen and will be getting a 3080 12 gb.,still confused if 13700k or 12700k are the way to go.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"8700k here, im going for that 13700k for sure",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"im coming from 8th gen as well, havent seen the price lineup yet but 13700k seems good based off of what im hearing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol.. that is not worth it at all.,there is not a big enough difference to justify that unless you are maybe getting almost all of your money back for the 12900k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"300+ for a 6 core in 2023, i don't know what amd is looking for",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea the euro is getting slaughtered.,everything straight up 20-30% more expensive now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks, fixed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why are those over the i9 for gaming?,just curious.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if the performance improvements they allege are true and with meteor lake delayed until late 2023, they charge 20-30% more and get away with it.",30% more gaming performance for the 7950x3d vs the 7950x is so huge i doubt even mtl will have anything to answer it with.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well the leak is over until intel has their presentation in about 1.5hrs i would expect.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"since z790 is as dead as am4, you could just as well go for 5800x3d and not switch any other component.","or, wait for meteor lake.","or go rpl, what do i know.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wouldn't know.,it's not exactly available just yet....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
xd,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 13400 will be a rebranded alder lake,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thats right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
:-d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
800 is but number for cpu :-d but after good gpu i want for first time have high end cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i hope here in eu it wont be so much higher,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™m honestly not too clued up on much of this stuff lol, i air cool my pc currently, wouldnâ€™t the newer generation run hotter than the 1200k?",if you could offer any more info that would be appreciated!,"iâ€™m currently starting to rebuild my pc and iâ€™ve got most parts bar the cpu, mobo and ram.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice!,congrats!,may the silicon gods be in your favor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a 10900k.,why the heck would we need an upgrade anytime soon?,this thing still impresses me till this day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i am just curious, if you buy a high end cpu, why would you care for how long am5 or whatever intel have?",would it make much sense to upgrade cpu every year or second?,"i ordered my 13900k today, and i come from the 4790k, and i plan on at least keeping it for like 5 years unless there is something revolutionary (trying to be realistic)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nothing wrong with that.,i was gunning for the 7700x in eco mode as well but i'm waiting for benchmarks because the 13600k is still on my radar.,"also unless you need a chip asap, it's best to wait until zen4's 3d models come out early next year because that's going to bring the price down of zen4/13th gen drastically, also ddr5 should be cheaper, as well as more mobo availability.","for me price and efficiency is most important, so whatever chip is best bang for the buck while running cooler/consuming less power in their eco modes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you only care about pc gaming yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why wonâ€™t you wait 6 months when the early adopter issues are fixed and pricing comes back down to earth where it belongs?,why buy twice and thrice of the cpu generation?,i prefer a car in that case.,i tend to upgrade infrequently and this point is moot for me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm not able to get through check out on my 13900k, it just keeps looping to the previous screen in the checkout process ðÿ˜”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i pre-ordered anyways because honestly don't know how the market will respond.,i can always cancel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tell me about it.. i preordered immediately on bh when they first allowed and i got notification that it was backordered so god knows when i'll get it.,i presume it will be sometime in mid-november before next shipments.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very small.,maybe 10 people.,i got there an hour before open and i was first.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice!,im going from 3rd gen to 13th.,"i understand the feeling of needing to replace everything, can't reuse anything except the gpu and even then i'll probably have to replace that one too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how is your 2600k.,mine was running 4.4ghz on all core.,first generation where i think about upgrading.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"maaan, you an og with your 2600k.","i had 2600 non-k in my job back in 2013, it was a corporate upgrade from old systems, all across the 4000 employee building.",that machine was flying compared to what we had before.,it's such a solid chip,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13700k for me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'd say go with 13700k, it's more refined in the sense that you are coming from 8th gen. i'll be going the same path although i am upgrading from 9700k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
absolutely.,going all in on rl and ddr5.,iâ€™m also on a 1080 so iâ€™m way overdue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
:d hehe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
369 euros to be exact,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's ridiculous, when euro was still like 1,40 to 1, we still would get the idiotic 1:1 conversion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not fixed.,still points to the 13600k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"because the 13600k is half the price of a 13900k while offering 95% of the performance for gaming, tune the 13600k and it'll be on par with a 13900k for gaming.",13600k with a 3080 is better than a 13900k with a 3060ti.,if you've got all the money in the world then a 4090 and 13900k would be the way to go.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
price/performance ratio,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the i5 and i7 give you 96% and 98% of the performance for substantially less.,"if all you do is gaming, its hard to justify going above an i5

https://www.techpowerup.com/review/intel-core-i9-12900k-alder-lake-12th-gen/16.html",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're right.,intel platforms are way to short lived.,"i've just upgraded to a 5600 from a 3600, having an i5-3570k before those.","so i guess i'll catch whatever comes late at the end of am5 (9 or 11000, who knows).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just watched hardware canucks' [video](https://youtu.be/pxouydz5wm4?t=350) regarding 13th gen raptor lake and tldr meteor lake will be on a new motherboard socket... yes... another socket... so 13th gen is also a dead end.... lol....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
800 to 850 euros for 13900k.,but better question is mobo pricing.,just look at am5 mobo prices like wtf.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> wouldnâ€™t the newer generation run hotter than the 1200k?,"""hotter"" as they say, ""that depends"".",what do you mean by that?,temperature?,total wattage?,"a 50w can run ""hotter"" due to high heat density/thermal resistance in the cooling setup (like using paste vs soldered ihs) than a 500w cpu.",but if we are talking total power.,intel will most likely push power with rpl.,"but if a 13700k will end up pulling as much as a 12900k is doubtful for example, despite performing better.",since it will sit at a more optimal point of the v/f curve than the ald chip.,still depends on what power limits you as a user set though.,if you set the same power limits for the 13700k as the 12900k and isn't thermally constrained.,"then ye, it will use that power.","the one thing you can really say is, that the 13700k will need less power to match the performance of the 12900k.",now the 13900k is another matter.,intel will most likely crank power to the max.,"so it will pull more power than a 12900k even at ""stock"" by the indications that we have.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i changed my mind.,i play at 4k and the difference between the 10900k amd 12900k is 1-2 fps at 4k.,it's much more about the gpu so i have no meed to upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"with how good the 5800x3d is, the 8900x3d and 9900x3d should be phenomenal and would be nice to be able to upgrade to those without buying a new mobo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
might want to check out the 5800x3d unless you're going to make use of the e cores on the 13600k.,"both chips are in dead end sockets, but the x3d sips power and has cheaper boards, cooling, and memory.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because i sold my entire system before the announcements before it got harder to sell.,should still be able to recoup a good chunk of cost selling the 7600x to upgrade to the 7900x3d.,will also feel like less money as iâ€™ll already have the mobo and ddr5.,made probably an extra couple hundred by selling early.,the extra money will cover the 7600x placeholder loss and then some.,i also didnâ€™t get in on am4 until zen 3. want to get in early as possible this time to maximize the amount of upgrades i can do.,"i donâ€™t mind paying essentially ~$8 a month ($200 every two years, enough to cover the difference after selling old cpu when you donâ€™t have to buy a new mobo) to consistently upgrade to the newest generation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i suppose that's valid.,"i guess i'm a little hesitant to preorder, and i don't want to encourage newegg that i'm okay with that pricing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how many did they have?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah i had a 1080 ti since 2017.  when the evga 3080 ti ftw dropped to $800 a few weeks ago, i couldn't resist.","it wouldn't fit in my old case, so decided to start my build a little early.",i was surprised that such a new card works fine with an 11 year old motherboard and cpu with no workarounds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm going from 3rd to 13th too!,very excited to see how things run after a 10 year jump.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it was running 4.2 ghz up till last year.,then i started getting a bunch of blue screens even after fresh win 10 install.,so i went back to stock settings hoping that it wouldn't die before i was ready to upgrade.,almost there just need another couple months.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've actually got a 12700k sitting its sealed box on my desk looking at me right now.,i'm in the process of upgrading from a 9700k and was set to do the build on sunday but the motherboard arrived with a puncture through the retail box and i didn't trust it.,i exchanged and the new one arrives this week.,blessing in disguise!,i preordered the 13700k today and will be returning the 12th gen this afternoon.,the timing is great!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"nah, that was from the taxes.","when the 3090 launched at 1500 usd it was also 1500 euro, which may seem like 1:1 but it's not.",the 20% vat tax offsets the increased value that the euro had.,"now that the euro is truly at 1:1, the prices are even higher in euro.",for example the 4090 launched at 1600 usd yet in euro the price is now 2000 - significantly higher than the 1600 euro that it would have been had the exchange rates not been wrecked.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"these are power limits, intended to limit the power draw, performance, and heat output of the cpu.",they do not represent what the cpu â€œcouldâ€ or â€œwill routinelyâ€use.,"for a somewhat more â€œaccurateâ€ estimate of what the cpu might use while under heavy load, look to the maximum â€œturboâ€ power, which is 180w for the 12700 and 190w for the 12700k.","now, hereâ€™s the thing.",even those high numbers are artificial limits.,certain workloads might want to use more than that.,and this is why those seeking performance remove the power limits and let the cpu draw what it wants for any given workload.,but donâ€™t freak out.,"itâ€™s not going to always draw 190 watts, or 125 watts, or 65 watts.",it draws what it needs depending on the current load.,"my stock 12900k can draw 260+ watts running a stress test in prime95, but when itâ€™s idling on the desktop, itâ€™ll use less than 10 watts.",this is true for all workloads.,the only time the cpu will actually sit at 65 watts or 125 watts is when it wants to use more but is being forced to use less (and is thus giving less performance than it could).,"now the deal with those two processors: if you are running a long, intense workload like rendering a video, due to the 12700â€™s very low long term power limit of 65 watts, it will perform much slower than the 12700k thatâ€™s allowed to use 125 watts.","but both of those limits are completely artificial, or â€œsuggestedâ€.",they are not locked.,you can remove them or set them to whatever you want.,so the 12700 can be nearly as fast as a stock 12700k.,"in a desktop case with a good cooling solution, there is (in my opinion) no reason to leave the power limits on any alder lake cpu.","the main reason would be if you have a small case with limited thermal capacity, or a crappy motherboard vrm.",and of course laptops need power limits too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

they're consistent to an extent.,"in the bios, if the cpu is set to its stock configurations then yes, typical power consumption will be 125w for the k version.","it'll boost up temporarily for 56 seconds during a phase called tau and reach 190w but when that time expires, it'll drop back down to 125w for the remainder of whatever load it's being used for.",the stock configurations for the non k version will use 65w average and will use up to 180w during its tau period before dropping back down to 65w.,the problem is virtually every motherboard manufacturer allows intels non k parts to use unlimited power by default.,"they do this to advertise their boards as being ""the best"" for your cpu because they want to sell it to you, obviously.","unless you look into the bios yourself, non k cpus will be using unlimited power almost always.",you can switch it to stock configurations in the bios though.,just be aware that this will limit the cpus performance significantly in pretty much everything that's not gaming.,the performance will still be good but tests show a 12700 locked to its stock configurations is about equal to an 11700k.,not bad.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"they knew it and they designed the new generation accordingly, now it's a matter of adobe supporting hardware codecs for nvidia and amd gpus as well as they support quicksync on intel's igpus.","[apparently right now there are driver issues or software issues](https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/adobe-premiere-pro-amd-ryzen-7000-series-vs-intel-core-12th-gen-2360/) where premiere pro can't use the amd integrated hardware encoder/decoder for h264, h265, which means that in those tests puget had to resort to pure software.","when using codecs different from h264/h265 the story changes, since intel looses the quicksync advantage and has to brute force it.",so if you use codecs like prores or red you might still want an amd cpu.,"there are tests for each codec, so you can better choose.","also, if you buy an intel ""f"" cpu, you'll get much much worse results for h264/h265 tests as well, as those cpus don't have an igp, and therefore no quicksync.",gotta check your workflow and act accordingly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is not a good take.,itâ€™s the software that needs to work with the hardware not the other way around,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is unfair to amd these are brand new products that aren't fully on the market.,it is quite likely there will be a new version of the software shortly that does support their igpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
another bad take,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is a bad take considering this is the first time a productivity cpu includes a media encoding engine on the amd side.,"also, if you change codecs to other productivity-minded ones, the quick sync advantage evaporates.",also consider that premiere has shit nvenc support too and nvidia isn't bad at software support.,"regardless, you can still get that performance benefit if you have an nvidia gpu on your system, which, why wouldn't you if you're doing media productivity stuff.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's stupid.,instead of working right away with the right codec you are willing to wait around until all you content has been transcoded to then be able to work?,and transcoded to a lossy format?,"you'd be throwing away a lot of quality, might as well get the best tool for the job.","if you are not recording straight to h264 or h265, and you are either recording in prores (maybe using an iphone, not unheard of in low budget professional environments nowadays) or in some raw format like red, then you should not transcode the footage, work on it and then encode it again.",the quality of the end result will be garbage and you will have lost lots of information that you could have otherwise used to make it better.,there's a reason why these other formats exist.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

completely agree.","any benchmark including those favoring amd are typically a combination of different tests, not everyone uses all components equally hence as you say, testing your workflow is key.","on ""premiere pro can't use the amd integrated hardware encoder/decoder"" what is your guess?",amd tested their new cpu with adobe premiere and launched it without any warning to premiere users?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"""software development"" and ""adobe"" is a contradiction.",if the people at adobe would actually develop decent software then amd would be on top of the charts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my understanding is that quicksync is intels version of h264 acceleration.,"amd actually supports h264 acceleration on its apus (and they also support offloading it onto their gpus, nvidea does the same).","the issue isn't that adobe can't support this acceleration on amd (or nvidea) hardware, it's that they choose not to.","this isn't an amd software issue, it's an adobe software issue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

but remember.,apple was using amd gpus since 2015 in the macbook pros and mac pros.,"easy, show me an intel laptop that scores higher than a macbook pro 16 m1 max in premier puget benchmark that is under 5 lbsâ€¦ and not to add to the claim but never mind apple sells its own video editing software and still worked to make premiere smoother for everyone.",what is amd excuse now ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
really?,you think apple makes its billions from laptops ?,"apple money is from iphones, ipads and apps revenue not from laptops.",yet the â€œwe donâ€™t have moneyâ€ is an argument that stopped working since ryzen 3000s.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
never lagging?,really ?,we forget recent history quite fast.,see 1:40 or so here https://youtu.be/dx8j125s4cg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what do amd gpus have to do with cpus?,and why are you talking about laptops now?,can't you stay on topic?,amd doesn't have the budget of the biggest tech company in the world and they didn't drop a new architecture where most software only works trough an interpretation layer.,the adobe suit is pretty much number 1 on apple devices when it comes to content creation.,if apple wouldn't have fed them (and others) money it would've surely performed like shit which would've ended in the m-series being dead on arrival,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what are you even talking about?,apples net worth is 20 times higher than amds.,"their profit margin is much higher aswell, so they have a lot more money they can spend",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"lagging, yes.","**lagging behind**, no.",apples intel laptops performed as they were designed by apple themselves.,"they ran like they should, simple as that",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
apple has its own video editing software.,apple having more money is no excuse for amd not to try.,even more amd knew of the frustration of premiere users in all those years they supplied crappy gpus to apple laptops (hence why i mentioned laptops),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that can be, but the money is not in laptops.","if they were just for the money, they would be developing apps or ipads.","a quiz for you, how much larger is the installed base of amd desktops+laptops than that of apple ?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is exactly my point.,"apple deliberately changed the design and in doing so, my claim, they worked with software developers.",amd just released yet another designs of cpus and people above this thread were arguing there is no room to consider developers when launching or designed cpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
post a screenshot of the fivr window so i can see your undervolt settings.,do not undervolt the intel gpu.,only undervolt the core and the cache.,the 11400f does not have an intel gpu so trying to change this setting might be causing the stability problem that you are having.,check the fivr monitoring table to confirm that your offset undervolt is being applied.,most intel cpus can be undervolted at least -50 mv so it sounds like something is wrong with your settings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

a -10 mv undervolt is not going to make a significant difference to anything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nothing you do is going to damage the cpu.,your computer will either run reliably or it will crash.,"when you run throttlestop and intel xtu at the same time, they are both going to be writing different voltage values to the same cpu.",i would avoid running both of these programs at the same time.,do yourself a favor and uninstall xtu.,does the ts bench 960m test run without it reporting any errors?,"if you see any errors during this test, increase your voltage until there are no errors.","if you can pass this test and your games run without any problems then everything should be ok.

if your temperatures are only 70â°c while gaming then there is no reason to undervolt.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

do you know how to edit the bios to allow undervolting again?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
either your cpu has zero ability to undervolt which is very unusual or one of your memory modules might be failing.,"when the cpu undervolt is at 0 mv, do you still get errors when running the ts bench test?",you can stop the test the moment you see an error.,some laptops use memory that is soldered to the motherboard so it is not easily replaceable.,the problem could also be the cache memory that is part of the cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gpu bottlenecks will do that.,looking at 1440p benchmarks for cpus is pointless.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i donâ€™t think this is said enough, but powerful cpus are only useful for ultra high frame rate gaming (like 240fps+) coupled with a powerful gpu, a older gen game (probably esports title) and a ultra high refresh rate monitor.","if youâ€™re not experiencing stuttering, and gaming at a high resolution (gpu bottlenecked) then a new cpu would only give you a couple more frames.","if youâ€™re on a budget and not gaming in ultra high fps, wait until youâ€™re starting to see stuttering to upgrade your cpu, that will always be biggest bang for buck",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"are we just going to ignore the fact that according to this, 12900k is just 4% ahead of 7600x?","while it isn't exactly the best purchase for the money (due to new motherboard, ram and such), i don't think this is a fair comparison.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i've never seen a more confusing, variable, and sometimes contradictory set of reviews than the zen 4 launch yesterday?","quite dramatically different claims for performance, power, and the rest.",seems to be highly sensitive to cooling setup and memory - they look to be even more fussy about overall system spec than zens 2-3. also think some testing with 4000 series nvidia cards is going to be needed to tease out some of the differences more clearly.,i think it'll be a while before we see what setups consistently make them score best.,"but you're right i think even in a well optimised environment for the 7600x, the 13600 is likely to be somewhere between slightly better and a lot better.",looks like the only compelling ryzen this gen might be the 7950x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
these are gpu capped,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13600 will be on par with 7600x and 12600 @ 1440p.,that is a gpu bottleneck scenario.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"looks like intel is no longer asleep at the wheel, great news!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there's not going to be much fps difference between the cpu being bored 70% of the time or just 50% of the time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"
this is from techpowerup with their set of gaming benchmarks.","other sets of gaming benchmarks gave the 7600x a clear lead (competing with the 12900k)

it depends on the set of games.",have to wait until one of the tech youtube channels does a massive 50 game average to get the real picture.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depending on the game you play and how competitive you are 0.1% and 1% lows may make a more expensive cpu more worth it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
basing a cpu purchasing decision on 1440p.,iq: 9000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12600k beats 7900x excuse me?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and they use a 3080 no less.,"not really sure why they don't use the 3090ti like everyone else, there would be significantly less bottleneck.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"12100 on par with the 12900ks/7950x at 4k/8k, looks like i'm getting the 13100. shows the stupidity of what they said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why?,if you game in 1440p it's nice to know if something changes with new generation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah but looking at 1080p benchmarks when you know you will never use that resolution paints artificial difference that you won't see in actual use at 1440p.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"literally every single indie game under the sun:

"oddly enough, older games that are single-cpu bound, single-core performance matters a lot.","for example, i love total war rome ii.","definitely an oldie, released sept 2013. play it w dei mod, and it will tax single-core performance on modern cpus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> but powerful cpus are only useful for ultra high frame rate gaming (like 240fps+) coupled with a powerful gpu, a older gen game (probably esports title) and a ultra high refresh rate monitor.",or 4k gaming.,or flight simulators like msfs or dcs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they are useful strictly for older strategy games that take advantage of the single thread speed, especially when heavily modded.","like for example sims3 complete edition+mods, cities skylines, stuff like that.","otherwise, for esports and most single player games, intel 9400f/ryzen 3600 is still plenty.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"what is a good cpu/gpu set up for paradox/grand strategy titles that are cpu intensive, but have huge maps that also tax the gpu when scrolling or dragging the map?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can't be more wrong.,new powerful cpu are needed for example for cyberpunk to reach more then 60 fps.,"so you were wrong its needed for 240 fps, because its needed for 60+ fps.","you are wrong about older gen game or esports title, since cyberpunk is neither.","you  were also wrong about resolution, since it doesn't matter when it comes to cpu performance in games.","if it can't deliver more then 60 fps, then thats that.",no matter at what resolution you are playing.,"so for example, new cpu could bring as much as 30-50 fps difference even on 4k with cyberpunk and 4090",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"dunno, i went from a 10850k to a 12900k and gained a lot at 1440p on games like wz and mw.",maybe a 10-15% uplift.,paired with a 3090 though so if your gpu is a bit weaker youâ€™ll see less gain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the 5800x3d is the new 1080 ti,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think just buy whatever cpu your workload requires.,that is the best way.,in some cases 5800x3d does not win out.,say for example if the user's workload is rpcs3.,"welp now with the low low low cost of intel 11900k.... hahahahaha 

the recommended cpu is an 11900k with avx512 support.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"amd till the end, because it must be the best.",mlid and jay said so!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
may be thats why 5950x3d didnt exist.... because that thing will kill entire zen4 stack.,5800x3d?,it wont kill 7900x/7950x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on your workload.,i have a 12900k and will get a 13900k but i was really impressed with the multicore benchmarks for the 7950.  i honestly think it will be faster than the 13900k in several multithreaded workloads over the 13900k.,i honestly disagree with intels approach of just adding more e cores every generation as there are only so many background tasks that can be offloaded on them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's what i'm planning on as well, just a little concerned on the pricing.",i'm hoping the supposed uk price leak isn't accurate for the us,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my 3600 will upgrade to 5800x3d as well!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have a 5600x i built a generation earlier than planned because i had time and money to spare during the pandemic lockdowns, and i think iâ€™ll just stick with it for a few gensâ€¦maybe all the way through the ddr5 era if i can manage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
isn't the 3700x more than good enough to last a few more months?,"why not wait till zen 4 x3d, if nothing else you'll get 5800 x3d for even cheaper, and best case scenario you'll get a socket that will be supported for a good amount of years along with ddr5 support and zen 4 motherboard prices would've fallen a bit by then.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you are on am4, absolutely!","it is also discounted almost 30% off right now, and dropping.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if iâ€™m gaming at 1440p, and iâ€™m looking for maximum value, why should i care about how they perform at 1080p?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm trying to use realistic hardware, not something that nobody uses in the real world.","if you want 3090 ti numbers for 1440 ti, look at 1080p.",it's just higher fps numbers and more cpu bottleneck.,4k will look exactly the same: gpu bound,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how is it out of context?,i donâ€™t give a shit about 1080p or 720p or video editing or anything else other than gaming at 1440p.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

they have [720p benchmarks](https://tpucdn.com/review/amd-ryzen-5-7600x/images/relative-performance-games-1280-720.png) specifically for that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because these charts are only useful if you happen to have the exact same gpu as the reviewer.,you have no idea if anything will change or not.,you need to look at data for the cpu and gpu independently and see which number is lower.,if you game at 1440p these numbers are still useless.,you should be able to tell if you're cpu bound as it is with your current setup and if you're not there's no point in upgrading.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then you don't know how benchmarks work or how you should use them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

they only gave support after everyone cried out and at the last minute without telling anyone they were in the process of coding support bioses so pretty much most of the people on their x370 bought new boards to get the 5800x3d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there is also the question of what game they are running to benchmark the frames per second, some will make better use of cores, others not so much, some are more intensive on cpu, others will easily bottleneck it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

any thoughts how i can make it more clear in my reviews that these are the expected results when gpu bound?,"i feel like there's a lack of explanation in my reviews, so people don't understand the results.",.. and that gpu bound is the way nearly all people play their games (or they wasted money on the gpu),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

nice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
youâ€™re right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and it's literally faster than the 7950x in many games.... in many use cases it is the single fastest cpu by a landslide.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i use kvm or esx but still it's absolutely abysmal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes that would be even better.,if they could build rocket lake with such a huge die area for mainstream cpus i don't see why they can't again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there actually is ~5% ipc increase.,the 13900k gets ~15% better single thread performance than the 12900k despite *only* ~10% higher clock speed.,"5% isn't much, but it's not the zero you claim.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

> unfortunately it was after a lot of foot dragging and uncertainty from amd.,"lol

a lot of folks conveniently forget that amd originally planned to block b450 boards from ryzen 5xxx support, with robert hallock going so far as to say it would be impossible to support.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i remember some controversy surrounding that.,"even so, it's pretty cool that zen 3 works on those first gen am4 boards.","doesn't matter now of course with am5 out, but for people who bought a decent x370 early on, that's pretty amazing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i was one of those people.,i upgraded to a cheap asrock x570.,the plan was to get a 5800x but the chip shortage hit and i ended up with a 3950x instead.,i donâ€™t think i would have been happy with the x370 anyway since i got a 6900xt and enabled sam on the new board,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,"but the fact is, it is supported.",that's one heck of a lifespan for a socket.,when did 300 series boards come out?,was it 2017?,to be able to buy a new high end cpu in 2022 and put it on a board that you bought in 2017 is pretty amazing.,"the drama at the time i'm sure wasn't cool, but the fact remains, you can put a zen 3 cpu on a 300 series board.",credit given where it's due.,was there any other platform that had that kind of longevity?,i can't think of one.,i have no idea if am5 will have that kind of longevity.,"honestly, it probably won't.","but still, even three generations would be pretty good.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
technically itâ€™s the i3-12300.,the next model up is the i5-12400.,the whole i3/i5 part is redundant marketing as the actual model is the number after that.,"like, there will never be an **i3**-12300 and an **i5**-12300.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you are gaming in 1440p, just buy cheapest i5 and you are fine.",rest of the money can go to gpu.,the higher the resolution the more gpu bottleneck become.,at 4k you are fine running i3 because of that.,comparing cpus for gaming is relevant for lower resolutions and high fps games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"looking at 1440p chart is you comparing for gpu performance, not cpu performance.",the gpu they tested with is too slow to show a meaningful performance difference between the chips.,"hence why not just pull up 4k chart, since 12300 perform exactly the same as 12600k and 7600x.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think your worst mistake was running the benchmark at 1440p using a 3080, not necessarily the 3080 itself.",the point of a cpu benchmark is that the cpu goes unrestrained and ends up being a bottleneck so running this at 1440p just caused a gpu bottleneck,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

anyway, i also really like the 12400. it's really cheap and at least for most games not that much worse than the 12600/12700.",i expect the same for the 13400.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if you plan on sticking to one gpu forever - the test has some value.,else it's trash as there's bottlenecking all over the place and their scores doesn't even remotely line up with other sites.,"""test"" on a 3080 is just a curiosity, it provides no useful data, besides ""how does the combo work"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you said that the 7950x got worse power consumption single core in cinebench even though the 12900k and 7950x score within margin of error in that test.,"single core scores stay basically the same on the 7950x, even at 65w.","the 7950x only draws a lot of power if you give it a lot of power, it's extremely efficient if you want it to be.","amd didn't just ramp up the power to get to the top of the charts, the new pbo is pretty smart tbh",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> yes, all those points are correct.","i saw that too and agree with those facts, but how does that invalidate what i said about zen 4?","(which was specific in reply to the comment above)

i think you all discussed it to death, but i just want to point out that, it isn't a competition on being right.",i don't have any skin in either amd or intel even though my two last cpus are intel.,"the point is that, intel pushed power to get to the top.",not because they had a sounder architectural design and better manufacturing node than amd/tsmc.,"of course, this year we see both amd and intel push, but i was talking about last generation.","a cpu line from 2020 competing with late 2021.

beyond that zen4 is still extremely power efficient compared to alder lake even if amd is allowing you to draw more power for more performance.",that's very different than being less power efficient.,amd is clearly more power efficient than alder lake and likely raptor lake.,even intel themselves admit that they don't expect performance/watt to be comparable for a few more years.,"so basically saying amd is doing it as well, isn't as accurate in my opinion.",vastly different circumstances.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>i don't get what the downvotes are for.,i'm not painting a false narrative here.,probably because you keep making bad faith arguments about the power consumption of the 7950x.,"i'm giving you the benefit of the doubt and assuming you aren't actually this dense, but rather just trolling.",the power usage is barely ~3% higher than the 12900k in blender and trounces all over it in performance.,"it receives a similar beating in hub's 7950x review, but with less power consumption (since we're splitting hairs over a couple of watts here.)",>are we not concerned about power consumption anymore?,why aren't you this enthusiastic about the power consumption of the 12900k?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

well not really.,"in the context of all the data they make available, tests at 1080p, 1440p and 2160p, you get to see how the cpu might scale at different resolutions, and that can help a buyer decide the cutoff point, cpu wise, of diminishing returns for their use-case.",that's valuable.,"that was just one of many charts they make available, and i think op cherry picked it to support confirmation bias.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the 12500 is worth it over the 12400 only if you plan on using the igpu.,"otherwise itâ€™s kind of in no manâ€™s land and you might as well save money and get the 12400f, or spend a tiny bit more and get the 12600.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

>7950x only draws a lot of power if you give it a lot of power, it's extremely efficient if you want it to be.",this statement is pretty much true for all cpus.,we have seen the massive efficiency gains of even alder lake's top-end sku when underclocked slightly or undervolted.,why?,simply because the 12900k is juiced to the gills from the factory in order to eke out maximum performance.,"it's literally the same thing as what amd is doing with zen 4, which comes back to what i said in my original post.","eco mode is amd's branding of switching to a profile which restricts clocks and therefore, power use.",it's good in a sense that it makes it user friendly to underclock but the same can be done through intel xtu or ryzen master.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bad faith?,trolling?,what?,"i am not sure how things are perceived over the internet (or maybe i'm just not that good at conveying it) but how is it bad faith when my comments are clearly in specific context to power consumption, which is exactly what a user's pc will experience when running the same or similar workloads as said reviewers.",are we denying that these peak power figures don't matter or that they won't materialize in consumer pcs?,cause they sure do with the 12900k.,did you see people making excuses for intel during the launch of the 12900k?,"also,

"of course not, not when testing cpus.",there's like 30% gap between 3080 and 3090 ti in 1440p performance.,"first off, there's already ada and rdna3 on the horizon.","then a person can lower graphics settings and at some point, he'll hit cpu limit you did not hit, because you chocked the gpu and restrained cpu.","720p is absolutely non-representative, as there's no vram load, on 3080 ti with 12700k and 4000 mhz dr b-die ram cyberpunk 2077 720p ultra produces \~200 fps (non cpu heavy spot) on 90% gpu utilization and 205 w power draw on gpu and 110 on cpu, whereas 1080p does 150 fps.","on 93% gpu utilization, 250 w and 90 w respectively.",there's absolutely no gpu bottleneck per se and yet there's heavy fps drop and power draw switch.,"your cpu methodology in gaming tests a scenario, not a cpu.",hence your scores are unusable and unscientific.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

and i doubt that people who drop this much on a cpu don't inform themselves how it works.",and just because the 7950x can draw more power given sufficient cooling doesn't mean that it's less power **efficient** than the 12900k.,"like i stated, the 7950x at 65w is already faster than the 12900k at 200+w.",and at full power it's like 40% faster while not drawing 40% more power from the wall.,performance per watt on zen4 is even more impressive than zen3 mobile,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it is simply put thee best.",most normal aio radiator coolers are #1 not as affordable.,and #2 the artic liquid freezer 2 aio has a thicker radiator.,so 240mm means 2x120mm fans slapped together (120mm x 120mm like a square.),"but it is 1.5 inches thick....

normal 240mm radiators are 1.0 inch thick.",so by default the alf2 aio is 50% thicker.,so it features 50% more radiator and more surface area (because it is thicker so the fins are a bit longer) mean more cooling.,despite being a compact package.,240mm.,i have that one.,that is good enough.,"because it is 1.5 inch thick, it can at times match a much larger 360mm rad.",those 360mm rads are 3 - 120mm square fans slapped together with a 1 inch thick rad.,the only advantage is the additional fan.,on top of great performance the alf2 aio is dead silent.,it just costs a bit more than your current fan.,but you can resell or return your fan and buy that bad boy i listed above.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™d say thereâ€™s a good chance the cooler canâ€™t handle a 12700k.,the pure rock 2 is more of a mid range cooler and the 12th gen i7/i9s can draw a lot of power.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"its fine, i just pulled the cooler out of an old rig i had and the thermal paste from the old rig wasn't that good, so i just wiped it off and added arctic thermal paste and its down.",as /u/sultry_eyes mentioned though.,"probably in a couple of weeks i'm gonna grab a good aio cooler, and extra fans for my case.",i ordered like 9 cheap fans but for some reason they only had enough screws for 3 fans :/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you really need to determine that by how your current system is performing.,"if your gpu is pegged at 90%+ and your cpu is nowhere near that, then a cpu upgrade likely wonâ€™t offer much performance boost.","if the opposite is true, then a cpu upgrade will help.","as for what you need, i think a baseline for a good budget-y gaming pc is the 12400. the 12700k - and 13700k - would be more for a premium gaming pc that might be doing a lot more, like rendering.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would wait.,new systems are on the horizon and 6/16 is more than capable.,i would personaly wait until next year for the next and with intel i would even wait for 14. series espetialy when you mostly game on your pc.,you will be always gpu  bottlenecked anyway for 1440p+.,"i have 9400f and some games realy need stronger cpu (games like cyberpunk, modern ac games) but my gpu is holding me a lot more at 1440p.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i mean a 12100f is basically faster in everything.,gaming mostly cares about single thread performance.,especially if you buy one of those msi mortar max boards and do some bclk overclocking.,my 12100f ar 5.4 gbz destroys a stock 12900k in terms of average fps lol.,"and even in non gaming tasks, alder lake is so much faster per clock that the 12100f is still faster than an 8700k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i realy wanted to upgrade y cpu earlier this year to 12100f but i found out it is not by much faster than 9400f.,i beleive that you are still fine with 8700k.,when you game at 1440p you will mostl likely push gpu much more.,i had cpu bottleneck in cyberpunk in areas with high density population or in ac odyssey in bigger cities such as athens.,"but other than that, old six core holds pretty well.",if your system works without any issues just wait for implemenation of ddr5 and other next gen features.,we are at the beginning of the era.,also newer cpus benefit from higher frequency memory espetialy 10. series up.,so you would have to probably change you ram from 2666 to 3200 if you already dont have one (or overclock if possible).,current cpu would be probably more power efficienet though.,"sorry for my bad grammer, not a native speaker.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"you're not really undervolting, since the voltage at 4.7 ghz clock should be unchanged.",you're just skipping the occasional brief blips of higher voltage when you would boost above 4.7 ghz.,not sure this is the best approach.,in theory you were only boosting above 4.7 ghz at light load anyway.,saving more power when the cpu isn't using much doesn't make as big a difference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
\>just skipping the occasional brief blips of higher voltage when you would boost above 4.7 ghz.,seems more sensible to have a fixed all core ratio then letting the cpu go up and down between 4.7ghz-5ghz while gaming.changes like that while playing game can cause micro stutters.,in theory there should be no issues if i put a 4.7ghz all core ratio and leave it like that right?,(cpu is gonna boost to 4.7ghz anyway on its own when playing) like you said it avoids the blimps of higher power while keeping the core ratio as stable as possible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"\>you're not really undervolting, since the voltage at 4.7 ghz clock should be unchanged.",you're just skipping the occasional brief blips of higher voltage when you would boost above 4.7 ghz.,that could also be it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
technically it should yes but its close to nothing.,it's cpu usage the real thing that drives power usage.,high performance powerplan basically does the same thing but the core ratio on high performance is more erratic since like i said on default he cpu core ratio goes up to 5ghz.,putting a 47 manual all core ratio on the cpu is more of a thing to make cpu core more fixed/less erratic.,(the upside is less voltage needed because it doesnt have to account going over 4.7ghz in my case),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ignore base, it's basically irrelevant, unless you're buying the worst motherboard possible, and even then it may not even matter for only a locked i5.","boost clocks are what's important, boost clocks have been increasing every generation since skylake, although boosts between 11th gen and 12th gen were almost identical (single-core boost is the same, but all-core appears to have dropped by 200mhz, but doesn't matter since it has higher ipc).","-|single-core|all-core

6th gen (skylake) - 10th gen (comet lake) there was no ipc increase, so they had to increase the frequency each generation to offer some improvement over the previous generation, they also offered a thread/core count increase after 7th gen, 6th and 7th gen were basically identical outside of frequency increase and better igpu.",11th gen there was an ipc increase.,"12th gen there was both an ipc increase and die shrink (without a die shrink, you'll see increased power consumption and latency, which was part of why 11th gen didn't do so well, the die was also enormous, at least compared to 10th gen and prior, at least for what 11th gen offered)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

because they can operate more efficiently every gen?,"just a guess

not a big deal as long as the max clock speed is powerful enough",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i guess chips keep asking more and more watts, so a way to ensure some guaranteed minimum speeds on your default cooler, base clock has to go down.","but in practice, you rarely see base clock performance, decent coolers can let the chip rock turbo speeds almost effortlessly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ipc gain they can do more for less, ontop a 4.0ghz base and 4.9ghz boost dont sound as good as a 3.6ghz base and 4.9ghz boost does it?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel decides where they want the part to sit in the price/performance range of the product line.,they then can set the clock speed (among other factors) accordingly.,so 10th gen needed 2.9ghz base to reach the required performance profile for the given price.,!2th gen only needed 2.5ghz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so they can quote low ""tdp"" numbers while the actual power draw for the high boost clocks are usually much higher.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
base clock is the minimum clock speed intel says you will hit while staying within the 65w tdp.,"it has nothing to do with how fast the processor is, just how much power it consumes.","base clock decreased going from skylake to rocket lake because rocket lake runs hot as hell, so to keep power constant a lower clock was needed.","the 100 mhz drop with alder lake is more confusing since i think it should be more efficient than rocket lake, but it's also the first desktop processor on the new node, so possibly they wanted to be conservative in case they ran into the infamous 10nm yield issues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"because ipc increase, i could be wrong though",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the boost frequency of one core can be higher when the other cores run at a lower base frequency.,i think that it is the main motive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i like to think it runs cooler and uses less power when idle.,seems like a good idea to me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if anything itâ€™s an efficiency thing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is what i figure makes sense too.,a low-ish level power and performance level to hit a certain expected number of performance can be had at a lower clock after node shrink and improvements.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ha!,ðÿ˜‚,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is the correct answer and i'm confused how all the others are being upvoted considering they're incorrect.,the tdp 'essentially' represents the power consumption at a particular thermal envelope.,"in order for intel chips to still respect the 65w tdp, they need to lower the 'base clock'.","the higher the clock speeds, the higher the tdp needed.",so they post a friendly looking tdp like 65w and publish low base clocks that represent that tdp level.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"thereâ€™s nothing about the cpu that would prevent you from doing that, but it would be dependant on lenovo allowing you to customize the power levels.","or, perhaps theyâ€™re already locked to fixed levels.",tiny systems usually have fixed maximums to prevent cpu upgrades from overwhelming cooling or vrms.,no need to mess around with frequencies though.,just set the power levels and let it manage itself automatically.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msi pro b660-a is a very good choice.. i have the matx version with a 12400f.. it's good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[pcpartpicker](https://pcpartpicker.com),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12400f is more powerful but if you can get a ryzen 5600 + motherboard for significantly cheaper i would consider that option too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"price to performance, especially if youâ€™re okay with ddr4, is very strong at i5 and below for intel vs ryzen.",12400f is a great 6 core chip for its price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

definitely a cpu bottleneck,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dont listen to the guy.,"3060ti is comparable to 2080, which is the high end card of the previous generation.",pair it with a beefier cpu like 12600k or 12400f at least.,also get like 16gb ram (2x8gb ram) at least.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes, historically, intel always were in a way better position financially.","and yes, it needs to be said, intel is now money-constrained, now more than ever before in their whole history.","the bank intel is no more, it vanished.","back then, intel could spend god knows how many billion usd on their failed 64-bit x86-replacement itanium, the industry's single-worst âµarch which has ever existed to date, by trying to create and later outdo amd64, when it was a failed approach from the very beginning and they stubbornly wasted years and billions to ignore that simple fact.","intel also spend about +$140 billion on their â»intel insideâ«-program, to pay for retailers' advertising to illegally push their cpus and products into the market and push every other competitor out of the market.","was knifed 2018.

before, intel could mindlessly sink $12 billion usd into the mobile market, by trying to outprice anything arm in their approach to outdo any competition by selling their atoms well below manufacturing-costs.","it failed spectacularly, they got a bloody nose from it and intel failed to create any mainstay in the mobile market and is still a nobody there.","before, intel could mindlessly sink $18-21 billion usd officially (unofficially, experts say it was more like $23-25bn) on their modem- and mobile-endeavors, trying to create any meaningful 3g- or lte-modems for almost a decade.",they failed spectacularly on this as well and had to toss the whole division by selling it for cents on a dollar to apple.,"before, intel also could sink $5-10 billions on optane trying to maintain a dead-end product into life, whcih had no greater reason to exist, since it wasn't any economically viable to manufacture, no matter the feelings.","in any past, intel also always could run massive programs on share-buybacks and this way sunk +140 billion usd on share-buybacks, often on a tanking stock (which in an off itself is a recipe for disaster) to stabilise their stock.","intel *always* could do that, and rather mindlessly waste a sh!tton of money, since they had their money printing machines called xeon and core, their given nice and comforting backdoor-deals (which secured them future contracts and guaranteed them especially huge sales), which literally printed them money all day long.","----
*though all that is no more, since amd cut them lose from that with their ryzen, threadripper and especially epycs.","*

oh, and the competition has skyrocketed in some even exponentially increased competitive landscape, where it feels like *everyone* does their own designs (occasionally even better than intel itself), intel is needed way less (despite being never so utterly un-competitive with so little perspective of regaining the upper hand ever again) and their sale-numbers of largely less expensive sold (yet still vastly expensive to manufacture) cpus and chips are dwindling by the weeks, which results in their revenue and especially their profits being in free fall .. *wait for q3 these days!","*

intel is the one in the market, which has likely the highest manufacturing costs of all of them, yet has to sell their skus for way less than ever before with ever-crippling margins due to fierce competition.",*a recipe for destruction*.,"----
*today*, intel is a heavily indebted company with +$30 billion in debts, has a huge mountain to climb in their own backyard in financing their node-buildouts (to advance any further to be able to create anything meaningful and especially competitive!","), lags years behind in process-technology to the point that they have to fab externally and costly outsource designs to third-parties (and even accept way thinner margins by doing so), just to bring their chips to some extremely financially stressful market with the utmost competitive pressure the company has ever faced.","though let's not forget, that their fabs' maintaining-costs are prone to eat them up alive.","amd ditched that ..

the worst part is, that intel still has largely none whatsoever recipe or solution on the majority of their own internal problems, and not only time but especially money is running out on them quick these days.",**tl;dr:** intel forgot about tick-tock.,"now time is running out on them, and the clock is ticking faster then ever.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we don't yet know how much cheaper amd's approach has been.,"if it turns out there's still a decent profit margin under 900 usd, and there might, amd could just kneecap nvidia's entire generation in one swoop.","while.unlikely, it would be a hell of a sight to behold.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yup, it seems that amd again might attack the very *achilles heel* which already brought down intel already (yet still not humbled them to date!","), the financial point of 'just producing cheaper and sell with a smaller margin'.","not gonna lie, but it feels like the prominent middle-finger to intel and nvidia, like a c0cky:

does it do it with a bunch of different backgrounds?,not psu...driver issue...but you did not even say what gpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did some tes on heaven benchmark and it seems okay to me at least,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can you change to another?,looks like a corrupted jpeg to me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that means that problem is not coming to hardware... maybe you just moved the image that you set as a background to another location, and windows has its own thing that scrambles the background image.",just don't worry about the hardware problems as long as the pc works reliably.,you have to accept microsoft's windows os bugs...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>i did changed the wallpaper and after a while it still occurs in that wallpaper... i tried to change the resolution from 1360x720 to 1366x720(i'm using a tv) and it works for awhile but again it appears... i don't have an idea what could cause this bug,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if it happens elsewhere with graphics, i would say failing memory on the video card.","if it only ever happens in this one specific area, i would likely think software / driver issue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at this point i want one for the novelty but hard to recommend over whatâ€™s most compatible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i see that as a fair price imo but like why not go for a 6600xt or 6700,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
where do you see 3070 ti for $400?!?,i doubt that intel price it against amd.,"they're coming out with nvidia's hardware and software feature set, and they've only been comparing to nvidia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're not grabbing a brand new rtx 3070 ti on sale for $400.,"you can't even get a 3060ti for that price, unless its a founder's edition from best buy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they either do low quantity on non super low prices to just get some ""testers"" without committing to marketshare and then do that with battle mage.",or they will start flooding laptops and dgpu with arc just to get wide coverage when they decide it's stable enough for launch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"agreed, and in meantime they can perfect their drivers in 1-2 year, but they will loose some money or selling them with almost no profit but if they succeed then we will have 3 gpu players and lower prices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the price has to be competitive to the real-world benchmarks.,itâ€™s as simple as that.,"if itâ€™s nearly as fast as a 3070, it needs to cost less than a 3070.

the cheapest new 3070 currently on newegg is $500.",3070ti is $570.,where are you finding those readily and easily available brand new for $400?,at $400 iâ€™m seeing 3060 and rx6700/rx6650xts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"with amd and nvidia being plentiful , i see no reason to buy these cards.",why buy are card that will have issue and issue,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'll buy one.,i want the 770 le,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's supposed to align with an rx6600 at best, so $230, max (current price of most 6600's)

rt is still a gimmick so even if it's 3060ti in rt it doesn't matter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
220$,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at $400us (probably $650au) i'd be keen.,realistically that's about the cost of a 3060/ti or cheap 6700.  if intel have the driver under control by now it might be worth it.,besides if nobody buys arc series would they bother making battlemage?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a 6650xt is under $300 now on amazon and at bestbuy and at the least will beat the a750.,in the $370-$400 range is the 6700/6700xt which will beat them both.,intel needs to be mad cheap.,wait for benchmarks though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"day 1 preorder for me, this card fits my needs perfectly and the newer gen from competitors all frankly are overkill and it doesn't make sense for me to spend the extra money in the least based on performance i have seen.",not expecting perfection but the card looks to be coming out of the gate in a solid state.,"very interested where we will be 12 months from now, in terms of overall driver state and the games coming with day 1 upscaling and or rt support akin to nvidia and dlss titles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep.,"6650 xts are getting really cheap, the a770 will at the very least need to undercut that card.",my limitâ€™s $299.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if theyâ€™re competitive with â€˜700 classâ€™ amd and nvidia gpus in *most games* (and we know thereâ€™ll be some issues) and are at a lower price, i think theyâ€™ll be a good buy?",this is a bit like amdâ€™s 5000 series - but more so -  we know the driver improvements over the next 12-24 months could potentially add another 10-15% performance on top of however itâ€™s performing at release.,"so long as itâ€™s priced for its actual performance at release, might be very worthwhile and potentially better value than the price equivalent cards.",time for intel to brand its janky drivers as â€˜finewineâ€™!,if it works for the competitionâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ve been waiting for a 3070ti on sale but i might take the plunge and grab a a770 16gb.,iâ€™m mostly cad/cam and i think itâ€™ll be sufficient.,the only game thatâ€™s likely on my horizon will be bg3 once itâ€™s out of early release.,iâ€™m inclined to wait on second gen intel myself but i think enough early adopters will give intel the sales numbers they need to push forward so at 400cad iâ€™m willing to be a guinea pig.,best case scenario they end up making great cards.,worst case it might force nvidia to lower prices on mid range gpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
prices aside how does it fare against the 3070??,does it have ray tracing and something like dldsr or dlss?,?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah if it's $350ish max then i'll grab one for the novelty.,"either arc takes off and i'll have their first real ""big"" gpu that started everything, or arc fades away and it'll be a unique piece of hardware history.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if they price it against nvidia why wouldn't you just get the amd card.,they're a novelty card with no practical reason to buy aside from av1.,"all the cards have the same av1 functionality so, grab the a380 or buy amd/nvidia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"poland but it's the shittiest tier card kfa2 1 click oc with a dual fan, i'd be scared of using that shit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i just checked google, seems like the entire world is selling 3060ti for $300-$360.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah that seem like their entire plan rn, sell it low, get people to switch with amazing price to performance, then release more competitive cards as drivers mature and they get better technology.",at least i hope.,"would be nice to see a good 3rd competitor, especially if jensen is giving gamers two giant middle fingers right now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's not how it works for a new market entrant.,"they need to compete on price or nobody is going to buy their gpus, period.","$25-50 less isn't going to get it done, they need to price it materially less, even if it means taking a slight loss in this first gen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you have money to spend and you want a cool different gpu ðÿ¤·â€â™‚ï¸,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as gamer you have no reason to buy these cards(intel arc gpus), these cards comes useful for the grown ups doing heafty data crunching and ai gpu acceleration for machine/deep learning tasks.",this is a billion dollar industry whoâ€™s looking for the best deals on gpu tech at price to performance.,"tensor cores is the reason why iâ€™ll buy this card over amd/nvidia, for few reasons, guaranteed getting 8+ years of driver support from intel and the drivers are usually open sourced, which means i can use them on freebsd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lmao ðÿ¤£,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i agree.,the a380 blew away my 3070ti for video rendering in av1 and close to 3070ti speeds for other codecs but for gaming if it didn't crash it couldn't compare to a 3070ti for gaming performance but for the price depending on the use it's a formidable card once they fix the driver stability.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you end up getting one?,i'm trying to get an a770 for collection purposes but there is  none available,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no they don't have the same av1 functionality at the lower price points, only intel does and it looks like it will be that way until sometime next year.","and amd also doesn't have ai upscaling or ai cores, or anywhere near the media engine performance.","i'm not arguing what the better buy is, just stating the differences at the lower price points.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

pump speed?,also what workload are you running to get 80c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my i7-8700k on stock will easily get to 80â°c on full load - and often hotter - on air cooling.,the voltage draw on that cpu is crazy.,it seems to draw a huge amount even if it's not overclocked.,i set a manual vcore of 1.18 and that was stable for stock clocks and the temperature is always under 80â°c on full load / stress tests now.,maybe see how much voltage is being drawn when it's getting hot (use hwinfo or similar) and then see if you can undervolt without losing performance but getting those temperatures down?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what rpm are the fans spinning at when youâ€™re recording those temps?,does opening the side of the case change the result at all?,is the pc in an enclosed space?,is the cpu running at stock?,have you googled something like â€œtroubleshooting high cpu temps with aioâ€ and tried the ideas that come up?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2500 rpm playing modern warfare,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
around 2300 rpm.,itâ€™s running stock voltage and opening the side didnâ€™t really do anything noticeable imo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

im stupid",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"since skylake (xeon e3 1200v5) they will only post in motherboards with c series chipsets because intel restricted other combinations, but there were firmware modding related to the intel me that allowed to run them on desktop boards: https://winraid.level1techs.com/t/guide-how-to-run-skylake-and-kaby-lake-xeons-on-100-series-chipsets/33044/2  
however, i have no idea about the most recent generations, just that it was possible in skylake.","i don't have memories of seeing this performed on coffee lake and later, because xeons are now significantly more expensive than core counterparts so you aren't going to buy them to use on a desktop board like in the old days.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not sure if possible, but since it's unlikely your bios would recognize the xeon you'd probably need to hack it at least.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's not that's why i'm asking.,"neither were the e series xeons on the h67 boards, but they worked anyway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"what you're describing about xeons e3 supporting udimm ecc and being a ""pro"" version of the consumer socket has been the case since the original sandy bridge xeon e3 1200 (v1).","previously you had two chipsets from the c series, a low end one that supported ecc but didn't allowed you to use the processor igp (for pure servers, either headless or bmc video output) and a higher end one that did (say, c222 and c226 during haswell/broadwell).","the w series is pretty much equivalent to the high end, igp capable c one.","what intel changed on alder lake is that there seems to be no actual xeon e line, they just added ecc support to the standard core lineup whereas previously it was only available on a few low end pentium/core i3 because there were no low end xeon counterparts.",and the w chipset now is a crossbreed of c and z chipsets since it supports ecc and allows overclocking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the i3s are definitely getting up there .iâ€™d say the i5s like 12400f have surpassed older generations quite quickly however intel was stuck on 14nm for a long time, and we did not it see much change from 10-11gen so where probably not use to see much of generational improvement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
things have been moving pretty fast the last few generations now that intel and amd are once again in a race.,a 12th gen i3 will offer the same amount of cores/threads an i7 from a few generations back did.,a 12th gen i5 will beat an 8th gen i7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes.,adl p-cores are really way stronger than whatever intel made the 5 years prior.,"this also means shopping for used old cpus, motherboards etc is completely pointless now when they can't compete with 12100. the price of x99 compatible xeons for example dropped like a rock over the last year.",you can get something like 2666 or 2680 for almost nothing because they are just not worth it anymore compared with new builds.,they held up value for so long.,12100 and h610 motherboard is similarly priced to some chinese motherboards and xeon cpu and it performs way better with a lot less power.,"if you are going to ultra value build or a home server, that is the way.",x99 platform still has ddr4 ecc though and it has quad channel memory and more lanes but that's going to be quite expensive to build still.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

>i'm trying to upgrade my ram memory from a single 16gb dual rank crucial memory (the streamers factory ram sticks you can find) to a corsair lpx vengeance 2x 16gb kit (appears to be single rank).,"since you have quad channel memory you should install 4 dimms, not 2.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> but i was told that it may be the case that my i7 7800x simply doesn't support single rank memory.,"that wouldn't make much sense since it's usually the opposite, the more ranks per channel the harder it is to get stable, which usually forces you to run lower clocks.","i'd start off with resetting bios, if that doesn't work try each of the new sticks one at a time (may want to even try them in different slots), if one works and the other doesn't, then it's a bad stick, *maybe* could also be a bad memory slot, although i'm leaning towards no since i *think* that would just cause it to not show the memory but still start, unless it's one bad stick and a bad slot.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why then does my old ram stick - which is single channel - work and not these ones?,and the old one is configured in slot a1.,"manual recommends c1 if you're doing a single stick, but yet that works fine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i added a clarification.,the person meant that it doesn't support or isn't as optimal with 1 rank with this configuration of having 2x 16gb ram.,"according to him, it may be that my cpu doesn't like 16gbit but rather 8gbit memory density.",something along these lines.,that's also why i mentioned my bios because i'm wondering if updating this specific board's bios wil allow it to work with 16gbit memory density(not gb),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can run one channel ram too.,it's just slow and a waste of an expensive quad channel motherboard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

update: ok, so it's advisable to buy a kit of 4x8gb instead of buying them 2x8gb kits separately, simply because you know the 4x kit was tested together so chances of failure are lower than two separate kits (even if they are the same everything).","found 4x8gb from the same brand and model, just at a premium price.",but i'll give it ago.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you can't undervolt anymore if the laptop has had a bios update.,the new bios generally disabled them due to vulnerablity.,you will need to find a way to downgrade the bios update and keep windows from auto-update it for it to work.,most laptops don't have a way to do that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

nope.,c1 and d1 is for a dual channel cpu.,"you have a quad channel cpu and the table for that is on page 28.

verify cpu dual/quad architecture with the color of the s/k led as indicated on the same page.",1 module should be in c1 apparently.,"if that doesnâ€™t work then iâ€™m not sure whatâ€™s up, because i donâ€™t see anything about that memory that should make it incompatible assuming corsair says it will work.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
interesting!,"i was under the false perception that it simply mean i'm able to use quad channel max, not that i needed to do that.",makes a lot of sense why the people that built this for me installed the first the single ram it came with in  a1.,"but to understand you currently, if i were to just run 1 of the sticks in either c1 or a1 should it still work or will it fail because it needs both cards installed?",asking because i tried testing then one at a time in a1 (where the original/old ram was) and also c1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as far as i know it should work with modules installed incorrectly, but not wellâ€¦ and maybe not at all.","i just know when thereâ€™s issues itâ€™s best to eliminate something thatâ€™s known to cause problems, like using the wrong slots.","also be sure you are actually installing them in the right slots, because they are numbered weird on that board.","b1-b2-a1-a2 (cpu) c2-c1-d2-d1

"yeah i've cleared cmos multiple times, but again, i never tried installing it in c1 and a1.",could be the case that doing that fixes it all.,"and someone said that i'm supposed to clear cmos with the new sticks in, is that right?","i'm to all this so any guide on best approach when it comes to doing resets, would be helpful!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"instead of being numbered 1212 as on the left, itâ€™s 2121. mirrored.","so a1 (the third slot) on the left side becomes d2 for the equivalent (third) slot on the right side, not d1 like you might think.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"so for simplicityâ€™s sake, this [visual](https://imgur.com/a/rmnafpo) is what you basically mean, right?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah, thatâ€™s correct, although i think the diagram on 28 is a bit easier to follow (theyâ€™re identified directly below each slot).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

update: didn't work.,"cleared cmos (i know that went through well because i got the prompt when i put my old stick back in saying that it was reset), put it in the channels you recommend (a1 and c1), but didn't work.","also i'm 100% confident i also installed it properly (at this  point i've taken both my old and new sticks out close to a dozen times) 1 click on the left, 1 click on the right till it fully closes and push it down a bit more until it doesn't budge.","it's seeming more the case that these cards are either faulty (unlikely if it's 2 cards, but still a possibility now) or it has to do with with rank incompatibility.",more specifically that my cpu may only be able to process 8gbit per chip while these cards are processing at 16gbit.,it's a theory so i'm waiting to find out more from corsair.,but this seems more plausible.,any idea if bios update would address this?,my bios version is dated 2017. but i haven't touched this cause of the risks i've heard that's possible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're z390 doesn't have pcie 4.0 and that's probably an issue with the 4090 for performance.,not sure though.,otherwise the 9900k would still be perfectly viable at 4k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"9900 is fine for 4k, (way lower cpu load at 4k vs 1080).",if you are hardcore esports player @ 1080 then new cpu would show much more of a difference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it depends on what fps you want to play at.,"if you want 120+ fps at 4k, then a 9900k is not enough.","a 9900k will bottleneck a 3090/4090 in modern cpu-demanding games like bf2042 or in older games that rely on a few threads, like crysis or black mesa.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"13th gen isn't even out, yet.","if you're going to buy the flagship card anyway, why not just wait and see if you're satisfied with it on your current platform and reassess from there?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is minimal difference between pcie gen3 and gen4.,a few percent at best.,"depending on what games you play, you may still be gpu bound, although weâ€™ll have to wait for actual tests.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have a i9 10850k and it keeps up with my rtx 3080ti,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for 4k its perfectly fine.,pcie doesnt really matter either.,"4090 has 24gb ram, you wont be streaming from system ram as much.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

exactly this i had a 9900 ks @ 5.2 ghz all core and 32gb ddr4 @ 4133 cl 16-16-16-36 and it bottle necked my 3080 in some games and bottle necked my 3090 ti pretty bad even in 1440p .,12900 ks @ 5.4 solved that.,4k it will not as bad but still will,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ha, hadnâ€™t even noticed that.",pcie 4.0 with a gen5 power connector.,thatâ€™s not gonna cause any confusion among consumers!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[removed],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wish intel stops launching products before they are ready.,just like they do with desktop chips.,give a definite date when they will be on shelf or donâ€™t even paper launch it until you have a date when theyâ€™ll be on shelves.,"i know this doesnâ€™t work with 3rd party oem products (laptops, pre-builds, etc).",intel has to work to get some credibility back here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no shit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just want to know if i'll be able to get an a770 aib card before the year is out.,i don't feel like that's asking too much.,i'd rather know that they won't be available for x amount of time than keep waiting for paper launch dates that are sooner but don't materialize.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am still massively rooting for them but this is the worst product release i can think of...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so who will take a photo with the arc graphics card next and post it on twitter with the text ""shipping very soon!",""", we had raja, pat?","maybe dr. randhir thakur, the supply chain mastermind.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"at this point, even with broken drivers they should have launched it.",people that wanted the card would have still bought it.,"first the nvidia disappointment, now this.",release the card already!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's obvious they are waiting for the drivers to be better before releasing the cards especially since reviewers only really review cards with the day 1 drivers.,this is why most companies like nvidia only announce their products when they are ready to be released.,intel made a mistake and announced these cards way too early.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"thing is intel doesn't have infinite money, and margins have been thing recently.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i donâ€™t think intel would be doing all this to release it for what a year and then just sunset it.,i think for once mlid is wrong on this.,also the way he is quietly delivering updated news on arc and not mentioning it being a â€œdead end productâ€ reaffirms that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sorry for the double reply.,i mean i think it makes sense.,"if intel launched their cards before 4000 series dropped, and they set their prices too high, it would have been a disaster.",we see now the outragesouly high pricing for nvidia 4000 series.,and there are reports of excess 3000 series stock.,"along with a renaming structure whereby 4070 is now renamed 4080.

in this way, nvidia 3000 series new\* and used\* cards are still very appealing to the consumer.",of course intel is not just gunning for nvidia.,they will take aim at amd as well.,amd has competitive cards (despite poor rt and limited ai upscaling software).,amd had the node advantage in the last generation.,but they will be announcing/launching soon too.,"in this way, if intel waits (due to their delay) they can;

1. buy time for their drivers team to mature the drivers for a better user experience
2. wait for nvidia pricing/performance and undercut them.",3. wait for amd pricing/performance and undercut them.,because let's face it.,we know their legacy driver is no good.,they've publically stated it.,performance for dx12 and vulkan is likely good/on par.,so the key for intel will be pricing.,and yeah well the drivers.,that's why i figure it is a strategic move for them to wait being as it is so close to their competition launching their new cards.,cheers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but would launching now be advisable?,costs are going up.,amd and nvidia are readying new cards to launch.,i think intel is waiting at least for amd to announce their pricing.,then they can correctly launch and price their cards based upon the new competition and the current markets of used gpus flooding in along with any fluctuating price scenarios.,that's just my opinion of course.,i could be wrong.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not a bad upgrade if you can get a really good deal on the 11700f.,assuming you have an adequate motherboard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same socket not same chip.,support only with w480 chipset.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yep thatâ€™s my current mobo :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh wait it seems there's a version of the a pro without a vrm heatsink.,i'm guessing yours doesnt have a heatsink to the left side of the cpu socket over the vrms.,it will still run within the stock power limits provided the case has good airflow but it will run hotter on the motherboard vrms than a board with adequate heatsinks would do.,the 11700f is 65w at stock which is pretty conversative so no issues there and if its a gaming pc 65w but perfectly fine.,so yes it will run fine just you won't want to increase power limits to unlimited on that board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there are tons and tons of drivers and devices on motherboards and if you just move to a new cpu/motherboard/chipset youâ€™re going to leave performance on the table without a fresh install.,thereâ€™s also a chance of long term stability issues or micro stutter issues.,"you might get away with it, but with a platform change itâ€™s always a best practice to reinstall windows.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the m22 has been recalled and discontinued by nzxt anyways for having pumps that almost invariably die within 6 or 12 months as well as just being a poorly performing cooler in general.,it absolutely will not do for a 12700k even with a functioning pump.,"send it back to nzxt and get something decent, the rest of the kraken x and z lineup are decent but you'll most likely want a 280 or 360 rad aio for a 12700k as it is quite a hot cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you only need to wipe your drive on which your current windows install resides.,other drives containing data can be moved without any problems.,i would advice to disconnect all disks in the system save for the one you will be installing windows on.,that way you can't make a mistake during setup and wipe the wrong drive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i am only looking to spend about $1000 for an upgrade, as money grows tighter each year, trying to find the best budget upgrade.","my main concern is if the 12700k will be an upgrade and not a side grade, and would it last for another 5 to 6 years.",i only upgrade my cpu every 5 to 6 years.,thanks for the info btw,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, that is what i am hoping and kinda trying to preplan now.",nothing is set in stone.,"my cpu is working, as best as expected, but i am hoping for a price drop, i wasnt sure, but everything i reads shows a decent upgrade.","and i know i wont see any real change in fps, but in multi tasking is where it should increase-also in cpu demanding apps right?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its not about 2 more fps.,it is about trying to future proof my cpu.,will the i7 9700k be able to run triple a titles in 4 years or 5 years without cpu issues?,will my cpu even survive 5 years of 100% usage?,"the i7 12700k is looking really nice for the price, and i can pretty much reuse all my existing internals.","like when i game, i cant stream to twitch because i am at 100% cpu usage already, so my fps just tanks,  even on discord, i sometimes become robo man, due to 100% usage.","but if i am just gaming, nothing else, yeah, the cpu works amazing, cant lie.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13th gen uses ddr4 also and 13600k is faster and uses less power than 12700k so no new psu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i use 12400f and even with stream on youtube, playing game nd using discord i dont exceed cpu use above 60%, didn't knew that 9th gen i7 was that bad.",update it mate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have a 9900k running at 5.1. don't feel any slugginess at all, so i'm probably waiting for meteor lake (which requires a new platform) or zen4, even if i'm tempted to get a 13700k and a ddr4 mobo.","in short, no, your computer won't survive 5 years, but it's probably better to wait another year or two for a major upgrade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wasnt aware of that.,i did read the 13700k is going to be about $450.,which is fine.,"if i can reuse my ram and psu, that would be great, as i am only going to be able to put up to $1000 more on my pc before it comes down to skipping on meals lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
interesting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm not sure how much the lack of multithreading does for that cpu, only the heavier mt should be penalized.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why not consider a 13600k?,it will be at around $300 and will beat 12700k and maybe 12900k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wait for benches, it's not so sure that it will beat the 12700k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"fair enough, but believe me, it will.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not in every task.,cant wait to see real tests.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i really like these.,intel should make its own little gaming system.,that would really help optimize the gpus for games.,maybe try to make a deal with steam to be official hardware maker.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

turn off any ai overclock.,set xmp.,turn on svid.,set power limit to max permited.,set vccin to 2.1v.,"set vcore to adaptive, 0.001v total/additional voltage and auto or 0v offset.",then try to increase your core clock from there as much as your cooling system permits.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wait for the launch,  compare the prices, and then finally make the decision.",it's only a month.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel cpus historically do not get discounted that much when a new gen comes out.,"11600ks are still 200 dollars on newegg, 10700ks are still almost 300.

the only real discounts you get on these if they go on sale (temporary retailer sale, not an msrp price cut) or if you buy a used one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i don't know if you live within driving distance of one, but microcenter has been selling 12700k for $350 for over a year now, including right now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no prices are going to drop with the current inflation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
micro center currently has 12900k for $499 with $20mobo credit.,you might see another 50 or so drop with raptor lake.,i do not think raptor lake will be a monumental jump over the alder lake series for things like gaming.,intel usually does a 1-2-3 bang.,1 launch new socket huge gain in performance -  2. mid ship generational increase of 15\~20% 3. end of socket cycle.,bang\~ new socket chipset.,"raptor lake will launch at a premium, alder lake with take a 10% cut.","since they both utilize the same socket, and 790 chipsets really hasn't been benched or tested.",https://www.microcenter.com/product/641915/intel-core-i9-12900k-alder-lake-32ghz-sixteen-core-lga-1700-boxed-processor-heatsink-not-included,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">currently 12700k is still hanging around $400...

yeah... expect that price to be the norm for a long while as [intel confirmed price increases](https://www.pcworld.com/article/823871/intel-confirms-it-will-raise-prices-and-has-killed-optane.html) for all skus - including alder lake.","your best bet is to set price alerts for used 12700k/kf, but that may not be enough due to how well alder lake was designed/implemented and rumors that raptor lake won't widen the price-performance gap (plus zen 4 competition).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you...are you really buying 2x 4090?,damn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that makes the most sense.,they're having an event this tuesday right?,and expected launch is mid october assuming rumors are true so almost right around the same time as the 4090 anyways.,the only thing that'd make me antsy is if there's an amazing deal on the 12700k for like $250 or lower but i doubt that happens.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or bleeding edge users selling off their alderlake chips to make room for raptor lake.,you can get a good deal that way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"unfortunately i do not, hopefully they build one out my way.",is $350 a good price for the 12700k even with 13th gen on the horizon and the rumored prices?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"lol no, they are just using two monitors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
deals will come surely.,just like nvidia did to their 30 series.,"but if you get a good deal right now, grab that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""or if you buy a used one""

also, that's not intel giving discounts, which is what op asked.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ah makes sense.,one for each eye.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what kind of deals happened on 11th or 10th gen when 12th came out?,i donâ€™t recall anything much.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i know just giving my 2 cents.,"like you said major discounts shouldn't be expected from intel, so looking second hand seems more appropriate than waiting for a hand our from intel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i believe there will be some deals.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11900k was $260 recently on amazon but i guess that's a while after 12th gen came out..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
really looks and from your description sounds like a power pin shorted out another pin.,despite it still â€œworkingâ€ it could have damaged both cpu and motherboard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
return both.,probably will fail sooner than expected.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can you clean it off with 70%+ isopropyl alcohol?,how about showing us the socket?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is worrisome might wanna clean off the socket and make sure that its cleaned in there so it doesnâ€™t do get bad just in case,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"when you saw bent pin why did you put cpu without aligning pin first, very dumb move.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thats can impact any hardware like gpu or ram ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seller processor wont cover it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"but motherboard can covered, did you think if i put processor into new motherboard which is new socket too , it will fine or will break the pins again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
after i installed the processor the pin on motherboard just broken and looks like burnt too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i try playing game and render only cpu with blender its work fine , the temp 30-50â° its normall right ?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can you gave any advice for clean the socket and safe ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"did you think if i put processor into new motherboard which is new socket too , it will fine or will break the pins again?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it might.,i donâ€™t know what those pins are - if theyâ€™re just power or redundant it might not have any effect.,"but it could be a pcie pin (gpu or ssd), or one one the memory pins (possibly something you arenâ€™t currently using).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you drop something in the socket beforehand or was it a new board?,"if you bought it within the return window contact the place you bought from and tell them it doesnâ€™t work as expected, tell them what happened after you installed it and show them pictures.",i wouldnâ€™t use that kind of hardware because i wouldnâ€™t know if it will die randomly or burn my home down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well i donâ€™t know which pin does what.,it might work fine even with a few bent pins,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"honestly, if it's working, i wouldn't even go playing around in the socket; you risk damaging things even more.","typically you would use 99% alcohol and a q-tip, but in a socket, no way.","you said it runs well, cool, and does everything fine.","if that's the case, then just enjoy your system and don't think about it.","if you want, you can try to warranty it, maybe your motherboard manufacturer and or processor manufacturer will be forgiving; but if they say no, just enjoy your system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or any bad things will come future,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they have data for which pins work with hardware?,where can i see,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the warranty maybe bot covered accident like this.,but thanks anyway,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you wouldn't want a q-tip near your socket.,alcohol and a soft bristle toothbrush is the way to go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there are diagrams/schematics for that but i usually canâ€™t find them.,perhaps someone else can help you there.,"also, assuming you have already corrected the bad motherboard pin, i would say that any potential damage to other system components would have already happened.",but i would not use the system if the pin is still shorting anything out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so the only best solution is i should change only the motherboard or both of them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would probably want to know what those pins are to make a proper recommendation there.,"if theyâ€™re redundant power pins, i would fix the socket as best i can, clean those contacts on the cpu as much as i can with alcohol and a swab, and hope for the best.","if these were important pins, i would swap the motherboard for sure, clean the cpu, and see how it goes.","if this is a work pc where potential crashes would be an issue, i would want to replace both items for piece of mind regardless of anything else.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i jusy try to find the use of each pins but i couldn't find anything bout that.,if processor already broken why it still wokr fine and temp still normal.,i'm just worried it will get worse in the future.,which it will damage gpu or any expansive hardware.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"from the pinout i found, looks like a vcccore and vss (ground) pin shorted.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so its mean ?,fatal ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thats burnt on processor is left middle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

at my old job we had some intel product with packaging like this.,i ended up removing the part that makes the sound.,itâ€™s triggered when a light sensor detects light.,i put it in our mini fridge so it made that noise every time someone opened it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i scrambled to mute the stupid music... and then i realized.,(tiktok clips on reddit and yt have trained me),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
theyâ€™ve had this feature for nearly 10 years for the nuc packaging.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably required a processor to get that to work,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh that brings back memories.,"they used to put that sound chip on the bathroom door of my job so whenever anyone went in, the whole office knew.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the 12400 is locked to 4.0ghz all core.,"without bclk overclocking you will not see more than that, except for the max 1/2 core turbo speed of 4.4ghz.",i would assume an issue with however youâ€™re monitoring or determining speeds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you using hwinfo64 to monitor clocks?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 12700 maxes about 4.8ghz on most b660 boards in singlecore, 4.5ghz all core.",the k version can obviously be clocked higher.,"the non k will have worse ddr4 memory compatibility,  because of locked system agent voltage .","i don't know how much you need for 3600cl 16.

i wouldn't spend $170 more to get the k build of that particular processor (i have a 12700 non k).","especially at higher resolutions, the cpu performance differential is going to be minimal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that depends on how much you will overclock the 12700k, worse ones cant go past 4.9, best ones 5.3",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it makes sense to get 3600 ram regardless of build choices.,3600 isn't guaranteed in gear 1 with non k cpu though.,maybe imc maxes at ~3550.,personally i'd get the second choice.,the only issue is you'll need better cooling as well.,"i'd also get bdie and go for 4000mt ram overclock at cl14 or 15.

more ram speed and lower latency means better 1% and .1%, more cpu mhz means better 1% and .1%, and finally higher cpu cache (ring) ratio means better 1% and .1% as it all contributes to more memory bandwidth.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i would still get the better ram, and simply tighten the timings at whatever the ram ultimately runs at.","ddr4 can get down into the 40ns latency zone easily with even lowish clocks (at cl13), which is good for minimum fps in most games.",the only unknown is how the locked voltage handles the tighter timings.,"i use ddr5 to avoid this issue all together, at the cost of higher latency.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the artic liquid freezer ii 280 (speaking from experience) is enough for both processors.,"i would plan to get a thermal anti bending frame, because artic cold plates are very, very flat, which the stock cpu frame doesn't deal well with.",but it's not a necessity (still it's 6$).,"the locked k barely goes over 150w even using avx512 in rpcs3, which is probably the most intense thing a gamer will ever do with that particular processor.","and you have to jump through hoops to use avx512, so most people will never see that kind of power draw.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the ipc gains alone going from 9th gen to 12th gen would be significant enough to justify an upgrade, even for gaming.....you're talking %15-%25 range depending on game.",that can translate into some decent fps gains which could help if you run higher hz monitors and you are trying to up your fps averages.,i went from 10850k to 12900k and noticed.,from a multitasking stand point and productivity standpoint i could tell it was much snappier and faster in the applications i use daily for personal and work from home purposes.,i'd say it all boils down to personal preference and what you are willing to spend.,"for me, it was a worthy upgrade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yea i was wondering the same thing.,i am too on the 9900k but with the 3090ti.,maybe there would be improvements with the 1% low and 0.1% low in gaming; but overall not worth the upgrade unless you are a tech nerd.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this!,"i went with teamgroup  cl14 b-die at 7.4ns on a 12900k and this thing is rock solid, 29k cinebench scores all day long.",the m/t rate does not make up for the massive timings on current ddr5 modules unfortunately.,people should also note that they think the 12900k runs at 100c constant.,this chip hardly breaks 45c for 99% of the task an average user is going to perform.,even in games.,when you go tits out all core benchmarking anything that draws \~240w is going dissipate a shit load of heat.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"seems like your convinced yourself, which is fine

but ddr4 will be dead in a year or two

its not frequency that will mature but probably timings, in which case you will need to buy a new mobo to be able to use that ram, so youâ€™ll be stuck on ddr4 until you upgrade your cpu

besides, the memory controller is on the cpu anyway, and you have an upgrade path to the 13900k if you choose that as well",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i just noticed that z790 will be coming in like 3 days.,i might just wait and buy a z790 to feel more secture about better future support.,"&#x200b;

i doubt i will be upgrading my cpu in the next 5 years and my main concern is gaming, for other applications i can make comprosies and with such a cpu they won't be big",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah smart choice, like buying a mobo with ddr5 will just allow you to upgrade the ram when better dimms come out in the future lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, my main concern with z690 mobos is that they might not support the highest speeds that come with ddr5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends highly on usage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you need more storage?,if not i would just upgrade the ram bc its cheap and easy(usually).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i use it for daily stuff and for learning cybersecurity

i need to use virtual box, windows and linux",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah i agree, its cheaper that way

i also think i will need to upgrade the storage, 128gb does not seem enough for linux and virtual box both",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how many cores?,how many virtual boxes do you need concurrently?,edit: most probably you have two cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes 2 cores
concurrently, i need the base machine and one virtual machine
in some rare cases 2 virtual machines together.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"let me put it this way: 
in your setup, one vm is possible.",i doubt it will be fun.,two vms is out of question.,try a vm with a super minimal linux (minimal or no  gui) and see if you can live with that processing wise.,e. g. browsing on main while vm doing something it is supposed to do (possibly in conjunction with something on main).,your problem is investments in ram and maybe even ssd are a waste once you can't stand the way the system responds to input.,i gave up on windows & ubuntu on a two core without vms.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah true
one vm works but not very fun, and if that vm is windows then it is more difficult
dual boot will not totally solve the problem as vms will be required for practising

so better buy new one than investing on ram and storage..?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, but donâ€™t get the hyper 212. the id cooling se 214 performs the same and is half the price",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes definitely.,"that is a 65w non k cpu, it will not run hot and the 212 will be more than sufficient.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what do you think about hyper tx3 evo?,thanks alot for the answer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that would be fine too.,itâ€™s still better than the stock cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you can get it free, sure.",just make sure itâ€™s not a too good to be true situation though.,"(scam, defectiveâ€¦etc.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for 100% free?,"yeah, why not.","for any, even a slight fee?",no.,thatâ€™s about it.,"nothing more to add, 11900k is not a good product, but any bad product can become good if priced accordingly :d",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
youâ€™re gaining pci-e 4 and 20 lanes to the cpu with 11900k.,so itâ€™s a massive improvement for nvme pci-e ssdâ€™s but itâ€™s a power hungry cpu and hitting the higher boost clocks per core will draw more voltage and need adequate cooling.,i think some moboâ€™s also dramatically improved their chipsets from 490 to 590 but that is specific to certain boards and versions.,the ram also can bump up to 3200 and overclocking past that can be a little better.,"the memory bandwidth to the cpu is also higher, but not a lot-at 50gb/s.",as people point out for gaming you may not notice much gain but other workflows could.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"free yes, still... if you plan on installing that 11900k in a z490 you're wasting it's (very slight) potential.","i'd still say, stay with the 10900k on it's current platform...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"slightly better, so why not",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if it is free then yea why not.,"it has two fewer cores, but a faster different microarchitecture (sunny cove derivative vs skylake derivative).",some games will like the higher core count and some will prefer the higher ipc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
absolutely.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean is my i7-11700k bad if i payed only 194.99 for it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for free, sure, but 10900k can be faster in some instances.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"10900k, 13900k coming soon btw <3 i kept my 10900k and didn't get 11900k because i wanted more cores not less, didn't have any issues with my pcie or anything and lanes was never an issue but that 10900k overclocked like a fkn dream.","12900k gonna dip hard soon with 13900k arrival right before 4090 pops, honestly i'd snag that, ill be switching from 12900k to 13900k for sure man",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if it's free, why not?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on the game if you get a perf boost.,"you'll also have to deal with the awful power consumption,  but you gain avx-512 yay.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for gaming you can switch to 11900k but you won't get a huge uplift in terms of performance.,it will be 2-4% uplift.,"therefore, in other terms of work load like render, etc., you should stick with 10900k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for the same price, 11900k.","it is two less cores, but they're faster cores which benefits gaming.","just wondering, why are you going with 10th or 11th gen when 12th gen is so much better (by a lot!)?",price?,i'd go with 12600k over an 11900k without question.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"nope, hold the 10900k, itâ€™s still a great cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had a 10850k and built an additional 11900k system with 30 series cards and can 100 percent tell you it is not worth the upgrade.,even if it's free the performance difference will be negligible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd stick with the 10900k.,"it runs cooler, offers a few more cores and draws less power.","the 11th generation i9 is a very hard sell, even when it is free.",i doubt if you see any meaningful improvement by switching.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yes, you'll get a slight performance boost and way more future proofness with pcie gen 4. also improved stability over 10900k due to rocket lake not having ringbus issues",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looks like they are roughly about equal performance wise.,maybe roughly a 2% performance advantage in/with the i9-11900k.,"looks like swapping to i9-10900k would be a very slight downgrade in performance oddly enough, but your choice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11900k for gaming.,"however, 11th gen silicon quality is garbage and takes very high voltage for its clock if ur 10900k is a good clocker u may be able to get more speed out of it than even the 11900k",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

don't buy an arc gpu ffs.,intel missed the boat.,"these gpus are still janky, and they don't really offer a compelling value proposition compared to the existing amd and nvidia offerings, and amd and nvidia are in the process of releasing their next gen gpus that will deliver even better price/performance options.",couple that with a used market that is seeing prices get crushed by a flood of used mining cards and unsold 30 series new stock.,"arc is going to be dead soon, the writing is on the wall.","they didn't get alchemist out soon enough, and it's likely to be the same issue **if** they decide to do an actual release of battlemage.","i suspect battlemage won't be released as a mainstream discrete graphics card, i think intel will quietly smother the whole arc project and you'll be left with orphaned hardware that receives next to no support from either intel or game developers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah well intel has a big choice ahead of them.,give people a great deal in exchange for basically being a tester.,or give people an equivalent value to the competition and become irrelevant in the gpu sector.,if intel goes with the first one they can scrape all the budget oriented gamers and pc's market share away from amd and nvidia (although nvidia doesn't seem to even care about that segment anymore),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

most overall general use of a system is where single threaded performance is best.,multi threaded performance scores only really useful if you're pushing the limits of all your cores for heavy compute tasks like rendering or compression.,all you really need in a system is enough performance that you feel it's keeping up with what you're using it for.,storage performance is often what really holds things back the most,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

really depends on what exactly youre doing with the pc.,for excel sheets and internet browsing this thing is totally good.,for older games this cpu will do just fine too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what's the process for undervolting a laptop?,i would love to do it to mine.,"i've got an hp pavilion power, 7700hq, 32gb 2400mhz ram, 1050m, mushkin pilot-e nvme, 1080p display.",it still performs great for a 5 year old laptop.,i've got a gaming pc now again but before i did i was playing witcher 3 at about 50fps on medium on it.,"now it's just a backup for work but the battery life is awful, i can barely get 3 hours on battery saver and only watching netflix.","not even 1h doing work, and i'm not even going to try while playing games.","temps are crazy though, i redid the paste last week and they still reach like 85c, not even gaming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why'd you downgrade?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my laptop has a 2410m so yeah not really necessary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"considering that your cpu is only 20% than the cpu i use to game every single day, you will most likely be fine, depending on your need.","now yes, you will get better battery life out of a newer processor, but that wouldnâ€™t be a reason to upgrade for me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what pressure to upgrade?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
quad cores are still relevant for majority of the laptop market.,lots of business selling laptops like these in bulk you can buy for extremely cheap.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh hey, i got the same cpu with a 1050 in a laptop!","undervolting did wonders, now cpu only reaches as high as around 80, while gpu sits at around 60 while gaming",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah it's pretty slow but if that's enough for you it's all that matters, right?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
anything with at least 4 cores and 8 threads does well even now.. however 4 threads are too little.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is no pressure to upgrade.,i upgrade tech when it no longer works for what i want it to do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nowadays i take upgrades based on technical reasons rather than marketing ones.,"i used to get that fomo feeling, but since i realized the performance leap isn't that much of thing when you change hardware between a short amount of time (1 year-ish), mainly when you went for the enthusiast tier the last time you bought something, my builds usually have a 5 year life or more.","and usually after 5 or 7 years without an upgrade that didn't happened because of a maintenance, not only you've saved enough for a decent build but also almost no choices for high end or enthusiastic tiers are wrong: any good brand will grant you an awesome performance leap and longevity to your investment.","and you also had plenty of time to research and follow news and discussions about the new hardware, either already available or to be released.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
every time ive upgraded it was because the hinges failed and or i wanted a new tech that requires a newer processor like hardware hevc decoding and encoding.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you donâ€™t think â€œi wish this were fasterâ€ several times a day, why upgrade?",iâ€™m still on an i7-6700k and hardly ever think â€œthis is slowâ€.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you can do everything you want to do on your laptop, then don't upgrade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
undervolting and underclocking.,"my old laptop with an i7 4720hq + gtx 950m
i would lock the cpu clock slightly above base clock while playing games.","it was the difference between locked 60 fps on some aaa games, vs constant deep to 10 fps after 5 minutes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you mean upgraded to a laptop?,"the laptop you bought is super close to the desktop version of the same hardware, but your computer is mobile now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how are you undervolting that?,i can't in my asus laptop since the plundervolt update,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

any 5500u ryzen 5 will just stomp over that and it'll cost 500 bucks.,"8300h is basically a 6000 series chip overclocked, 2015 era.",getting long in the tooth really.,do you feel it?,"yeah, you feel it.",i had a 6700hq and moved to a 4800h.,something else entirely.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nowadays' processors are pretty efficient.,"the problem with laptops is if you have to use it on a stressful, continuous workload, mostly due to heat they will throttle.","as for pressure, i don't know, just use something until it no longer fits your needs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it depends on what's your use.,"some stuff i was able to do on a 10 year old dell latitude e4310, but some other stuff i needed either my pavilion gaming 15 (r7 4800h/16gb ram/1650ti) or my desktop (3 screens, r7 3700x, 32gb ram/1660ti).","it's not about the pressure to upgrade, but rather if that upgrade can help you do your work better!",also undervolting is a must now.,a buddy of mine bought this summer an used laptop with an i7 7700hq and had to undervolt that sucker to -120mv in order to stop it being a furnace.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
question can i undervolt a macbook pro on macos mojave (intel one from early 2013),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the pressure to upgrade really depends on what you use your laptop for.,some applications just work a lot better with modern chips.,i must admit that the floor of processor power in the mobile market progresses so quickly that i cannot imagine not upgrading every few years.,"a top end 10th or 11th gen i7 is basically a slower, more power hungry r5 5000 or 6000 series chip.","meanwhile, a i5 12th gen intel wipes the floor with almost every 10th and 11th gen mobile chip.","by the same time next year, the i3 13th gen or r3 equivalent is going to run circles around most i5 and r5 equivalents.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"depends on what you need the cpu for, i put my old gpu into an i5 build and gave it to my best buddy, he no longer wants a ps5 or xbox x, satisfied with everything on ultra at 2k, rocket lake with 16gb ram and my old rtx 3060 eagle non oc",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what gpu do you have?,i used to have a i5 7300hq + 1050 laptop.,"the 1050 clocked quite well, easily hitting 1924mhz + 829mhz on vram quite easily with no undervolt applied.",the i5 7300hq ate 20w to maintain 3.1ghz.,i then upgraded to a i5 10300h + gtx 1650 laptop for $310 just a month ago.,it was necessary to undervolt.,however i had to do some bios trickery to unlock undervolting.,got it to stay at 4ghz but ran a bit hot at 85 degrees.,this is after a thermal repaste and undervolted gpu.,intel is scum for blocking undervolting.,and a scum for expecting us to pay more just to have that feature.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"hi, can you specify how to undervolt it?",thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm quite sad my 11th gen u series doesn't undervolt, but from what i've noticed, it's power efficient enough.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"true, and they downclock like crazy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"with fsr, dying light 2 runs just fine, but it is not that cpu intensive",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intel xtu is the easiest way but doesnt always work.,"throttlestop is much better, look up for guides.","many higher power parts will take -100mv or more quite easily, u cant undervolt anything with new bios or is newer than 8th gen because of a security flaw (google plundervolt).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, and 12th gen desktop atleast will sometimes do some shadowey clock stretching if you go to far instead of just crashing.",so you need to also monitor performance than just stability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

happy cake day!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it was due to plundervolt but it's such a aggresive lockdown that i have a feeling their doing it on purpose so people buy new stuff.,they're going way too far.,like blocking stuff through custom code designed for specific laptop versions far.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very nice!,my old 1050 hit +240mhz on core and +829mhz on vram.,shit was insane.,definitely a god tier bin on that one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah.,i do not like messing with the bios much.,but i will try once again.,i did seem to find a article where they mentioned stuff like uninstalling system firmware fron device manager?,that somehow stops it for upgrading the bios.,"one time it randomly started updating my bios (not when i was downgrading it, randomly while working).",and it ended up bricking my laptop.,luckily the repair wasn't much.,"but it's annoying as shit

at least get a cheap tower cooler.. i have the cm hyper h410r with a 12400f.. temps barely hits 65â°c before reducing to the 50s and stays in the 50s mostly during gaming.,or make sure your cpu power isn't unlocked.,if you have an msi motherboard you can change the cooler configuration to box cooler in the bios and you may be fine.,if you have some other motherboard brand make sure the power limits are locked to 65w.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"as someone who stupidly jumped on the x299 bandwagon, i can easily say iâ€™d rather have a more efficient cpu that doesnâ€™t get my fans turning like a turbojet.","hedt my ass, more like a backup heat pump for the house.",it may also be that efficiencies gained in desktop chips will eventually lead to more efficient chips in laptops (which trail behind a step or two).,and nobody really wants a lap-heater.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's more that the raw heat output can be a problem in the summer but that's only a real problem on the top end.,if you get a 500w gpu with a 300w cpu that's ~900w of heat in your room if you count psu inefficiency which is a lot.,for people running mid range systems it realistically doesn't matter at all.,"on desktop it's just marketing, if they can't advertise higher performance they will lower clocks and voltage a bit then advertise they have the best efficiency even though it doesn't mean much.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

all the comments are really just sugarcoating.,when the difference in power consumption between competing products is usually 50w or less (which is usually the case today) itâ€™s completely meaningless and thereâ€™s literally no reason to care about this.,the only reason people make a fuss over it is because they are fanboys for a particular company and are trying to argue for their products with a metric thatâ€™s meaningless in the context of their competition.,hope this helps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

they dont, as far as i know not many people even know or bother to read up on how much power the pc they are looking at draws.",only people that actually are not interested would be complaining about the power draw.,for instance if you look into those peoples history on a hw forum you will easily spot that they are leaning towards something else from the start.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
on point #1 thatâ€™s only if you have it going 24/7 365. computers are usually off at night and go into low power modes when you arenâ€™t using them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
x299 cpus were still based on skylake and so had similar efficiency.,"if you bought a 6 core skylake-x you got something similar to an 8700k in power, just one year early.","(exception is if you were doing scientific work with avx, but in that case you got a much faster cpu)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"skylake-x alone was already really not a good product efficiency-/price-wise and consumers felt shafted a lot, though the real underdog were the little skylake-x cpus on x299.",intel basically scammed people with that.,my condolences to everyone who felt for the trap and got it cheap with a deal.,"skl-x was a shameful chapter, especially the last revision, when intel halved the prices to counter threadripper.",overpriced heaters.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"most likely motherboard settings, as you upgraded your motherboard as well as your cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
technically the 10400 uses a lot more power under load than the 9400. one review shows 125w vs 96w.,but i think a lot of your other system components changed that could account for your current observations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i've reconnected and remounted it several times.,today i'm going to the store to buy the same model to see if it gives the same issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yep, one going into the the aio_pump header and the other connects to the aio fans and to the psu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

perhaps yes.,tho it would be nice to have it as a preorder.,"after aaallllll this communication with intel and their support adventure time, i don't want anything else.",just the time to pass and got the key and never deal with them again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

did you check that you have the right bios version to run kaby-lake cpu's?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most likely a laptop firmware related glitch.,"but seriously, switch to hwinfo and ditch that mess which is hwmonitor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

in that case it was probably misreported.,"did you also see the memory speed when the bclk was higher, as it should have scaled too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it doesn't display that stuff.,"it's clock speed, bus speed, cpu temps, cpu wattage, the load on the ram or memory, temps and used space of drive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the thing that migh make this system to run at higher mem speeds than normally is that this is an 2dimm board after all.","heard that ivan from framechasers could run his 12100 at 3733mhz on the imc, in that case if the cpu i use is about as good as his then it would still have still a way to go, as i am on 1650 right now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they're basically the same thing but the i7 has slightly higher boost clocks.,imo the difference between them is likely smaller than the difference in sustained performance between different laptops having the same processor.,"if performance is important, get a device with the cooling needed to maintain boost clocks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i chose the i5-1240p over the i7 variants because it was several hundet euros cheaper and is not a lot slower.,mobile devices suffer more from a lack of hardware acceleration support than cpu power.,so the i7 would be just as obsolete then.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the difference in performance between 1165, 1135 and future cpus from say 2025 will be *a lot* large than the difference between 1165 and 1135. future cpus from say 2025 will leave both 1165, 1135 and possibly even 12th generation ones in the dust and it would barely matter whether you have a 1135 or 1165

the only time 1165 is preferred over 1135 is if laptop maker is not charging ridiculous amount of money for this upgrade [you decide how much amount of money is ridiculous]

12th generation is highly recommended over either and something like 1240p will be *way* better than 1135 or 1165",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'd say with those two processors, the i7 is worth it.",mostly because its in a mobile device so upgrading isn't as easy as swapping cpu's.,i have an i5 12600k in my desktop and i think for 95% of people that is plenty for the next few years unless you have applications where more cores is helpful like editing or rendering.,but for your case the i7 is def worth it imo :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"they're almost identical, so i would go for the i5 because the price hike isn't worth the tiny bit more performance, but tbh for laptop i would go for like a ryzen 5 5500u which you usually can get for about the same price and it has 30% more performance (or a 5600u which has 50% more performance than either the i5 or i7) performance source bellow

unfortunately 12th gen intel is not available here.,it is how every thing is.,11th gen destroys my i5 5200u.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
desktop is so different.,there are laptops where a 1235g7 is as fast or even faster than a 1165g7 simply because of thermal restrictions (1165 throttles harder).,"or you have a laptop with better cooling design and a 1135 can turbo boost higher and for longer than a laptop with a lesser design but a 1165.

this has been proven many times by reviewers.",also applicable to 1240 vs 1260 for example.,it is never worth it on laptops.,"by the time any of these gets obsolete, both are obsolete.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my current laptop is 5 years old and it is really slow.,"i wish i had a small more processing power in my current device, so the edge would run smoother and not crashing(lol).",and as you mentioned yes; laptop's cpu can't be swapped with another.,i appreciate your opinion.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if i recall correctly it allows the processor to access wider/resizable blocks of vram.,"instead of the legacy 256mb, the processor can sift through vram in larger chunks.",as cards come with more and more vram it can boost performance as the system is not waiting on cpu to find the items in vram it wants,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

probably more has to do with the added usb power draw triggering some kind of efficiency limitation?,how about a usb hub with an external power adapter?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't think i have any powered hubs to try but whether the power draw is really small (like an empty usb hub) or really high (like a phone getting a fast charge) is this really the intended functionality of speed shift?,i'm guessing it's actually just some issue caused by dell with this specific latitude model but i'm curious to learn more about it.,"i've not been able to find much documentation and there don't seem to be any configuration settings for it, just a single on/off switch in the bios.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i tried a usb 3.0 hub with an external power supply and it didn't show the problem.,then i went back to my other hubs and my phone and they didn't show the problem either!,i know for sure toggling speed shift in the bios had an effect before but maybe something else changed on my system.,i'll edit my original post.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, i really donâ€™t think the two should be in any way connected.","from what iâ€™ve read, speed shift allows the cpu itself to dynamically shift its frequency between minimum and maximum instead of relying on slower commands to come from the operating system.","> with speed shift enabled, cpu takes over the responsibility of frequency control, which will be done on a hardware level by the cpu itself, thisâ€™ll allow much faster p-state transitions and can drastically reduce latency during the process of p-state selection.","https://coderbag.com/product/quickcpu/features/hwp/intel-speed-shift-performance-settings

you aio is broken but that doesn't mean your cpu is faulty.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you have a gpu right?,you might want to upgrade that before thinking about upgrading you cpu.,(i know this is the intel subreddit but i would recommend amd over intel.),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it was broken ... i allready replaced the cooler still my cpu is running at an incredible low performance despite being on max 60â°c and still im not looking for the best thing i could do with selling everything since that would just too time consuming.,i just wanted to know what matches my motherboard the best at the time right now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as i said for the third time : i want to exchange my cpu since its my bottleneck right now .,if i cant use my pc normally outside of games bec of it performing low what does a gpu upgrade bring to the table?,like no one did respond once with actually telling me what the best cpu would be for that motherboard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if it's running it's not broken.,"cpus don't get slower, they fail to do computation when broken.",you have some other problem than the cpu.,if you buy a new cpu without solving that problem nothing will change.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not sure what to say to convince you but all cpus since early 2000's have dynamic frequency scaling that is used to throttle the cpu frequency so that it would operate at a safe range.,this is used today as well for the turbo frequencies.,"so you cannot ""burn"" a cpu even without a cooler unless you had a overclocking profile that could prevent the cpu from automatically using the dynamic frequency scaling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
has it occurred that your board is what's holding back your cpu and not the other way around?,that board is infamously bad.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

screw the seals.,scammers know how to make it seem like they havenâ€™t been inside a box.,"in fact, thatâ€™s the whole key to the scam: attention isnt given to sealed boxes, but it is on opened boxes!","but **every intel cpu package has a clear window in the box** (well, except for certain specially packaged i9 models) where you can literally see the physical cpu and its markings.","**when the cpu is backwards (contact pads visible), does not seem to have any markings (sanded down), is not visible at all through the window (â€œcame loose in shippingâ€), or has some kind of intel sticker placed on top, that box has almost assuredly been opened and the cpu replaced with a worthless one.","**

examples of how the boxes should look, for 10th, 11th and 12th gen:

this is far from the first time this exact issue has been reported in this group since i started frequenting.",be proactive: do not buy a boxed intel cpu that you canâ€™t read the marking on.,"if someone like best buy really wants to sell you one where you canâ€™t verify, make them open the box on the spot and prove itâ€™s the right cpu, so you donâ€™t get screwed later.",the cpu is in a plastic holder and wonâ€™t be damaged.,"(yes, cpus can be sanded and remarked convincingly as well, but thatâ€™s not how this scam typically goes, and even if it does, returns shouldnâ€™t be an issue.)",i have no sympathy for best buy.,"if they donâ€™t care enough to check for this issue on returns, then itâ€™s their own fault.","but them not doing their part and putting these kinds of returns into general inventory only screws over honest customers who buy these scammed cpus as new, try to legitimately return them, and subsequently get denied as if they were the ones doing the scamming.",thatâ€™s not cool.,"and yes, iâ€™m sure people do try to scam in this same way too - but you canâ€™t assume everyone is guilty when you donâ€™t manage your inventory competently in the first place.","itâ€™s tougher when you get shipped a scammed cpuâ€¦ but again, donâ€™t open anything you canâ€™t obviously verify.",just send it back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
common scam where someone replaces the cpu and reseals the package.,"whoever handles the returns checks if product is unopened, not if it's the right item.",(this could probably be solved by switching to plastic bubble/blister packs to hold the cpu.),people have reported it with amd cpus as well.,this is pretty common on amazon from what i understand.,various shops/stores share inventory and the returns get mixed in with the supply.,it probably only happens with high-end cpus so anyone buying cheaper models are probably safe.,"if you're having problems with best buy, i suppose you could do a credit card chargeback.","this is their problem, not yours.",i suppose you could also email intel to complain and they might come down on their retailers since it makes intel look bad.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i almost feel bad for these megacorps for getting scammed this way lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"there was once planned a cpu based on ocean cove which would be on lga1700, which was basically golden cove shrunk to intel 4, but early on intel 4 wasn't expected to reach the clocks necessary to prevent a performance regression when compared to alder lake.","because of how much lead time you need to produce these cpus, the decision was made about 2 years ago to instead do raptor lake which is basically a refined version of golden cove with some extra cache as a hold over.","as of the last hot chips presentation, however, it seems like intel 4 performance has improved dramatically (with some help with foveros allowing for new capacitor array in the base tile).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i don't see anything wrong with a mid-cycle upgrade while they wait for meteor lake to be ready.,they've done it before.,the important thing is intel has to release *something* new every year and rebrand/refresh the entire lineup to give oems something new to sell on their annual cadence.,11th gen was an architecture change from 10th gen on desktop - mostly for the worse.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

> intel's 11th generation of desktop cpus was a bad joke that shouldn't have been released.,"yeah, it's a shame we didn't get tigerlake on desktop instead.","but intel, like the rest of the world, thought 10nm++ wouldn't be able to do well enough for desktop.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't know which one you're claiming is which.,12nm zen+ is the same die dimensions as original zen.,"it just had microcode tuning, on just a very slightly improved node that was originally called 14nm+, before glofo's marketing department decided to rebrand it.",same way intel added another+ onto their node.,"there is nothing fundamentally different about zen+ from first gen. microcode tuning, and frequency bumps could be found as much on coffee lake as zen+.",amd's marketing department is just better at convincing people otherwise it seems.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"thatâ€™s not intel, thatâ€™s some dude on twitter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

me too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that cpu is significantly weaker than your old i3 and pretty much from the same generation anyways.,why not just fix your old pc and get a gpu capable of 8k output when you need it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that would be sufficient for some single use machine like a cash register.,i would not use that as every day computer.,"also that might be a ""barebones"" system you need to buy ram and storage for.","and i don't think the gpu supports 8k output, for that you need the latest generation igpu.","for normal web browsing, office and media use you want at least four threads on the cpu.",something like pentium gold g7400 would do it but building a full desktop would be significantly more expensive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"geekbench 5 scores:
- j4005: 377/649

definitely not with that one.,that one has a cpu slower than your current pc.,the celeron in it is a bottom barrel chip from 2017. the igpu in it is accordingly outdated as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
too late for that.,i have sold it.,but i must mention one point my old i3 was struggling to play even 4k videos on youtube.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can you please visit amazon.in (not .com) and give the link of a nuc which is capable of playing 8k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

in 2-3 years intel will have 1 card specifically they say is for gaming and then theyâ€™ll focus on â€œacceleratorsâ€ down the line-dual purpose cards that will drive your display but possibly also capture input and/or accelerate encoding with next gen codecs.,thereâ€™s significant hope in the streaming and broadcast markets that intel may have struck gold with their platform regarding encode/decode/transcode workflows and i guarantee youâ€™ll see them entering this space in a targeted way with multi-linked cards.,to do that effectively theyâ€™ll have to keep cards at under $400 always.,intel may not become a huge player in the gaming market but they can disrupt other sectors which is a good thing still.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
getting ready for retail..... amazing empty words.,we've heard soon for months now.,"at this point who cares, nvidia has a concrete announcement today.",amd has a concrete announcement november 3rd.,intel can't even give a launch quarter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
even at 200 it wouldn't make any sense.,intel is way too late to the party.,especially when you see brand new rx6600 regularly dropping to 199.  just imagining the hours of troubleshooting that one could save by skipping this gen of intel dgpu it's mine boggling.,i'm nowhere near as well equipped as gamers nexus to handle buggy drivers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
who cares?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't think it makes much sense for it to be priced the same as a 6600 xt/6650 xt when performance will suffer so severely in older games.,"tier 3 pricing, right?",if it truly was the case then it ought to be $250 or lower.,but will that happen?,doubt it.,"regardless, i think we all should hope for better than the bare minimum, because it's just too cynical not to.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the pictures?,inb4 intel sells gpu nfts due to poor yields and intransigent driver issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
even that's too much tbh.,i think if they realistically want them to sell they have to be like $200.,they have to stay a pricing tier below 6600xt and 3060 to be competitive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hear hear!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what are you even on about.,also the reason why people went for macs despite the performance was the software.,no one's going to be buying an intel gpu for the software besides av1...which since they took so long to release that nvidia's new gpus are already getting av1 next month.,drivers are literally the worst part about arc gpus.,"don't bother me with the fine wine saying either, tech gets superseded faster than the software can mature.",nvidia will still dominate in the workstation/server space too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the only time v/f offset to a negative value will not work is when you are already at the very bottom (minimum) of the voltage tables.",the v/f points are your cpu's voltage tables.,and those values indicate the minimum voltage values if you were to set both the ac load line and the dc load line values to 0.01mohms.,"or if you have asus svid options available, setting to best case also sets ac ll & dc ll = 0.01mohms.",this is the lowest voltage that you can go.,"so it is the ""best case"" svid.",that would be my only thought to why the newer bios is not allowing you to go lower.,it could have updated your svid to best case already.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is where i first read about the options and what they do.",vf is very tweak friendly.,but there are other easier ways to achieve the kind of voltage versus frequency curve that you want without having to tweak every point.,you do that just by adjusting what svid adjusts in the background.,asus's svid just adjusts two options in the background.,it adjusts the ac and the dc load line values.,it keeps them the same.,i dunno the values for z690 boards.,but for my z490 these were the values.,"b

||best case|typical case|worse case|intel fail safe|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|ac/dc ll|0.01 mohm|0.60 mohm|0.90 mohm|1.1 mohm|

and for the over clocker, you can pretty much fine tune your cpu between the 0.01 mohm to 0.60 mohm range.",i suggest steps of (+/-) 0.10 mohm.,so 0.50 mohm to 0.40 mohm .... 0.10 mohm.,with 0.01 mohm being the absolute lowest voltages.,and 1.1 mohm being well.... intel fail safe so high voltage.,they use 1.1 mohm because some users use a demanding load such as avx2 and load the cpu up to 100% load.,so it requires the power.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the most ""pc"" thing i've heard him talk about is *monitors*.",he couldn't tell you if a 6600 or a 3080 was the better gpu.,dude doesn't play computer games or deal in the pc/component/windows world.,"which is fine, thats just not his wheelhouse.","after listening to his internal struggle earlier this year over throwing away his couple-year-old $40k xeon mac pro for a $6k glorified mac mini, seeing him pimp an intel gpu of all things is really quite an ironic combination.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thanks my bad i meant without the m,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nvidia isn't releasing anything remotely midrange until next year.,the arc series was never going to compete in the same market as the -80 or higher cards anyway.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it doesn't exceed the competition in tier 1  games in the slightest.,it's less bad than than in other games.,a 400mm^2 a770 being on par with a 390mm^2 on a half as dense node in it's best case is terrible.,it's using twice the effective die area (tmsc 6nm is dramatically denser than 8nm samung).,at it's best in tier 1 games it's vastly underperforming because it's matching an entire segment lower than amd and nvidia are competing in.,"that is a 400mm^2 6nm card should be competing with amd and nvidia's best, not their midrange cards.",in the non new titles the cards are even worse.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this might not be necessarily true.,there are some people that have lots of subs but are worse at efficiently running their business.,i think it was quite a while before pewdiepie got an editor for his videos which imo wasn't the best way to run that channel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what they do?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have no idea other than the few benchmarks we've seen so far.,the df xess looks great already!,i'm just on the positive side of this release as xess is open source and we now have a 3rd gpu designer in the game.,this will keep the industry pricing in check.,nvidia is very dominant in gpu gaming.,almost a monopoly pretty much.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i agree, linus media group seem yo have done an amazing job optimizing for sponsorships",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"xess isn't really open source, it apaprently runs a different version on intel hardware and on all other hardware akin to nvidia running physx with serious acceleration on their own hardware but running non optimised cpu code for amd which meant it was excessively catered to one company and ended up being pushed when paid by nvidia but died in the end as it wouldn't get universal uptake.",anything being pushed which runs code path a for one company and code path b for competitors is always going to have codepath b be less optimised and so creates a massive issue in terms of integrity.,"but again from the few benchmarks we've seen a a770 or 750 was pretty much on par wiht a 3060 ot 3060ti in those tier 1 games where it's running peak, even ahead a few times, but in all those other tier games it was anything from a bit to significantly behind.",this is intel's top tier die and it's big and expensive and on average it's losing out pretty badly to nvidia and amd last gen midrange which is all about to be replaced on a significantly better node.,in other words a770 is going to come out way behind the new amd/nvidia midrange cards.,the a770 matching a 3070(to be generous) is akin to if the 6900xt came out and was 'competitive' with the 3070 as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the operating system performs scheduling of threads, which is a purely software function.","each os has different strategies, can these can often be reconfigured for different applications (e.g.",a server might have different scheduling priorities than a laptop).,the thread director is a bunch of performance counters that the os can read to understand how efficiently different threads are running.,it can then in theory use this information to help scheduling decisions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thread director does literally none of the things you've mentioned.,the os scheduler (windows/linux) does everything you have listed in software long before the advent of thread director.,"thread director can't swap anything, it's merely a source of new information that the operating system ***might*** use.",windows uses a concept of [priority](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/procthread/scheduling-priorities) which has been in place for decades and the highest priority threads run.,but ever since 2017 in windows 10 they have used [quality of service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/procthread/quality-of-service) as means of determining performance/power tradeoffs (for example e/p core scheduling).,all of this works on windows 10 and hence 12th gen runs mostly fine there.,arm chips have had big and little cores for a very long time after all.,sadly it's not sufficiently documented how thread director actually influences anything in windows.,"according to intel's hotchips explanation, the hardware provides feedback (information) to classify threads - ultimately most of what you do is 1 class, and rarer ""emerging applications"" (intels own term) that use avx instructions are classes 2&3.","so if you had an avx heavy workload (rare), threaddirector could tell the os that those threads are better suited for p-cores versus mainstream apps.","the os may or may not use that information in a way it sees fit, likely in combination with the above 2 concepts i listed above.","so unless you have a complex workload with a mix of work, some of which is avx heavy... it can't do anything.","anandtech's [hotchips](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16901/hot-chips-2021-day-1-section-1-cpus-alder-lake-zen3-ibm-z-sapphire-rapids) write-up has more info, but prioritizing avx is the tech in a nutshell.",this is why all the reviews don't show a difference between win10 and win11.,the vast majority of benchmarks people run are homogenous instruction mixes.,for example cinebench runs the same types of calculations on all threads at the same time.,theres no difference and thus no preference in scheduling for p-cores.,also avx isn't that common for consumer workloads.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
from what i have experienced/observed a new workload is started up with the p-cores before then sent to the e-cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you want to know more about the thread director, the documentation is here:  

https://www.intel.com/content/dam/develop/public/us/en/documents/325384-sdm-vol-3abcd.pdf

see ""14.6 hardware feedback interface and intelâ® thread director"".","table 14-6, ""hardware feedback interface logical processor entry structure"" shows the counters, which are 1 byte per logical processor describing how efficiently the processor is running, and another describing how fast it is running.",if the os sees that a thread is running inefficiently it might decide to try running it on a different type of processor to save power.,or it might choose to ignore that if efficiency is less important than performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the only time windows 10 goes off the rails is when you need a feature that only the p-cores have.,"now it won't happen to many people, but i work with nested virtualisation and only the p-cores support the instruction set needed.",the e-cores don't.,"now windows doesn't know this, so the threads from vmware could land on either which can cause very interesting results i can say from experience.","if you're lucky the vm just won't start, if you're unlucky it starts and freaks out at some point when you are using it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is the only correct answer in this thread.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so if you are playing a game and youtube in the background for example.the e-cores would be used for youtube and the p-cores for the game?,what if you alt-tab in and out?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
correct.,for the same reason intel disabled avx-512 support on p-cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
interesting but why windows does not know it?,just as windows knows when the gpu has ai engines and when it does not (e.g.,"intel xe), why would windows dont know it is dealing with an alder lake cpu?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if u play something and something starts up, like an app or what ever your gaming perf will suffer a tiny bit because of a p-core will need to start up the application which might end up as a stutter for you at that moment before the application is handed on to the e-cores.",and i have tinkered a lot with the p/e cores.,when i game be it win 10 or 11 i get higher cpu loads and lower perf with the e cores on compared to when i simply run on p-cores only.,the p cores are stronger and therefore the cpuload is lower and perf higher.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
windows traditionally prioritizes whatever window has the focus.,if you had a budget system with only a few cores then when you alt-tab the new foreground window would start taking more cycles from the old one.,"on a midrange or higher system where you have 6-8 p cores and 4-8 e cores, probably not much changes since there are usually idle cores of both types available.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> interesting but why windows does not know it?,the os has no way to know what instructions a program will use until it uses them.,"it is actually up to the program to only use instructions that the cpu supports, so if the software doesn't understand that the e and p cores are different, you can easily have problems like that.",>just as windows knows when the gpu has ai engines and when it does not (e.g.,"intel xe)

windows has no idea what the gpu is doing internally.",the intel driver handles all of that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>when i game be it win 10 or 11 i get higher cpu loads and lower perf with the e cores on compared to when i simply run on p-cores only.,the p cores are stronger and therefore the cpuload is lower and perf higher.,yea....i keep hearing so much conflicting information about e-cores.some say for gaming you're better with them off some say they notice no difference.,i've seen videos of games having a smoother frametime with e-cores off/less stutters.,not excited at all the fact they are now a permanent thing for intel cpu's.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"fair point, but is there isuch thing as cpu ""driver""?","i would have thought intel would have coordinated with microsoft the ""optimization"" of windows kernel for a whole new platform no?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for rendering e cores are probably godsent, but for me as a gamer and for cad workload, well i dont need lots of slow cpu cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> fair point, but is there isuch thing as cpu ""driver""?","cpu is the thing running the os, so not really.",or to the extent that such a thing exists it would be the entire kernel.,">i would have thought intel would have coordinated with microsoft the ""optimization"" of windows kernel for a whole new platform no?",ms decided how windows programs would work back in the 1990s.,that ship sailed long ago.,"intel can coordinate with ms going forward, and can help developers patch software to support new features, but they can't change existing software on their own.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the unique selling point of windows 11 is that it can handle p and e cores better.,the thread scheduler can work with the cpu to make sure that the thread lands on the most fitting core.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so you disable them on your cpu?,i'm strictly speaking from someone who only intends to use their pc as a gaming pc and mostly likely is getting the 13900k.,i've heard of people straight up disabling them for their gaming rigs so it's not something unheard off.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes it should be.,"however, the z790 looks to be insignificantly different than z690 so not sure i would bother waiting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a lot of z690 boards have come down already.,i've been watching for a few months.,"however it is likely z790 boards will be announced with 13th gen on 27th september, only a week away!",probably worth waiting till then to be sure.,(probably another month until available),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iirc it was atleast rumoured that 13th gen intel processors some features that worked only on 700-series mb, so might be worth the wait if you are ever planning to upgrade within the same socked.",however seeing that you have 12900k upgrading to the 13th gen top model wouldn't make much sense.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it will be 100% compatible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"considering that 13th gen cpus will be compatible with z690 mobos, i think 12th gen cpus will also work with z790 mobos",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they are compatible with both 12th and 13th gen cpus but you may at a loss since 600 series is a lot cheaper plus you need to buy ddr5 ram with a 700 series boards since they are not compatible with ddr4 ram which is cheaper so maybe for the time being get 600 series board since the 12th gen cpu can easily handle all games and software for the coming 4-5 years so it's better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thanks for clarifying that.,can we expect 600 series prices to drop when 700 series boards drop?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
weâ€™ll have to hear what lord jensen presents us first,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"https://youtu.be/239u3ovw0mm

watch that.",you'll understand if you understand.,you can watch other of his videos on the subject if you want more data.,"most of mainstream youtubers use wrong combinations or horrible xmps, or simply never bother to tune memory.","so, they end up with bad results.",this guy is the only one i've seen focused on gaming that knows what he's doing.,"there's xoc people, but they all care about benchmarks only and use risky voltages for daily.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"maybe right at launch, but they will stop making as many.",much of the capacity for manufacturing will shift over to 700 series based boards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can you briefly summarize his main talking points as if i were a layman or complete novice?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok. i'll try to simplify ram as much as possible i guess.,so the main points for gaming and ram are bandwidth and latency.,this 2 things are directly correlated to your cpu and ram and how it works with games.,bandwidth is basically how much data can your memories transfer to/from the cpu in a clock cycle.,"this is affected by the mega transfers/megahertz  or mbps depending on how it is marketed, it is all the same, so that's the big number.","for example teamgroup t force ddr4 3600mhz, or ddr5 trident z5 6400mts, that 3600 or 6400 indicates each stick can do that amount of transfers in a clock cycle of the cpu.","simplified further, usually that 6400 will give you about 90,000mb/s of read and write bandwith.","whereas  4000 will give you about 60,000mb/s (super easy to achieve on intel)

99.9% of games stop scaling with bandwith at about the 45,000 to 50,000mb/s bandwith range.","meaning, even if the ram kit goes to 8000mt/mhz/mbps in most of the current and upcoming games it won't do anything because the extra bandwith won't get used anyways.","the only exception as of now has been spiderman if you use ray tracing at 1080p, but that seems like such an unrealistic scenario, since someone with a gpu capable of turning rt on in spiderman, is more than likely playing the game at 1440p or 4k, where the effect does no longer come into play, due to the gpu being the limiting factor before ram.","but if that's your case, spiderman at 1080p with rt on, benefits from the extra bandwith ddr5 provides.",in comes latency.,latency is basically how quick the memory can do everything is told to do internally.,"latency is determined by ram timings, by nature the more bandwith you have the harder it is to have a low latency at safe to ""daily-drive"" voltages.","now latency does affect games a lot more, makes sense, the less time it takes for the memory to finish the processes, the quicker everything else gets moving.",the timings start usually with the number you see advertised as c/cas/cl (it's all the same).,"but that can get super complicated so to simplify, ddr4 with tight timings has way less latency than ddr5 at any given frequency.","so if you have sub 45ns of latency on aida64 for example (only achieved with super ultra rare expensive ddr5 and manually tuned) and above 60,000mb/s of bandwith, ram is no longer the limiting factor of your build on the current intel platform.","and right now, that is doable by literally a $1,000 cheaper on ddr4 than it is on ddr5.","so, at most, super high end expensive ddr5 motherboards that only have 2 ram slots (4 slots board cant achieve the settings required) and expensive hard to find ddr5 ram, can tie your regular ol' samsung bdie ddr4 which can be had in any kit that has an xmp of 3600mhz c14, 4000c16 or 4000 17-17-17, or 4400mhz c19-19-19 for cheap price.","and all of those can be manually taken to 4000mhz+ which will give you the 60,000mb/s bandwith (more than enough above the 45,000mb/s) and keep the timings tight enough for that sub 45ns of latency.","right now for example, i have 61,000mbs bandwith and 37.5ns of latency with my ddr4 kit at 4100mhz c16-16-16-32 300trfc and other tuned subtimings.","no ddr5 kit is gonna touch my latency number, and no game will realistically benefit from higher bandwith than me.","so, no need to go to ddr5.","if they ever get those timings down while maintaining a 7600mts, then yes, maybe it'll be worth it if the price is low enough as well, but right now, there's no cpu capable of running that, including the new zen4 and i expect the same for raptor lake, their internal memory controllers won't permit it.","ram is way more complicated than this, and there's lots of other details, but this is a good gist of it, and it wasn't that brief after all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the explanation haha.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh and to your original actual question, the only advantage z790 has over z690 is that you can run 1 extra nvme (and by 1 more i mean like, one can run 4 and the other 5 without sacrificing lanes.)","it is not worth it imo, save your money and get the z690.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"""intel won't have native pcie gen 5 m.2 support till 14th gen meteor lake chips..""

"wccftech gets a lot wrong, but in this case the 14nm is accurate - it's referring specifically to the process node for the pch (chipset) itself.",z690 and z790 are indeed manufactured with intel's own 14nm.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not intending to argue but i there is very little info regarding zen 4 and 4 dimm support other than amd saying minimum native speeds will be 5200. so i would bet on all of x670 and 670-e boards having much better support at launch.,maybe the strategy will be the more expensive â€œe-variantsâ€ will have better support but i will almost guarantee amdâ€™s am5 launch will offer more support than intel has provided in a year+,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i get 5200 is 1 dpc.,to drop to 3600 with 2 dpc is standard meaning higher speeds will be available and functional.,"so no iâ€™m not confused that at launch i guarantee the qvl for 4 dimmâ€™s, regardless of speed, will be double alder lake.","with the difference in oc in am5 compared to am4, and with hallock from amd saying 6000 will be the â€œsweet spotâ€ concerning prices of ddr5 that means 2 dpc performance will definitely be over 3600-again the e variant moboâ€™s will probably market which ones have higher 2 dpc performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dude do you know what youâ€™re talking about?,alder lake and raptor lake is 4800 qvl with 2dpc.,"3600 at ddr5 is abysmal, and i didnâ€™t even know that was a jedec ddr5 frequency.",amd has also frequently overshot their alleged sweet spots.,they said 4000 was gonna be the zen 3 sweet spot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4000 is for zen 3. you clearly donâ€™t use any amd pcâ€™s.,also 2 dpc at 4800 is severely under supported-hence my original post.,if you actually used any of these cpuâ€™s or spent time looking at all of the support pages for these moboâ€™s you would understand-hence my original post.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4000 extremely rarely runs in synced mode on zen 3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
laptops are hot.,laptops with h cpus are particularly hot.,"what are the tdp (pl1/pl2) values set to, and what are the temperatures and package power draw during cpu stress tests like r23?",you can get these values from a program like hwinfo64.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's just how laptops are, you sacrifice size for cooling potential.",can't have everything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep this is standard behavior especially for that chip.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's normal for laptops.,download throttlestop and look at a few videos on how to use it.,you'll be amazed how much you can undervolt a laptop cpu and not lose that much/if any performance.,you'll drop double digits in temperatures.,also add a more aggressive fan curve and you'll be fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
buy desktop or limit power.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is the normal behavior of laptops.,specially intel laptops.,if you really want you can change the thermal paste to liquid metal at your own risk of course to get a few degrees less.,you could undervolt if intel allows it on 12th gen h processors (i donâ€™t know) and honestly that would give you huge benefits.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what's the cpu package power at 100c?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
should i worry temperature reach 100c for this processor i7 12700h?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"welcome to 2022.

check out the 2022 helios; it has enough cooling that it out-performs i9s and 3070s with an i7/3060 setup.",i haven't seen anything with comparable cooling in the price range.,i grabbed one for $999 and i think it's amazing; almost like they mispriced it.,"it's probably a good time to think long and hard about whether or not you need 20 threads in your laptop, and maybe do a little research to see if 95c is as bad as you think it is.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you'd need liquid metal to run cooler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel laptops are hot.,intel laptops with h cpus are particularly hot.,you need a laptop that's 3 fingers fat to accommodate a 115w i7 12700h.,monster performance comes with monster consumption that takes away from dgpus.,"op could have chosen amd h-class for less, but still very acceptable performance with the benefit of great thermals that leave headroom for the gpu to be pushed harder.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in 2018 (the last time i bought a laptop) things were a lot different.,i've never had temperatures like this before i needed a new one.,"now it seems like they're all hot (and with that, a truncated lifespan) and everyone just nonchalantly accepts it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
does that not indicate a severely truncated lifespan?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i've never tried throttlestop, but i maxed out the fans after 80c and it hasn't helped",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's the thing: research has yielded nothing but the utmost conflicting results.,i have never been able to unearth anything definitive about what a proper temperature range is supposed to look like for this (or any other) processor.,"also, core 3 in specific consistently reaches 100c",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not necessarily.,these chips are designed to get that hot but you wouldnâ€™t want to run them like that nonstop.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"throttlestop makes a good 10-15c difference, if not a tad bit more on my laptop.",then again my 8750h does underclock well.,"my laptop was throttling playing games in summer heat, hitting 98-99c, with full fans on even.",with throttlestop itâ€™s hovering in the low-med 80s instead.,"obviously different processors, different systems and so on, may not work so well for you.",itâ€™s worth a try though!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
totally fine.,the actual cpu is nowhere near that part of the ihs.,even then superficial scratches are fine on the raised portion if you properly apply thermal paste to fill the void.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yessir.,that's just natural from the bracket putting the necessary downward force on the chip to hold it securely in the socket and the cooler firmly atop it.,no worries brother man.,that just happens to be a friction point when you latch the chip into place.,"if anything, that just indicates that cpu has been installed and uninstalled several times.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
normal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
100% normal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the ihs is nickel plated copper and the frame is steel.,normal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i still don't understand why you people take out your cpus out of your motherboards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
these* sorry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[removed],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then this kind of scratches are common and almost every cpu got it after tightened the brackets?,i just realized today...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just two times (i had to dismount it for the first time in months due to i have to send the ao cooling back to amazon).,then this happens for almost all cpus and i was not a brute or something?,thanks for answer!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thank you so much, it doesn't seem like burnt or anything right?",btw happy cake day!,:),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i noticed some thermal paste on the green board so i wanted to clean it well until the new thermal paste arrives.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i just made a question, i seriously don't know what i said to make people answer like that.","edit: don't even worry, the other people have been nice and i've been told with education that this is completely normal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yup.,just don't go crazy tightening things down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the metal on top can take quite a bit of abuse, and these scratches are very normal with how much pressure the loading mechanism exerts to keep the cpu in the right place.","the underside and the socket on the other hand are a different story, so handle with care.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nah you're not a brute.,you are very welcome.,take care brother.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your answer confirm what i want to point.,your common sense is far far away.,"two metal pieces that make contact, how do you think looks like ?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i try to not worry, but since i have never noticed in my previous cpu and this one has only 4 months since i bought it... i just got paranoid.","edit: btw, thanks for your kind answer.",^^,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the pins and conectors of the underside are totally fine, i try to never touch them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
imo upgrade to 5600x as it will be massive upgrade for you and then use the money you save on getting a used 3080ti and forget about new 3060ti.,or wait for amd/nvidia next gen gpu.,if you were building new amd or intel build then i would suggest intel but as it stands for you getting the better amd cpu on same mobo is the way to go imo as its way cheaper for the performance boost.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it makes no sense to go to intel, when an upgrade to 5600x is cheaper.","the 5600x is really good and draws very little power, although personally if your motherboard can handle it, get the 5700x or 5800x.","at 8-core's, it's the sweet spot.",going to intel means buying another motherboard when you need to upgrade again.,"wait until the dust settles and you need to upgrade, then consider strongly amd with am5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the easiest is the 5600 drop in upgrade.,that a320 mobo doesnâ€™t have much resale value so the upgrade to the 12600k while better is very costly.,the 5600 will run a 3060 ti with no issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think even a 5600 non x will be significantly better, and you should save the rest towards a future gpu upgrade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
upgrade to ryzen.,"switching platforms is not worth it

if you want something that can compete with the 12600k, get a 5800x or 5700x.",both should be cheaper than the cost of getting a new motherboard and a 12600k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are comparing an intel z690 to your a320 motherboard.,the prices for an equivalent intel motherboard should be much lower.,that aside your pc does not look like an enthusiast device which needs any drop of performance so just go for price per performance.,you already have an am4 motherboard so just update your bios and buy a newer am4 cpu.,if you really want to do a big upgrade just wait for am5 and step it up to the next generation together with some ddr5 ram.,some years later upgrade to the last generation of am5 processors before am6 comes out.,might as well then invest in some proper x chipset or at least b. a is a ripoff in my opinion.,rinse and repeat.,thanks to amd everything is possible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i had a 5600x, paired with a 3080 ti and a 27"" 1440p 240 hz monitor.","it was absolutely awesome, no issues at all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"get the 5600x (or even the non x version), buying a 12th gen motherboard and a 12400f is more expensive than just getting the cpu.","it might be a bit slower compared to a 12600k in gaming, but it is still a very strong chip.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
let your wallet guide you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"bro, you can get the 5800x for the same price the 5600x was couple months ago.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
upgrade to 5600 non x. x is a lot more more for very small increase in performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you are willing to buy a new mobo to accommodate a new cpu, why not just go with the 5800x3d?",they are in the $350 range now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i went from 1600 to 5600x when it came out and the performance difference is insane,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"donâ€™t upgrade at all, you wonâ€™t see a difference in gaming with a 1660s.","really, what every builder should be doing is building the best system they can get for their budget, and then upgrading when it no longer suits their needs and not a minute sooner.",hold your setup a bit longer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
buy a 5800x3d and you'll be good for the next ten years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tfy to go for 5800x3d if you can stretch the budget.,its going to be good for years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5600x is sex.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
from a 1600af to a 5600x...that is a huge upgrade.,huge.,and you'll have the option to upgrade again later to a 5800x3d or a 5950x.,i think there's only one good answer to that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the ryzen 5 5600 is a path of lesser resistance, but that motherboard of yours is still utter garbage that wasn't really meant to be used with cpus that can draw a good bit of power, it will hold the 5600's potential back a little bit.","a320 boards have garbage vrm that can really only handle 65w cpus under heavy load when using a downdraft air cooler that's blowing air down onto the vrm, keeping temperatures low enough to maintain factory settings.","personally, i would buy a better motherboard regardless.","any b550 would be considerably better than that junk a320, and you'd get proper pbo support along with better memory support above 2933 mhz.","b550 and x570 also offer pci-e 4.0 support if you want that, it's not really important but if you ever wanted to use a pci-e 4.0 ssd, you'd need one of those boards and a 3000 series+ cputo properly use it.","msi b550-a pro is a good value, the vrm handles everything on am4, including the 5950x like an absolute champ.","b450 tomahawk max is also a good value board, while it lacks pci-e 4.0 and might struggle with a ryzen 9 cpu under stress loads, it's still good enough for a 5800x3d and it's cheaper than the b550-a pro.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ryzen 5 5600 is like $99-$140 on sale.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for the price of 12600k+mobo u can get a 5800x3d.,otherwise just go for 5600/x or 5700x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i am in the same spot, with asrock ab350m pro4.","i was thinking of just getting a 5600, but i have doubts how well it will work in such motherboard if it didn't support it from the getgo.",my current plan is to wait for zen4 and raptor lake and see what they have to offer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m happy and surprised to see sensible replies and not a single comment of blind fanboying,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
happy with 5600x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
amd obviously.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
theoretically speaking pci e 3.0 will be a slight limiting factor but itâ€™s a wonderful budget build you got right now and it would be a wonderful budget build again for at least a few more years if money saved by *not* buying a new mobo and possibly ram went into a better gpu instead.,note: nvidia gpu more punishing to older cpu for some driver related reason.,"https://youtu.be/g03fzsyundu

whenever upgrading or swapping gpu (even nvidia to nvidia or amd to amd) make sure you use display driver uninstaller in safe mode to clean out the old graphics drivers so the new one can have a clean install.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
either save some money by going 5600x/5800x3d or wait until am5 and rocket lake are available and then upgrade to next gen if you're going to have to switch platforms anyways.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel ftw,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what ram do you have?,5600 non x would be great.,then spend every $ on a graphics card.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a ryzen 2600 system with a gtx 1060 currently and am planning to upgrade to raptor lake.,"it makes sense for me to upgrade to intel 13th gen as i am planning to build a new pc, 

if you are cash-strapped however, and intend to keep your current pc, dropping in a 5600x will probably be easier.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i recently upgraded an older intel to a 5600x.,noticeable upgrade and was cheaper than buying the faster processor in that old socket.,iâ€™m impressed with the 5600x and would get it again if given the choice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"5600x, but if i was you, i'd wait a little longer until i had more cash and get a 5950x, and then call it quits for the next 6 years or more.","5950x is best for gaming, productivity, and longevity, 5600x is good for gaming, decent for productivity, and alright for longevity, and if you were to get a 5800x3d, it would be incredible for gaming, good for longevity, and pretty good for productivity.",edit: update your bios before installing the new cpu (for compatibility and saving yourself a headache),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wait for new gen to drop and get that or get last gen parts when theyâ€™re less,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"would like to add one more thing, check out r/hardwareswap if you havnt already.",might find a ryzen 5 3600/ram kit to hold you over till you can get a better mobo/cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why do you post this in intel community and asking intel fanboys for advices???,are you expecting an answer from them that you should switch to 5600x?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't think you should be asking this here.. obviously people will say intel coz duh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well i do agree under prime circumstances, its pointless for him to go above 2600 as the boards vrms will throttle at best and burn up at worst with anything higher.",and then theres the 2666mhz ram he stated in this thread.,wont pair with a 5600x at all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i can't believe people are still pretending the new amd motherboards are going to have a meaningfully longer lifecycle than intel's.,amd all but came out and said it won't be a repeat of am4.,"three years ish, 12-18 months product lifecycle, that's two generations people...

might have figured it out.,you need the afterburner 4.6.5 beta 2. that seems to report much more sensible numbers.,apparently windows 22h2 update changed something in the reporting system and thats the culprit.,some people also claiming that cpu util also went down and that cpu perf is actually worse in gaming but do not know about that myself.,still only getting like 45% utilization but that still makes at least some sense.,would not mind more util tho.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

nope.,"it hovers around 92-96 in ""normal"" areas so then its ofcourse gpu bound.",but in the market behind toms diner for example the gpu usage can go down to as low as 65 though its around 70-80 normally.,it seems like my cpu usage just doesnt really change much.,unless im completely in a lonely corner somewhere.,might go down to 30% but everywhere else its always pretty much 40-45 and never goes above that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

awesome!,"thank you

do you have the full name of the cpu, as reported by [https://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html](https://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html) ?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
suspect you're right the power limits have been set strictly.,it's unlikely you'll be able to alter the power limits on a laptop - most of the time the manufacturer has hardcoded them to match the cooling solution they've put in.,a program like intel xtu would let you see the power limits and attempt to adjust them - but i suspect that needs admin to run and in any case might not work.,"for example, xtu lets me see my pls on my razer laptop but altering them doesn't actually do anything for me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
check xtu to see why it's throttling (pretty sure you can run it without admin) but probably normal.,laptops aren't meant to sustain heavy loads so they tend to throttle aggressively.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

then scoll down and max out the following settings by putting in 9999: long duration power limit, long duration maintained, short duration power limit, cpu core current limit.",make sure dual tau boost is disabled.,run cinebench for 10 minutes and see if youâ€™re getting >20k.,if not try increasing vcore compensation.,by doing this plus a slight manual undervolt  i managed to score 21767 pts in r23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i donâ€™t have any experience with that, but i suspect most settings are capped on th bios level for safety reasons so they canâ€™t be easily modified by software.",you can use hardwareinfo64 to check if your cpu really is running at 200w and 5ghz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

all core max is 4.5ghz for 12700f.,"if you only got 4.2 then something throttled, maybe temps got to 100c on the cpu.",not sure if vrm throttling can also drop clocks?,if you only game it's possible you can maintain 4.5ghz in games even if you can''t in cinebench.,edit:misspellings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
btw do you know what does turbo ratio mean?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that was the moboâ€™s 125w long term power limit.,4.3 ghz is the highest my 12700f goes after turbo expires and with undervolting.,"itâ€™s not bad at all, doesnâ€™t really impact performance and your pc is quieter and more power efficient.",i still scored 21k in r23.,before undervolting my cpu would drop to something like 3.5ghz and there was measurable drop in performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your cpuâ€™s clockspeed is the base clock (bclk) multiplied by the cpu core ratio.,most of the time bclk is 100mhz.,for the 12700f the all core turbo ratio is 4.5. so it runs at (100mhz)*(4.5)=4500mhz=4.5ghz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can only set your own ratios with cpus that have k in the name.,your max ratio is 49x (for 4900 mhz) but only when single (or two?,not sure) core is doing work with 12700f.,all cores doing work max ratio is 45 for 4500 mhz assuming motherboard and cooling can handle it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

real-world benchmarks?,"cinebench may be a synthetic, but itâ€™s a reasonable proxy for the average multithreaded rendering workload.","in cinebench, then, the i7-12700h is about an i5-12400 in multicore at its stock power limit and doesnâ€™t beat an i5-12600k no matter how hard you push it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
benchmarks don't tell the whole story since laptop manufacturers are free to tune the cpu as they see fit.,how much cooling capacity a laptop has also plays a big factor.,"when you get a small 13,3 or 14 inch laptop with an i7 in it, those boost clocks are not going to be maintained for long.",a good cpu can be held back by poor thermal design on the part of the oem.,i've got a latitude 5421 for work and it has a core i7 11850h.,"it's certainly no slouch that laptop, but the heat can hold it back when you run a cpu intensive task for a length of time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my laptop has a i9 12900h, the cb23 score is about 18700. the cpu limit is 115w, and that is sustained, it throttles to about 100w because of heat.","it really depends on the cooling of the laptop, most dell laptops with a i7 12700h can only sustain 45w.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"single-core should be about on par with the tier-lower desktop part, a single golden core core can generally hit its maximum boost frequency with ~25w.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

definitely an engineering sample.,"i note that what you have there is listed at just 1.8ghz base speed versus the normal at 3.1ghz, which got me curious, since while engineering samples are often clocked lower, not usually that much lower.","and from a little reading, what you have is actually an odd ~185 watt 26-core cpu that is more accurately labeled as an es of the 8164 or 8170. and is apparently very tough to actually find bios support for.",so definitely not a 28-core 255w w-3175x and definitely not worth $3000.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i am more interested in 13700k.,hopefully it's still a 200watt and below part like 12700k and just better than 12900k still.,i would swap the 12700k for it.,15% st is good chunk better and probably can sell 12700k to cover most of the cost.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that's only true for 7950x.,rest of the stack will lose badly to rpl.,13700k is probably way cheaper than 7900x at $550 even after the expected price increase.,13600k is probably straight up better than 7700x for less money.,"7600x is a joke....

i expect some kind of rdna1 style price cut from amd after rpl is revealed or maybe they wait a few months see how it plays out.",the cpu prices on top of the absurd motherboard prices are just not competitive imo.,everything is more expensive on amd this gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

idk why your comment is controversial.,enough leaks have shown that you're gonna need a 360mm for both the 7950x and 13900k to get their potential beyond 200w at reasonable fan speeds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intel has dlvr.,this unlocks headroom.,hence also probably why clocks went up to 6ghz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
350w is a very far cry from 230w.,"amd is definitely bumping up the wattage, but they are nowhere near the wattage intel is trying to push.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i'm not so sure about those points, especially with the rumored 20% price increase across the board for intel.","the 13700k won't be ""way cheaper"" than the 7900x if it ends up being $500.",it will also almost certainly lose to the 7900x in st and match or barely beat it in mt.,"the 13600k will most likely also lose in st to both the ""joke"" 7600x and 7700x.","in mt it should easily beat the 7600x (kinda obvious here, comparing a 14c/20t cpu to a 6c/12t one) and also outperform the 7700x.","purely from a gaming-only perspective, people might prefer the 7700x, even the 7600x if looking for the cheapest way into the am5 platform then have the option to upgrade to the much more potent 3d v-cache versions late this year or early next year.","everything being more expensive on amd this time around is expected - brand new platform with ddr5, pci-e gen5, etc.","it's always been like this when a brand new platform launches, no matter if amd or intel.","there's a reason people call it ""early adopter tax"".",give it a few months and it will come down to a much more reasonable level.,"especially once the b650 and b650e boards hit the market, which if the rumors are true, isn't even that far off at early-mid october.","if anything, this generation seems like amd and intel will, for the most part, be closer in performance than we've had ever before.","which, at the end of the day, is fantastic news for all of us consumers, no matter if intel or amd preference; competition is king.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in mt that may be true.,"you forget that the intel skus have a large reduction in boost clock, whereas the amd stack, not so much.","firstly, anything below the 13600 is still adl and not rpl.",intel boost clock is 5.8 ghz for top sku 13900k.,"next best, 13700k loses 400 mhz, with boost of 5.4 ghz.","13600k loses another 300 mhz, with boost of 5.1 ghz .",thats a 700mhz drop from 13900k to 13600k.,zen4 goes from 7950x boost of 5.7 ghz  down to 5.3 ghz on 7600x.,that is only a 400 mhz drop.,"if st scores are equal at the top skus, (13900k vs 7950x), but in the lower skus one drops 700mhz and the other only 400 mhz, i expect amd ones to be better on st and lost on mt.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

13700k has significantly better multicore performance as intel's stack added another cluster of efficiency cores across most of their lineup.,i have a 12700k and am happy but the first generation motherboards are so bad.,i have samsung b-die ddr4 and it won't overclock on my itx motherboard.,so that's over 10% performance i'm losing despite having some of the best ram available.,ddr5 was just too expensive a year ago while being inferior to my b-die.,now i can buy a 13700k and ddr5  and a new motherboard and probably get better than 20% single core performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not the same.,13900k will be limited to 250w.,300w is when you unlock the limit which intel allows because they always scale better with more power than amd,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
people think chips are hard to cool if they run hotter than they expect.,except people abitrarily decide the temp a chip should run at.,"if they had a chip before that runs 65c, they'll randomly decide a chip running at 80c is running too hot then buy a bigger cooler to feel happier when it runs at 70c, all the while it runs great at 80c and runs 0.5% faster at 70c which you can't notice.",people are weird about this shit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"all the leaks i've seen indicate 230w under boost mode, so you know, not even remotely close to as bad.","of course we need to wait for benchmarks, but i don't understand where people get the idea zen4's power increase is anywhere near as bad as raptor lake's.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

13900k in this test is pulling 350 watts.,pretty sure there is no cost advantage on the intel's side as far as cooling is concerned.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the real issue is that going to zen 4 requires upgrading to an am5 capable motherboard which means customers can also just switch to an intel platform if theyâ€™re going through the trouble of buying new ram/cpu/mobo.,"so intel can grab back market share this generation, especially further down the stack.","still, probably going to be a bad year for both of them given overall market conditions stinking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"350 watts is bad but if it's transferring the temps well to the ihs and the cpu cooler, it's not so bad.","what makes amd ryzen chips so bad is the offset causes odd spikes to happen, so one second your 50 degrees the next  you're 75+,  then back down 10 or 15.

hopefully the gold layer they're putting on helps with the spikyness, cause honestly that's all they need to figure out.",a good aio should be able to have plenty of thermal density to dump heat into slowly and get rid of it if the spikes are handled better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you should look up the actual transistor density specs of these nodes instead of just repeating the marketing numbers.,intel 7 is very comparable to tsmc n7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they are calling it n5 now as nm makes zero sense at this point.,only ignorant folks think tsmc have it at real 5nm while intel is at 10nm.,these days tx density is not doubling with every shrink as well.,so tsmc can name it anything.,that said n5 is way superior to intel 7. that's all that matters.,kudos to intel architects that they are able to release some client cpu that can hold while being so behind in process tech.,intel desperately needs to execute on node shrinks as planned.,especially for dc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

details: i have this problem since i bought the monitor last july.,"the monitor supports up to 144hz using hdmi, which i tested on my pc and my brother's.",i'm wondering why it is showing displayport connection type instead of hdmi and my i can't set the resolution higher than 60hz.,"i tried using cru(custom resolution utility) and found out that i can manually set the refresh rate as long as the pixel clock doesn't exceed 297mhz, which is hdmi 1.4 speed.",my guess is that intel driver is not properly detecting hdmi 2.0 connection so i tried using linux and everything is working as intended there 1440p 144hz and all.,is this a common issue with intel iris xe?,is there a known fix to this?,edit.,forgot to mention that i already did a fresh windows install.,drivers reinstallion.,tried old driver version and also the latest one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had a weird issue like this  (but with bit depth) with a certain igpu/monitor combo.,i wrote to the intel support forum and someone actually answered and fixed it in a driver later on.,so i would recommend going that route.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bad cable maybe?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
use driver booster app,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you 100% sure your intel chipset supports hdmi 2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"would definitely do this, thanks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i just tried this, and issue persists.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes the cpu is 11300h, gpu iris xe and port is hdmi 2.0. once again, when i tried booting into a linux distro i can get up to 1440p 144hz right away.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
try installing a driver for your monitor.,"i know it sounds weird, but iâ€™ve done it before and found that it fixed the refresh rate options.",many monitors have drivers to inform windows about color profile and resolution options.,the only time iâ€™ve ever needed a monitor driver was to fix this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you confirmed that your notebook also supports hdmi 2.0?,while the igpu supports it the board also needs to be wired for it.,"same with the highest displayport speed (hbr3), which requires additional hardware components on the board.",have you confirmed that you are not using chroma-subsampling under linux?,this would conserve enough bandwidth to still reach 144hz at hdmi 1.4 speeds.,some drivers do this automatically.,"&#x200b;

with intel the monitor outputs are internally basically all displayports and more or less use the dp++ functionality to ""just"" output hdmi.","i believe it is up to the manufacturer to correctly define if one of those ports is hardwired for hdmi only (my alder lake cpu shows ""hdmi"" for a native hdmi 2.0 port on the board).","also, with previous cpu generations intel only supported hdmi 1.4 natively, for hdmi 2.0 the manufacturer needed to build in a dp-to-hdmi converter chip similar to what is in dp-usb-c to hdmi adapters.","these are shown as ""displayport"" in the intel driver.","&#x200b;

=> whether the driver showing ""displayport"" is already an indication of things going wrong would depend on how the board is built.","while tige lake should support native hdmi 2.0 output, maybe the manufacturer decided against it for historical or signal integrity reasons?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i already tried this.,i think intel iris xe drivers is messing up the connector type detection because all the supported resolutions are listed in the screenshot and the connector type i'm using is hdmi but is detected as displayport.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
really really great point dude!,i am wondering the same.,i sent an email regarding this to the laptop support and they send the specsheet of the laptop that says hdmi 2.0. is there any way i can physically check this or any app than can detect what hdmi protocol does my laptop have?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not that i know of, although hdmi 2.0 is not technically a precise enough spec, as just like with 2.1 this includes all prior versions.",do they give a max.,resolution?,"this is often the most accurate method of gaging the actual minimum speed, although it is usual for hdmi 2.0 to mean the 18 gbit/s actual speed.","4k60 more or less guarantees that the port can actually do 18 gbit/s (claiming this, while only supporting with 4:2:0 chroma subsampling should be basically criminally misleading)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as linus said in one of his recent wan shows: if they were going to cancl it, they would be denying it vehemently until the last minute.","that's just how marketing works, they'd immediately have a doa product on their hands if they just hinted at a cancellation.","up until recently, intel marketed optane, kept showing off new reasons why optane is going to be awesome in the future.",the marketing didn't stop until the day they announced the cancellation publicly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
arc won't die.,some form of it will likely live in laptops for years to come.,whether we get battlemage on pc's is up in the air i would say at this point.,but ofc until intel doesn't come out and oficialy cancel it its all a rumor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you can get ahold of an arc card now it should make a good collector's item.,the best we can hope for at this point is that intel will re-enter the discreet desktop market in a few years once conditions in the market improve.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
optane ran for years though.,ultimately it could die off but if they follow in the same footsteps of optane it will be years until it's dead.,but optane was killed off by lower prices by the competition for a superior product.,if the next gen amd and nvidia gpu's are that much better and the supply can be met then intel may have some issues.,when intel fixes their drivers i believe it will hit the competition a bit and we have to see where it goes from there.,i will say the arc a380 for rendering out av1 codec video it spanks my 3070ti for a fraction of the cost and is competitive for performance of h.264/265 and way cheaper than the competition.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what are you smoking?,don't tell me this is some nonsense linus came up with.,">up until recently, intel marketed optane, kept showing off new reasons why optane is going to be awesome in the future.",the marketing didn't stop until the day they announced the cancellation publicly.,optane was effectively dead when they stopped working on a next generation.,they were very clear on canceling products since their consumer effort failed a few years back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we do just have to wait and see how it plays out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if the drivers were stable and it worked with my oculus i probably would have kept it installed instead of my 3070ti as i do a lot of video editing and it's way faster using av1.,we will have to wait and see what next gen gpu's will be able to do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"used mining gpu from nvidia and amd, plus unsold ampere stocks will stop arc cold.",and new gpu from amd and nvidia will take attention away from intel arc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for certain markets, probably but for video editing and production of the next gen competition doesn't step up their game then intel is the only one with the product that many will buy.",think about it if it was $599 for an intel gpu that was faster at video editing than a competitor who charges $1200+ for similar performance editing studios would exclusively use intel arc.,"they could spend more on disk subsystems, networking, ram and even processors.","also for servers netflix, hulu, etc.",would also upgrade to intel cards if they outperformed the existing nvidia gpu's.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for professional environment, stability and familiarity is important, some place might try testing out intel arc, but they won't make full commitment.","this will take years for a place to switch over, if intel arc was clearly the better product, and i highly doubt nvidia/amd would give up competing in this segment.","(for example, just look at how many year for amd to gain 20% server marketshare, when they clearly had vastly better server cpu since zen 2 rome)

&#x200b;

for you average user, they can always pick up used cards.",and you are making an assumption nvidia/amd doesn't make productivity improvement for their next gen product that could surpass intel arc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it'll happen automatically when there's thermal head room.,you can't manually control it .ost likely on a laptop.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and here i am with an i7-5930k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wait for 13600k and z790.,it will be a worthy upgrade.,you can use your old ddr4 ram too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
while you wait for the upgrade overclocking cpu and ram will give a nice boost.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the i9 9900(k) will be more than enough for the 3060 (or 3070, or even higher)

note that for fps games fast ram and low latency are also important",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"is your cpu a bottleneck for siege, and other high fps optimized games, yes.","is it outdated, depends on your expectations.","if your performance in siege is satisfactory, don't worry about it.","my gpu load isn't exactly high in ow either given that i'm running 1080p low-med settings for clarity with a 12700k 3070 pairing, but that's expected behavior.",these games are made to run light.,i'm pretty sure you can still make your gpu scream before your cpu in more graphically intensive games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i just bought a 12600k, no regrets.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you could drop in an i7 and your motherboard may support 9th gen with a bios update.,but if you wait for the 13th gen you'll see the biggest jump in performance going to the latest gen. or get 1-2 gen older when on sale but you'll still need a compatible motherboard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rocking the i5 8400 with an rtx 3080 and its just a great combo for either 1440p/144 or 4k/60.,of course i'll upgrade the cpu eventually but im in no rush.,what resolution are you playing at?,siege isnt a demanding game from what i remember so do you maybe have the framerate uncapped?,you should be able to do 144fps without a hitch on an 8600k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you using a 1080p monitor?,"8600k shouldn't a terrible pairing for a 3060, but maybe that's just r6.","like, what kind of fps are you getting, because that should be the main concern over weather the cpu hits 100% or whatever

imho, consider 1440p monitor if you're still on a 1080p panel",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you have a few options.,"first, what resolution do you play at?",you could always get a higher end monitor and play at 1440p if youâ€™re not already.,or even use image scaling (i forget the name) but it has the gpu render at a higher quality but downscales it to produce a better image.,you could also upgrade the cpu only.,"you have the option of a 8700k, 9700k, or even a 9900k/ks which would all give a significant bump.",or you could try overclocking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wait for zen 4/raptorlake launch in a few weeks.,although raptorlake will launch on a dead end platform,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you have the money, wait for 13th gen. if money is tight, 12th gen i5's are really good, 12400 is on par with my 10700k if not a lil better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i use the 8600k set to 4.8ghz on all cores.,i play at 1440p so i don't think it has much of an impact on performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you have a j batch you can get a very good oc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

z790 will be pointlessly overpriced compared to z690 while not offering a whole lot more...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
was going to comment that the results may be marginal at best but looking at this [video](https://youtu.be/viu7ry-b-wm) it seems it may be worth the tweaking time for some free gains.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for intel it doesnt matter too much, if you have 3000mhz the performance will be almost identic to lets say 3600mhz.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"can confirm i use a 9900k with my 3070ti and it's a stellar combo for aaa games at 1440p, shit the 9700k is basically the same and may even be cheaper.","just my anecdotal experience, your mileage may vary!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a 9900k won't make much of a difference to op outside of the increased clock frequencies which an 8600k be set to as well (at least 4.7 ghz on all cores), as well as the increased cache capacity and maybe some slight benefit from ht and 2 extra cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
strange.. iâ€™m playing with 1920x1080 @ 144hz with 3:2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4790k but yeah same feels.,good luck brother!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my laptop has a i7-640m lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
source that will be overpriced?,it may very well end at the same msrp based on different models.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's not only about the frequency but also timings, having low latency is good for games and xmp profiles usually have quite loose timings, so tightening them will help a bit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so whats the problem?,you aren't hitting 144fps?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it will be overpriced because it's new... 


remember the big price increase z690 has over z590?",well z790 will have minimally as big price increase as that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not even close.,around 85-110 fps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"don't think so, z790 is a refresh for z690, it will most likely have the same price.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah so it looks like a cpu bottleneck then if you're seeing 90 - 100% usage while only hitting ~100 fps.,strange... i havent played siege in a really long time so i guess i dont remember how the optimization was.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i believe undervolting is what really matters.,360 aio coolers must be very close in performance if installed correctly.,"with very small undervolting im getting much lower temps even with air cooler
what is your score difference after u did -.1?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would recommend also getting a contact frame (either the thermalright or thermal grizzly brand) for even better temps.,im running my 12900kf with the frame and it helped with spikes in temps drastically and allowed me to push the core clocks more,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26000 points would be a fine result with 0.1 offset i believe.,i got slightly higher than 26000 but i only did 0.035,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i was like you, but with an air cooler (be quiet dark rock pro 4).",i switched for a asus rog ryujin 2 360 + thermal grizzly bracket mod + thermal grizzly paste and now my temps are lower than ever.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's so crazy!,i of the same cpu and i of never had that issue using the phanteks aio that i of.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
voltage offsets helped me with temps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it might shock you, but even the x73 isnâ€™t a great cooler compared to the likes of a ek or arctic aio.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">i unfervolted by 0.1v and

thats quite a bit of undevolt",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whats the power draw now vs before though?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">even 100c + on cinebench

the 12900k will run 100c in cinebench with most coolers, unless power limits are enforced",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh...wow... so it really is a piece of crap.,i'll be getting my money back then.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm looking to use a 420mm aio, or will that do little",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you need to be very careful with undervolting as it can result in clock stretching.,use cinebench to make sure you performance doesnâ€™t take an unusual hit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i couldn't even get a score on my old cooler, it was genuinely an awful cooler.",it would throttle on cinebench instantly so i never managed to get a score.,i tried undervolting it with the old cooler but it still throttled.,"it really is just the new cooler, it's well made and not a piece of crap like the msi pump that's built into the radiator...god knows why... 

my idle temps are now 24c and load is 45c

old temps were idle 35c and load 80c",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

nope.,i'm getting 60-70c under full load on cinebench with an nzxt x73 now.,haven't changed anything other than cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the only problem with 420 ones is fitting them into case lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it will do little.,the only tangible improvement you will get is from a custom loop or a push/pull setup on the aio for better airflow.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"gn did do arctic liquid freezer 420 vs 360, and iirc, there wasnt all that much of a difference between them",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"undervolting is tricky but yes, its a dangerous thing to do.",there's very cool article made on asus rog forums covering undervolting process of 12 gen intels.,i believe it takes much more effort and exploring to understand process rather than dropping off some mw on settings tab.,"if you're keen with electronics or did some hobby builds you probably know that 12v device can run on 10-11v, but will drain more power instead.",it comes from basic ohms law.,"just like overclocking, undervolting is something you need to be careful about.","undervolting is trending nowadays, just like first waves of massive overclocking popularity back in the days.",you can see numerous undervolting threads on your reddit feed if you're subscribed on 1-2-3 tech subreddits.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, the msi coreliquid coolers have serious problems with clogging and build up.",the -100mv undervolt is most likely not 100% stable unless your 12900k is a launch batch that had avx512 and tvb disabled despite having a voltage table fused for it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
damn iâ€™m jealous of you guys getting idle temps so low.,"no matter what i do with any of my cpus and coolers, idle temps are always about 30c, even though load is also like 55-60c.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you also underclock it?,my system gets unstable after a 45mv undervolt ready,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12900 is a different animal to tame for thermals.,yours is not the only such story from what i have seen and read.,"msi had a recall on 240mm and 360mm aio's and those replacements seem to not suffer the same build up in time frame but, we also don't know how much longer it will last either, not enough time yet to tell so could very well still be an issue i'm sure the public will inform us..  i had one such units but never used and they replaced it with a bnib new revision though it did take 3weeks to a month to arrive.","its still bnib lol =)

i guess i been holding on to it for a ""oh shit"" moment where i may need a quick backup or alternative if my main rad and pumps failed or leaked.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
op isn't asking for redditors who don't read beyond the title for a fix.,op already fixed it by swapping out the broken aio,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thats because you are not loosing points anymore because of throttle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, temps and quality wise.",both of them use better and higher quality pumps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1) i said *most coolers*.,"i've tested ~30 cpus coolers with alder lake, and only a few of them can handle the 12900k in cinebench without hitting tjmax

2) i suspect your undervolt is still applied (or something else is holding it back), unless you mean 60-70c *over ambient*",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fractal torrent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there's gotta be some benefit tho right?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh, ok",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
undervolting is not dangerous.,"you risk losing stability, but you wonâ€™t break any hardware",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have no idea what those words mean but it hasn't seemed to have any issues yet, it's in an adaptive offset mode and hasn't had any issues yet.. besides, undervolting is never going to damage the cpu so i'm not too fussed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what's your ambient temperature though?,"and i'm running fans/pump quite high rpm on idle as my pc is only used for sim racing and gets shut down as soon as im done, so fans are always close to max.",30c idle is still good if your ambient room temp is 20c ish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
idle is usually ambient + 10 c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what do you mean by unstable?,i haven't noticed any issues,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how did they get a new aio cooler and test it so quickly?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah still have my undervolt, do you test them without undervolting?",would surely be hard to differentiate between coolers if they all hit the throttles instantly?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you underestimate how much performance regresses as you move up in aios.,a simple push/pull will outweigh any aio upgrade past 240/280 to 360/420.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i did a step-down undervolting from 0.010 to 0.08. at 0.08 cinebench score was way too small, until 0.03 i had cores throttle still.","by 0.035 my temps stabilized on 90c cinebench and 70-72 game load, which was fine for me.",i don't remember exact numbers now but cinebench score was very close to stock voltages aside loosing nearly 20 degrees temps.,probably performance loss is somewhere around 5% which is totally fine for me.,this is yet very individual for every cpu unit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
crashes under high load due to the lack of enough power going to the cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">yeah still have my undervolt, do you test them without undervolting?",correct.,i want my results to be realistic for those who don't tinker.,>would surely be hard to differentiate between coolers if they all hit the throttles instantly?,"i test at multiple power limits - no limits enforced, 200w, and 140w for most coolers",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah, mines been on cinebench for 10mins around 100% load and seemed fine, its weird how the same chip is so different between different setups...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in cinebench i thermal throttle instantly, cant run a full 10 min, i have a cm ml 360 rgb aio, maybe time for a different one as well?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"absolutely time, you on the i9-12900k too?",i had exactly the same issue until i changed coolers.,can't recommend the nzxt x73 enough.. been fantastic so far.,i went from throttling instantly like you to 60-70c on cinebench.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

slow gpu = fewer fps / lower resolution/complexity = cpu gets to loaf because its partner canâ€™t keep up.,fast gpu = higher fps / greater resolution/complexity = cpu has to work more to keep it supplied with data.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what does your system not do that you wish it could?,many others and i have fallen into the trap of upgrading just to upgrade.,sometimes iâ€™ve not even noticed any performance increase.,does your system feel slow?,did you start doing a new workload that your cpu canâ€™t handle?,are you bottlenecking other components like your gpu?,"if not, consider keeping it and being happy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"no, you should always aim to keep your current setup for at least three years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is the 10400 not doing something that you need it to?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, no and no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'd recommend you to not upgrade it and wait for the 13 generation, since both of them you need to change your motherboard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you bottlenecked by the 10400?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'd probably go and get like a 11700k or something cuz your mobo can handle it (might need a new bios though, but that's nothing a thumb drive and a youtube tutorial can't fix), and you'll get a similar upgrade without needing a new mobo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if u play on fhd - yes, but i would wait for 13400",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
paying the extra money how.,"to replace your entire system, or to up-spec a brand new system from the 10400 to 12400?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not really i have 3080 ti with a i5 10400 f as long as u playing 2k to 4k it dose not make a difference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean if you have a i5 10400 and never see it hit more than 50% usage i would say no because its really not necessary i have a i5 10400f and game at 3440x1440 without issues with only a rx6600 both are low wattage and low temp and makes for a solid budget gaming pc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you experiencing issues / slowdowns with your current cpu?,"if yes, then upgrade.","if no, don't.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in short, no i don't think so.","atleast upgrade when your cpu is 5 years old from the day of release and when it can't perform like you want it to, like bottlenecking newer games.",i recently upgraded from an i5 7400 to i5 12400f based on this.,the 7400 used to bottleneck even my gtx 1660 in most games released from 2017 onwards.,"now i am able to get the full performance from my gpu, and even i can upgrade my gpu later, with something like the rtx 3070 or similar down the line without worrying about bottlenecks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not yet, wair for the 13th gen and upgrade.",that will help you future proof for 6 years to say the least.,also get a good gpu like a 3070ti or 3070 so you can have a good experience with it and not have to upgrade any soon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not worth unless you have like very high end gpu..... i5 10400 is still very capable cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
id say wait a bit longer for the new gen cpus and see what they have to offer.,id say the 10400 is more than adequate for games (i assume you use your oc for gaming based on your username) for now and i think upgrading and paying full price for a new cpu/mobo now is mot worth it when new cpus are just around the corner,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why?,"thereâ€™s no discernible difference in performance 

itâ€™s a waste of money",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just go to an i7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nah not right now.,hodl for 13th gen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
upgrading cpu on intel?,lmao.,you need to replace mobo so it's only worth it if you replace whole/almost whole rig.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13400 is better option,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for all the replies.,i felt that my gpu (rtx 3070) was slightly bottlenecked by the cpu.,i don't find my system slow but it kinda bugs me that my gpu is not able to 'unleash its true power'.,"my understanding from the replies to this discussion are that i should wait for the 13th gen. if i have not understood correctly, pls correct me.",thank you once again,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this is a great point, i myself have upgraded just to upgrade and now i'm sitting on thousands of dollars worth of cpu's, gpu's and a motherboard.","although, i did upgrade from an i7 8086k to a 9900k, but like you said, i couldn't tell, i more just did it because i wanted to keep my 8086k because it was ""limited"".","now looking back i have regrets, i do this with everything i get into.","it's like an addiction, i just had to buy stuff because it's new or ""better"".",i like your reply and i think that's the best way to look at it and make a decision.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

my rule of thumb is *never* build a new pc unless i can get around **double** the single-threaded performance of my current one (not a hard-set rule but i try to follow it as closely as possible).,that way i never feel like i spent too much money for too little gain.,"that being said, here's my build history:

1st build: 1998     
2nd build: 2000 (2 year gap)  
3rd build: 2003 (3 year gap)        
4th build: 2007 (4 year)        
5th build: 2014 (7 year) [current pc]    
6th build: 2023 (9 year)      
7th build: late 2030s?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes because i7 960 > i5 12400f,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's a little different than 10400 to 12400.

the 3600 --> 10700k (using passmark) is about a 13% single thread and 5% multithread performance boost.","10400 --> 12400 is a full 39% single thread, and 59% multithread upgrade.","it may not still be worth it for op (gaming will show a lot less benefit unless you're doing simulators, or have an rtx 3090) but those are pretty beefy upgrades..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13400 also comes with e cores which the 12400 lacks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not really.,more like 12600k but locked.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"unfortunate, but that's how they decided it to be for now",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thatâ€™s a really good rule of thumb, and more people should follow it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i like this idea.,first i've heard of it.,how does one determine this exactly?,edit: clarifications i currently have an i5-8400 and primarily use the computer for gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just moved from 6700k to 12700k.,in many games it doubles performance and productivity quadrupled.,you might be there depending on workload.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"same here
1st build 2005
2nd build 2013 (8 year) 
3rd build 2018 (5 year, technically previous build was still in use for my brother, i just found a used gaming pc and 144hz monitor for dirt cheap so grabbed it)

i miss the old days.,"if you bought the first pentium 3 processor - 450 or 500 mhz in february 1999, about 13 months later you could get a 1 ghz pentium 3, or a 1 ghz athlon processor, both of which roughly had 2x integer (thanks to better cache structure), and the k7 probably had more like 2.8x-3x the fpu.",i am curious which 2014 cpu you're running.,i7-4790k (june 2014) will probably not be doubled until \~ 13900ks..  which lines up with your 2023.,(12900ks is \~ 90% higher single thread).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"good rule of thumb, i upgrade to be able to sell my old stuff before they lose most of their value or are so old noone would want to buy them",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a similar rule but itâ€™s for multicore performance due to my primary workload being compiling and gaming secondary.,"i tend to look at passmark, compiler benchmarks and lzma/xz compression as they have the most impact.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lga 1366 westmere is actually pretty good when you oc.,ofc not as good as a 12400f but good enough for an entry level gpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's a fair point.,but since the guy is likely intrested in single core performance.,he probably won't be able to find a big difference!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so a 12600,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in this generation, i do understand to an extent because of the new memory platform and pcie spec kind of needing a new chipset and pinout",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"by looking at various benchmarks, comparing them to my own benchmarks, and making educated guesses.","from the few benches i've seen of ryzen 7000 and raptor lake, so far it looks as though most of these upcoming cpus will *easily* double the single core performance of my current i5-4670k.","as soon as official benchmarks come out (and assuming that i'm right), i'm building a new pc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"more than likely not, but waiting a month to get what's essentially a 12600k for the cost of a 12400 is worth it imo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12600 doesn't have e cores,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
appreciate your response.,i'm going to look more into this evaluation method.,"if i may ask, do you have a rule of thumb for video cards?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m surprised to hear you say that ryzen 7000 will be double your intel 4th gen. i upgraded from a i7-4790k @ 4.4ghz to a r5-5600x @ 4.6ghz and (according to benchmarks) thatâ€™s almost exactly a +50% increase.,i guess the your i5 has a lower peak frequency and ryzen 7000 has the ipc+frequency improvements making up the difference?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"honestly, i think your rule is too rigid

it was a good rule in the '90s and the early 2000's, but not anymore imho, because it's completely ignores the importance of the multicore performance

i mean, even in 2017 it was time to upgrade from a 4th gen i5 for someone who wanted to play the latest games - switch from a 4670k to an 8700k should have been a reasonable, noticable upgrade five years ago - but if you are only playing older games, then, well, any upgrade is kinda pointless",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not if they increase the prices according to some rumors.,the price will probably be closer to 230-250 than 200 like with 12400. so i guess slightly discounted 12600k without overclocking?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intelâ€¦where do we know from that the 13400 will have e-cores?,not that i wouldnâ€™t disable them anyway and use windows 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's a little different for gpus since these days games rely on them more than ever (which means that you need as much gpu power as you can get), so i have a slightly different ruleset, one you might be bored with because i'm rather certain that your average person already shops this way:

1. never buy first gen (or even 2nd gen) tech cause you will be disappointed by it.",which is why i skipped rtx 2000 and 3000; i don't want ray tracing until i can have it in 4k and average 90-120+ fps (and so far it looks like the 16gb 4080 might be able to pull it off; 4090 definitely will be able to).,"2. always skip at least 1 gen before upgrading, to save money, if nothing else.",i usually skip 2.,"3. get the most powerful gpu you can afford, without spending just to spend.",pay attention to price:performance.,"a 4090 would be nice to have (cause like i said, you need as much gpu power you can get), but if it costs $2000, while the 16gb 4080 is half as much and has 75-80% the performance, then it makes the most logical sense to take the performance hit to save money (unless of course money isn't an issue, in which case i would just buy the most powerful gpu i could get).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm speaking strictly about single-threaded performance here, not just overall performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you make good sense and i think i needed to get some of this feedback.,"like you said, upgrading just for the sake of it.",thanks again!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"my old 7700k is crashing above 4ghz (and lc is leaking :d, fans are failing etc ) but the 13th gen should be available in a month form now, so it seems that this is not a big deal to wait.","getting new parts and preparing fresh os with all software and tuning is a couble days, so i would say that it is better to wait till october 20.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no point in upgrading at all; your cpu is too new and powerful.,"if you're having stability issues, reduce your overclock.",you're driving your already powerful chip too hard.,give it a break already.,wait for the 15900k or the 16900k; by then cpus will have gotten powerful enough to justify the purchase price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

your instability seems to come from your ram.,many 10900ks can't run 4400 mhz on the ram at safe system agent voltages.,lower system agent to1.20v and your ram clocks accordingly to 4100 to 4200 mhz.,high ram voltages e.g.,1.40 v and above also lead to hit ram which can become unstable of 40 - 45 c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

high speed ram becomes unstable at lower temperatures.,xmp should tolerate temps more than manually overclocked ram where it may not be stable at 40c anymore.,i wonder if you have tested with testmem5 or similar if your ram maintains stability when gpu+cpu are heating the case.,i recommend testing even if you are just using xmp.,cyberpunk 2077 at high framerates for example can heat up ram more than memory test program alone so may need to add furmark etc running too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i know maxsun isn't, i just found a website they seem to be a reputable chinese brand but i'm still digging around on the cpu side of things.",because i couldn't imagine a established company trying to scam while sending you there brand of motherboard.,edit: i sent them a email on the main website and ali-express,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, itâ€™s technically better than the 12400f - it has the clock speeds of the 12500, which makes it 4.6ghz vs 4.4ghz turbo boost, but the 12600 is still the top model in that line at 4.8ghz.","regardless, it does have that 2mb larger cache than any of those making it somewhat of an oddity.","performance versus the 12400f isnâ€™t really any noticeable improvement worth the cost, though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"see my edit, just found out that this exists.","sry, it looked kinda weird",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think i'm going to pull the trigger and get this and that weird gpu the amd rx 6600m.,apparently it's the mobile chip put on a rx 6000 pcb or some weird crap.,"but i seen it as low as 190 us dollars and apparently it performs close to the 6600. i'm  also thinking about getting some no name ram, just to cobble together a weird pc and see how it does.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how does it have extra cache?,is there physically 20 on the die but everything else is binned down?,or is this an entirely different die of which most is disabled?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
milky yellows are the best haha i also have some weird frog switches that are alright but the yellows are just it lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just found out that it basically a 12600k with some cores chopped off.,so 6 core 12 thread its supposed to be china's gaming cpu.,apparently it isn't anything like the 12400 except the core and thread count.,"i'm debating on getting it just because, i'm just nervous that since i'm in the us the drivers won't work.","edit: idk what it is because different sources say different things, if someone can tell me it will work in the us i'll buy it .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
found out from miyconst?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do it and please let me know.,i have a laptop with the 6800m in it and the thing is a beast of a gpu.,i would love to know if they have unlocked power limits or set higher ones because the card rarely gets too hot and that's on a laptop with i think a 180w limit!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was under the impression the rx6500 and rx6400 desktop parts were essentially mobile gpus as well.,"anyhow, couple other tidbits about the 12490f - it does not include a stock cooler, and itâ€™s always based on the 8+8 alder lake die, because the smaller 6+0 die only has 18mb cache maximum.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just curious as to *why* you go out of your way to buy parts that don't even make sense to import?,just seems like a waste of time and money to me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i like your attitude!,"bonus points if you run a bsd operating system on it, just to stay really weird.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"itâ€™s the alder lake 8+8 die (so any e-core model) with 2 p-cores, all 8 e-cores, and the igpu disabled.","that die normally has 10 x 3mb cache (up to 30mb total), but for the 12490f instead of going with 6 x 3mb (18mb) they went with 10 x 2mb (20mb) with each cache slice active but with banks disabled.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
managed to snag a kbd67lr4 and the milky yellows on a polycarbonate plate are just... top tier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"before you buy it, ask them for the chipset drivers and if it'll work ok win 10/11",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6800m gang!,"from what i could gather, it's pretty much a ps5 gpu in laptop form: 16.5% less memory bandwidth, but 11.1% more shaders/compute units which shakes out to 12.2tflops for the 6800m and 10.3tf for the ps5 gpu.",of course the 6800m is limited to 145w whereas the ps5 can pull up to 180w so after all's said and done i'd call them just about even stevens.,"sorry, sorta adhd'd out there ðÿ˜…",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah your right, but i'm into that kind of stuff.","no hate whatsoever i just like getting random stuff that makes no sense, it's something i've always enjoyed.",that's the exact reason why i have so many cheap mechanical keyboards because i could buy one 150 dollar keyboard or twenty 30 dollar keyboards lol i'm weird i know!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"per the title, they like buying random stuff.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you lol and i can't lie that would be interesting but i'm a windows fan lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
huh.,"if theyâ€™re doing 3x10 and binning it in those slightly weird ways, that almost suggests that they have a really low yield on that process.",unless itâ€™s purely a commercial decision.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's pretty sick!,"i'm the other end of the spectrum, i appreciate high end boards but i'm a sucker for making some cheap board sound almost as good.",i probably have around 8 cheap boards i've done various mods to lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i went ahead and emailed them but i'll see if i actually get a response,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
haha you are weird af.,"but when you get the system, i'd be interested to see how it performs and compares with standard intel/amd systems ðÿ˜„

i too shop for weird things on aliexpress.",but a whole system?,too much $$$.,"i'll leave that to you the ltt wishbone builds, lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think tomâ€™s hardware decided it was only released in china because there arenâ€™t many c0 dies that have 6 perfect p-cores that clocked high but literally nothing else good enough to be otherwise binned higher.,"both dies are normally used to build lower end models, like the 12400f, but by bumping the cache they restricted their options.","in all honesty, i donâ€™t know what the motivation behind this model is.",itâ€™s like just trying to manufacture a new part for the sake of saying they could.,then how about an 8+0 chip?,or a 4+4?,i do kind of wonder what a 6 core + 30mb cache model would perform like.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
howâ€™s the experience?,iâ€™ve built some higher end boards myself and wanna try and build a 100 dollar board,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not gonna lie i'm very surprised by what that cheaper board can do, only the spacebar is a bit hollow and loud",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

nooo they're retiring the pentium and celeron naming.,why intel why,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sigh... as if it wasn't already confusing enough.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"apparently across the world, something like 40% of people thought that pentium was the top tier, etc.",things like that... shrug.,5+ years from now we'll bring it back cause nostalgia lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably a stretch to say that 100%.,looks like it only applies to the mobile offerings of their 2023 portfolio.,"""the new offering will replace the intel pentiumâ® and intel celeronâ® branding in the 2023 notebook product stack.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i hope intel release the last pentium with overclock feature.,something like the anni version.,one last ride.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel's equivalent for servers/workstations is xeon.,"i think the next generation (sapphire rapids) is supposed to come out in q1 2023, but i don't know how confident that date is, as there have been some delays.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
xeons up to as many cores and treads as one can dream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sapphire rapids soon to be released,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"new desktop chips from intel are really fast:  
[https://www.cpubenchmark.net/singlethread.html](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/singlethread.html)

i think, something similar will happen in the server niche very soon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel also had epic, which were a failure of epyc proportions",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
should i wait for the next gen?,i was aiming to be up and running after christmas but if it's out shortly after that i will wait if there is much of a performance difference,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i can dream of 64 cores per cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
soon^tm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
â€žnicheâ€œ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is your use case?,"i know this is an intel sub, but amd epyc zen 4 will be much better than saphire rapids and there's also threadripper pro from amd.",doesn't make sense really to buy into saphire rapids unless you have the most niche use case of all time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they made a 124 core one a while ago but it was pretty slow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i think in modern lineups they donâ€˜t offer more than 32 (or was it 28?),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah it was a failure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean theyâ€˜re not too bad but amd just has more and better stuffðÿ¤·ðÿ»â€â™‚ï¸,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends what features you want cores and clocks arnt everything,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
release the a770 for fucks sake,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"knowing their drivers, itâ€™s probably best to let intel release it when they feel theyâ€™re ready.",thereâ€™s plenty of gpus in the market rn anyways,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"agreed, let them finish and release when ready no matter the time they need",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can probably find a scale that shows an improvement of 4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i wouldnâ€™t upgrade within the same generation, youâ€™ll get about 50% more multicore but gaming wonâ€™t improve much.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for gaming unless itâ€™s highly cpu bound probably no different.,for vm itâ€™s likely a bigger difference.,depending on what you are virtualizing you may need more cores than i5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
go for 10700f,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11600k or 11700k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"go to 12gen, the change will be like 30\~50%.","but for 10, there is not much diff.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it was never my intention to keep the i3.,it was just so i could switch sockets.,the i5 is my final/official cpu for this machine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my focus isnâ€™t gaming.,i value the high thread count very much.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
could i jump even further to the i9-10900f?,using a msi b560m-a pro mobo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the question should be, are you better off keeping the current board/proc together and selling them as a combo to buy a new b660 board or trying to upgrade an already old platform?","if you buy the new board, you can then take the funds set aside for the 10400f and purchase a 12400 or 12600k cpu, either of which is significantly faster at single and multi-core tasks than the 10400f, in addition to giving you a better long term upgrade path.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends how much you can get the 10400f for.,itâ€™s a decent buy at about $120.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"theoretically yes, but the vrm looks kinda weak on this board.","10700f would be more than enough and will last you for a decade, especially if you will upgrade your screen resolution in the future.","you can also try and update the bios and try to put 11700f , but for your case, i looked at the board website page and  the vrm doesn't look sufficient for 11th gen, plus the 10700/11700 gaming performance is on par.","the 11th is power hungry for no real reason, poor back porting by intel",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s 500 series so 11th gen cpus are supported out of the box.,11400f maybe?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"11700f imo, 11400 is also great, and you'll notice a big difference, less frame drops, everything will be a lot smoother and effortless.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
plus you'll enjoy pcie4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think your best cpu for a r430 is the e5-2640v4.,"90w tdp and allows for slightly faster memory than the v3 cpus, very slightly more power efficient.",r430s cooling is not as good a r630 or the 2u r730s so i would keep to the lower tdp processors.,before the upgrade make sure you install the latest bios so you know it will work with v4 cpus.,i would also populate the 2nd cpu for esxi.,16gb dimms are still the sweet spot for memory but 32gb is not nearly as expensive as it was even 6 months ago.,"less dimms less power needed, something to think about when  running at home 24x7.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you need to override the fan settings the latest bios prevents you from doing that over ipmi.,where are you planning on running the server at home?,will it be in a place in which the amount of noise that the server will make could prevent you from running it there?,going with a 2u server is typically going to be much quieter as the same amount of airflow can be accomplished through twice the height of the chassis.,the older 610's i'd sell fast as they are power hungry and slow.,limited pcie speeds for nvme and just not as nearly as good as 620 or 630's.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so i had a look at the v4s for this socket and i ended up finding a 2680v4 on bargainhardware (uk store, suits me as i don't have to wait 2-4 weeks for the shipping if i buy from aliexpress).",i will try that in the socket and see how it goes!,"power efficiency is of course something to think about but i'm not expecting it to be on 24/7 365. the server is actually very quiet when running, and theres an r330 at my work which i've heard are very quiet running machines - i'm picking that up on monday.","as for the other cpu, will i be able to run dual mismatched cpus?",i tried to on one of the r610s but it didn't like it and refused to boot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is it worth selling the 610s?,i can see online they only sell for around â£20 which seems more hassle than its worth.,"i was thinking that i could use them as spare part machines, but not too sure",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hard to say.,but you could ask a tax advisor if you would benefit by donating them and taking a deduction but that depends where you are and tax laws and at least for me if i benefit from itemizing deductions over standard deductions then it could be beneficial.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would you be able to explain a bit more?,i've honestly never heard of that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in the united states here's the main page about deductions.,https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-provides-tax-inflation-adjustments-for-tax-year-2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah i see, i am from the uk so not sure this applies",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you could find a nonprofit that needs a server that doesn't have any money.,if it's a good nonprofit i'd also recommend helping their i.t.,getting it installed as usually their skills are lacking.,"pay it forward, it'll come back if that's of concern to you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"good point, i would definitely consider doing that.",however this is a server from my current place of work so i'm not sure how they would feel about me giving away decommed hardware?,i was permitted to take it and they were going to be disposed of but i'm not too sure on the protocols surrounding that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you use the dban and wipe stuff they will probably be okay with it but i would still double check because you never want to do something you are not allowed to do with decommissioned hardware.,also it may look good to your employer that you want to give it to a nonprofit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thats a fair point.,"as far as i know its not against the policy because the engineer has removed it from the index, meaning its no longer company property.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"power settings, try adjusting to balanced or energy saver and back to see if idle clocks self adjust.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends heavily on your foreseen workload.,"you need a combination of high clockspeed, good ipc and single threaded performance.","these items, alongside a good memory subsystem (high speed, low latency ddr4/5 memory, nvme disks etc) is what actually makes your pc feel ""snappy"" or ""instantaneous"".","more cores give you better performance at tasks that require more processing cores (rendering, etc) but doesn't make your overall windows experience better just for having more cores.","as said above, money is better spent trying to build a good balanced system, than trying to have the most cores possible but wimpy system components.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's not only about speed or cores, ipc (intructions per clock) matter too.",you need to look a benchmark to see the real difference between 2 cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there are two types of performance:
single-threaded: roughly boost clock * ipc

multithreaded: roughly (boost clock - 0.4 ghz) * core count * ipc (though this only applies for intel big cores, it gets weird outside of that).","intel has made massive ipc and clock speed gains since broadwell (their 5th generation), and it turns out that the xeon youâ€™re considering is [about an i5-12600k in multicore](https://www.cpu-monkey.com/en/compare_cpu-intel_xeon_e5_2699_v4-vs-intel_core_i5_12600k), and gets stomped by the entire 12th-gen lineup in single-threaded tests (and, for that matter, gaming too), with not even half their single-threaded performance.","oh, and the i5-12600k is a $250 chip.","this is why getting old high-end chips is usually a bad decision: theyâ€™ll be horrible for gaming and single-core workloads anyway, and theyâ€™re never cheap enough to compare well against new generations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cpu frequency is one aspect of performance.,ipc (instructions per clock or cycle) and cache can also play a major role in performance.,that's largely why a 12700k mildly oc'd to 5.0ghz all p-cores will absolutely shit on a 8700k oc'd to 5ghz all core in single core score despite being set at the same frequency.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 5950x would wipe the floor against that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"some applications scale better with more threads, additional threads also help with multitasking.","higher clock speeds can boost the performance of applications that use only a few threads, such as gaming.","it's also important to note that different generations of cpu also have efficiency differences, so a newer cpu of the same core count and clock speed is typically faster than an older cpu of the same core count and clock speed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks for your reply, it was the response i didn't know i needed.",i should mention now that the device purpose isn't general computing.,"its purpose is for cad, 3d printing but mostly photogrammetry which is why i am thinking dual cpu and also possible multiple graphics cards.",how can i build a balanced system around those constraints?,"i'm thinking intel xeon e5 2699 cpu x 2 4tb ssd, not sure what else after that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i recommend cpubenchmark.net,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i asked you the other day how many cores that workload can use?,"you really want to get that many and then after that try to get the highest clock speed, enough memory, etc.",buying 64 slower cores for a workload that only uses 6-7 will result in a worse system than if you'd bought 8 cores with a higher clock speed.,"additionally, as your workload scales to more cores, you typically need more memory, so make sure you have enough to use as many cores as you can.","the xeon e5 2699 is a a couple different possible cpus, but they're at least 6-8 year old and largely obsolete.",you probably want to buy something faster.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you doing anything that needs more than that?,guessing youâ€™re not gaming with that quadro?,would you want it going into turbo boost when youâ€™re idling?,what are your cpu temps under load?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"all core boost for 12700 is 4.5ghz, 4.9ghz is one core boost.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"use cpu-z to monitor core frequency, task manager is garbage.","use benchmarks to determine if you're lacking performance, don't look at clock frequencies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"unrelated, how did you get your task manager to look like that?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you disabled the power limits in bios?,"the 12700 will lock itself to 65w power consumption long term under heavy load, which doesnâ€™t allow for high speeds.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
does xtu show any type of throttling active under load?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in windows under ""power"" make sure ""performance"" profile is selected.",maybe battery saver or something is active.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm using the cpu's for stock trading software with multiple monitors.,when it only boosts to 2.1ghz the software stutters during high volume trade.,cpu temps are fine with max around 50-55 degrees celcius.,i'm using dark rock tf2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
isn't call core boost for 12700 is 4.8?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
aready used hwmonitor by cpuid.,i don't measure frequency by task manager.,my problem as the cpu is stuck on base frequency and not turbo boosting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"windows 11 preview, new task manager",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,power limit are disabled.,i set up originally with power limited of pl1 65w and pl2 180w on bios and it was boosting fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no it does not.,"just updating, apparently there was a driver corruption.",i reinstalled the intel management engine from biostar support website and it's back to normal now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,power profile is already high performance profile.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, itâ€™s 4.5ghz all core.",the 12700k gets 4.7ghz.,4.8ghz is the maximum single/dual core boost speed.,specific favored cores might reach 4.9ghz on certain light single threaded loads if the tbm 3.0 feature is enabled and working.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#benchmarks!!!,where are they?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
calm down batman,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah.. you can throw pcie cards all around the slots ... some mobos with x8 even have the end open to fit x16 cards ... its the standard.. so you are good .. i have my x1 wifi card also in a x8 slot ...

to fully utilize 6e you would also need a 6e capable router - and they cost a fat buck ... with 5ghz there is a big drop if you add walls to the path, but still its better than 2.4ghz in terms of latency ... so you really need to test your setup in your house to see how it will behave ... and one of my personal experience is, that i couldnt get over 540mbit per client anyways ... 

(consider also some mesh routers, big antennas mean better signal :-d)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes you can put a 1x card in a 16x pcie slot no problem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, you can use those x16 slots.",and guess what - neither of them are actually x16.,"one is x4 and the other is x1, just like the tiny slot.",they just put full size physical slots in for your convenience.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you broke something when you messed with it.,maybe a clogged aio pump?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the new position should have a dust filter, which would increase restriction on the radiator air flow.","i seriously doubt it would alone cause the temp increase you're seeing, but could be worth removing and testing again if you haven't already.","also, did you rotate the aio block when you changed the rad position?",i could be that the shape of the cold plate and the channels inside aren't as efficient when rotated relative to the longer rectangular ihs of 12th gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"aio on the top pushing air out, front fans sucking air in, back fans pushing air out, bottom fans sucking air,

here is an update.,"i croaked and forked over another lian li galahad 360. 
installed it today and these are the results:

can't imagine what.,i usually build with every precaution.,"not banging, bending or scratchings stuff.tubing never bent beyond any slight resistance when fitting.cold plate is still shiny and unscratched.",and i cant tell if its clogged or not without dissasembly.,atleast 1 tube is warm while the other is cold.,so there is a circulation going on.,"edit:  
the only thing i can think off is to lower the tdp to 165watt like in the before situation, since the tdp suddenly went higher.",if the temps are the same then thats that.,"only, my oppinion still stands.",a 360 rad should be able to cool a 12700k on 178watt much lower then what mine is doing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
canâ€™t really make heads nor tails what position the flow will be from pictures alone.,"and since the head turns around as well, which side will make a difference?",once i get home iâ€™ll test different rotations.,also your point of dust filters is a good one.,i already removed them once to check temps.,probably made around 1 degree difference.,also ambient temps inside donâ€™t feel that hot/warm.,so maybe heat isnâ€™t dissipated well enough through the rad.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yup.,"but in an force enclosure, thermals act a bit different.",so with sucking air in fromt top and bottom i made air meet half way on the allminum plate and it sucked out through front.,used smoke to see the flow.,but none of that matter now.,"situation now is, air sucking front (side, since my case has the front on the side) and sucking air bottom.",only top is exhaust.,"added a picture in the post, hopefully makes more sense of the current situation(and yes the tubes are top, but also tubes bottom made no difference in temp and this was cleaner to install for this testing round as the rad now sits against the backplate flush for better suction of outside cold air).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>atleast 1 tube is warm while the other is cold.,so there is a circulation going on.,actually it's bad if the delta between both tubes is too extreme.,"flick the cold tube lightly with the back of your finger, and if temps drop (you're forcing the water to flow), you know it's the pump.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ll check that once i come home.,good point as i havenâ€™t really stood still at the difference.,thanks!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

personally i don't think big/little should even be a concept on desktop.,"if the e-cores were added as an extra, like say instead of a 16c/32t cpu it was instead a 16c/16e, then i'd see them as much more useful, as logical cores do have degraded performance in cases like gaming.. but i believe they're still better than e-cores in productivity applications regardless, so it's still a net loss.","either way, their point was mainly power savings in small form factor devices.. and on a desktop you aren't restricted by that in any way.",also it doesn't help the windows scheduler (and tons of other things) are complete garbage.,equally being forced to run the absolute latest version of windows just for things to work remotely properly because programmers don't want to backport things anymore.,i still remember the amd dual core optimizer..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
literally responding to a comment about why microsoft chose a specific design.,"they did it because it's focused on user experience, not performance.","it's an interactive operating system, linux is meant to run heavy tasks.",design philosophies are different.,"i didn't say one was better than the other, depends on what you're doing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i agree with you.,still i traded my 10850k (10-core) to 12700k (8+4) and it was a big improvement.,i'd rather have a 10-(p)core 12th gen cpu but it is what it is.,12th gen e+p works well now in recent linux kernels.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">either way, their point was mainly power savings in small form factor devices.. and on a desktop you aren't restricted by that in any way.",they wanted to beat amd in multitasking.that's the real reason.,i don't like e-cores either.i wish we would have gotten a cpu with more actual p-cores with a higher clock/cache.,mainly speaking as someone who likes to build high performance gaming pc's.,to me these e-cores are just another factor that muddies the waters  and too many people are involved in getting them to work properly.,"(intel,microsoft,game devs) and to this day i still keep hearing people having issues with them in games.",like you said they should never have been introduced to actual desktop level cpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and itâ€™s just stupid.,windows scheduler is already perfectly capable of scheduling multiple applications on a single core.,"just give the foreground application some priority so it stays responsive, there is no need to prevent background application from using the cores.",i guess the application itself can technically fix this but you canâ€™t expect everyone who writes e.g.,scientific code to use some windows scheduling api.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you know if there's a big difference from 10th to 11th gen?,i acquired a 11900k which apparently runs very hot but some say that it makes a big improvement (as some benchmarks show) but other people and stuff say its not?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, 11th gen was the worst gen. single-core speed is arguably slightly faster than 10th gen, but the cores are very hot and for the highest sku (11900k vs 10900k) it goes back to 8 cores (from 10 cores).","for multithreaded tasks, 11gen is not faster than 10th gen.

12th gen is faster all over the place.","8 p-cores of the 12th gen will easilly outperform 10 p-cores of 10th gen (and then some, and then you have the e-cores even as 'bonus')",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, that is what i intend to test: the temperatures, some tests show it being almost 20c hotter than the 11700k.","i can't go 12th gen as that would require a new cooler and a new board, whilst the one i have (and want) the 12th gen is almost 120 more expensive on average, whilst i got the current one at a great 50% off sale.",i usually only play old(er) games and new games in 4k so the difference from 11th gen to 12th gen shouldn't be that noticeable ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"temperature depends fully on the set tdp  (pl1 and pl2), and you are fully in control of that in bios.","so you simply cant say, '11th gen is hotter than 10th gen'.","you can only say, '12th gen is faster than 10th gen for a given tdp'.","if you have a fast 10th gen, 10700k or better, i don't think there is need to upgrade right now.",except if you 'want' to (like me) but you have to admit it is a huge waste of money to upgrade only 1 or 2 (or 3) generations.,"'upgrading' from 10th to 11th is a complete waste, as it is more of a 'side-grade' than an 'upgrade'.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no doubt!,"i am upgrading from a 4790k, one of main reasons is that in warhammer 3 per example all fps is fine but once animations start/things that take use of the ram/cpu it starts crashing the fps and graphic settings barely have an impact on it (though playing on 3840x1600 or something, on lower resolutions the fps is horrible, so it could be the blame of the cpu?).","i saw in one benchmark on stock speeds the 11900 going 20c higher than the 11700, should i try that one if the 11900 gets too hot?","my aim is the highest clock speed possible on one to two, maximum 4 cores and it seemed 11900 was best for that?",12th gen is just a bit out of my price reach due to then having to get a new cooler/motherboard then too.,"my 4790 got really hot as well, up to almost 90c on warhammer 3 with a h110 watercooler with 2 industrial fans (noctua) i think i did years ago undervolting whilst it still ran at 4ghz but i think i stopped that when i read it could impact performance?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you purchase any non-k cpu, itâ´s not going to be super hot.",the non-k will have 95w pl1 and only 65w pl2.,"so, sure, for gaming you could get a 10700 or 11700.  both 8-core cpu's so they should serve you well into the future.","if you get a z490 or z590 board, you can always set a higher tdp if your cooler can handle it, to get more performance.",you can set it to the defaults of a 'k' cpu pl1=200w and pl2=125w to get that performance and heat.,is a 12400 and b660 board with ddr4 really too expensive compared to 10700?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"welp, this didn't exactly help settle the arc rumours, mlid specifically focused on discrete gpu's for gaming etc being cancelled going down the line ( which looking at the market, kind of makes sense tbh) but when tom was asked, ooo what do you think of these rumours, immediately went into talking about data centre etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the real arc was the friends we made along the way,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is probably game dependent.,which is why you typically see driver updates whenever a big aaa comes out.,as they tend to be the ones that are really pushing the gpu performance requirements.,"basically while many games will work with existing drivers without any modification, but to get the best performance, the gpu companies will have to work with the game developers to optimize the drivers/code.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they're making new cpus, same as they always do.",i also assume they're only going to be answering questions on their field (gpus).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not officially canceled.,"unfortunately intel digs the hole deeper with their cagey responses which don't really have any concrete launch info, and there have been setbacks which delayed the launch a few times.",and we still don't know which gpu vendors are going to be launch partners.,"this is expected because they want to get it right for the rest of the lineup, but it doesn't help that the a380's performance isn't really matching up to the rx 6400/6500 tier in early reviews.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i would say they're definitely just untrue rumours, and seeing mlid get on the bandwagon tells me that it's almost definitely untrue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not cancled.,mlid is trash.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
from what he says: arc alchemist is still going to ship as planned.,cancellation of arc isn't going to change the a770/a750/a580/etc cards.,there might still be low end battlemage discreet cards and laptop battlemage.,integrated gpus will keep using xe graphics ip.,axg isn't going anywhere.,datacenter and hpc focused cards are not going anywhere.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
people long before mlid were speculating the project would or at least could be cancelled.,"a late, high r&d, poor performing project will often get cancelled, that's life.","the main thing is people seem to be thinking that intel will just cancel it and sit on 100s of millions, maybe billions in dollars of stock in warehouses by cancelling very publicly and not intend to launch those cards.","if they cancel or not i'd expect these cards to launch, intel will try to make as much cash as they can by selling the cards they and their aibs have and then cancel the project at some point between then and when battlemage should be going into production.",now if it turns out a770 has a truly critical error that means they have an insanely large stockpile of essentially useless silicon then they could cancel before launch because they'd be fucked either way.,"with rumours that aibs have been stockpiling for months, are bemused/pissed at lack of launch ad also rumoured to have stopped production.","combine this with amd/nvidia new gens edging ever closer and underperforming cards looking worse all the time, them not rushing to market with already produced cards is very very strange.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i never watched this channel but this exact video about arcs cancellation popped up on my recommendations so i watched.,i still wasnâ€™t convinced that it was 100% true it seemed like a possibility.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
watch tom's response in the video.,"people, including mlid and that wannabe analyst jon peddie, don't realize that gpu ip is very much shared across product lines.","if you have a good gpu, you sell it into data center, hpc, and consumer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""seemed like a possibility""

that's how he lies to you and gets more viewers, laughing all the way to the bank.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> **if** you have a good gpu

tom responding to such a video is irrelevant.","a coporation or someone speaking for one is telling you what they want you to hear, not the truth.",they can be the same things but are frequently not.,"until a decision is made and an announcement date picked then a corporation won't even entertain the idea of failure publicly because if they talk about maybe cancelling then didn't want to, they've already massively damaged any confidence in the product.","absolutely everyone knows that gpu ip is shared across product lines as well, literally everyone.","it's not a good ip, at least yet.","it's exceptionally uncompetitive, it's using realistically over double the die size to be competitive with amd and nvidia.",that makes it power inefficient and max performance is dire.,"the two things data centre and hpc want is power efficiency and the most power they can get into a rack, intel is failing miserably on those two metrics.","a consumer won't care that intel is selling them a 6900xt sized gpu at a rx6400 price, but anyone wanting a 6700-6900xt class gpu can't get it from intel and intel don't want to sell large gpus at such prices either.",that's why everyone is talking about if intel is so far behind they can realistically catch up and make profits within the next 3-4 generations and if not they can very realistically just cancel the project now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tom is a marketing mouthpiece.,look at their actions and not their words.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
apparently you don't know even though you claim to.,same with mlid.,"look at what ponte vecchio and flex series are offering, and they share ip but not necessarily same die with ponte vecchio.","yea, maybe intel made some mistakes on 1st gen consumer.",they know it and said they will sell cheap.,doesn't change the reality of the business which you still don't grasp even though tom literally told you in the video that your position is totally illogical.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"again, what tom says is literally irrelevant, a mouth piece for a company tells you what they want you to hear, nothing more or less.","second, ponte vecchio offers something sure, but that doesn't automatically mean it's enough.","their numbers are their numbers, for an unreleased product you can't buy.","it's faster (in theory, according to them, if they can release it and they don't have to reduce performance for power reasons) than a 2 year old nvidia product.","nvidia will bring new products soon, it's slower than mi250 and mi300 is making claims that will potentially absolutely destroy ponte vecchio.",that's multiple major issues.,intel is 2 years late with everything and still aren't releasing the chips that are apparently stockpiled which indicates major driver or silicon issues.,either bodes poorly for ponte vecchio.,"intel is offering best case numbers and scenario when everything so far has been worst case numbers and scenario when it comes to reality of launches, delays, production issues, drivers and ultimately performance.","also again it's largely irrelevant if ponte vecchio is say 2.5x faster than nvidia's current best if it launches after nvidia launch something new and ultimately if nvidia and amd crush ponte vecchio in performance/watt, it's over.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sorry you don't get it and have been brainwashed by mlid's falsehoods, who surely knows most about how the business works.","he's clearly being lied to, or is making shit up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i haven't watch the video nor know what he said, but i can have a rough idea because a lot of people have been speculating on if their project can go ahead at this point.",5 years in and billions of dollars down the drain and still adding delays with signs of aibs being frustrated with the situation is not normal.,"you've yet to offer a reason intel can't fail, you're just parroting that a intel man says everything is great therefore it must be.",which is laughably worse than criticising mlid even if i cared to watch a youtubers shitty videos on speculation because tom's opinion is literally by definition paid for and biased towards intel and you're taking it at face value with no further critical thinking at all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and you keep drinking that intel koolaid bro.,mlid is often wrong.,but still not as much as intel has been lying and delaying.,why the fuck should anyone trust what intel has to say at this point?,fanboying a company is cringe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why would you expect av1 encoding on an igp?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

most people aren't encoding in av1.,honestly hevc is good enough for me.,most people encoding a lot of av1 will likely have a dedicated gpu that can do it.,in theory the arc gpu encoded av1 very well.,av1 hw decoding is good enough for most people.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nvidia 40-series has av1 encode.,"rdna 3 probably will too, but not yet confirmed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably because intel traditionally has very good encoders in their igpus and are going to also include av1 in the future.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
raw power has nothing to do with av1 encoding support.,the whole point of the igps in the desktop chips *is* the media engine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

according to the current market price, 5600x is about $70 cheaper than 12600k, its the single-thread performance is about 20% lower, but the multi-thread performance is about 30% lower, so it depends on whether you are willing to spend an extra $70 to buy the 12600k, if not , just buy 5600x.","also, the 5700x is completely unnecessary as its multi-threaded performance is not as high as the 12600k and its single-thread performance (gaming performance) is even a bit worse than the 5600x.","so, choose between 5600x and 12600k depending on if you wish to spend the extra 70 dollars.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i do want to be able to do at least light gaming and the occasional video editing, and i'm also worried about the battery life difference.",1260p has efficiency cores which i assume means not being as power intensive unless it's called for.,it's also that it'll be my only computer for a year and i don't want to be underserved for whatever might come my way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"no , i mean,  in this particular case if you are testing a budget setup, test a 12100 with a rx 6600 or a rtx 3060 and am sure is gonna be pointless anyway because it will be no meaningful  diference between ddr4 3200 and ddr5 4800",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because difference is meaningless for budget build which is freaking title in the video.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"informative video, and it is appreciated, but it doesn't really make sense.",they start off by stating the price difference in motherboard and ram is about $60 more than ddr4 equivalent.,"while that may not seem like much, that's nearly the difference between a 12100 and a 12400.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you donâ€™t have a pc at all right now i would rather buy ddr5 because the next time you do a full system upgrade you definitely wonâ€™t be on ddr4.,the cheap stuff isnâ€™t the best right now but itâ€™s not noticeably different in most cases than cheap ddr4.,if you bite the extra bullet now you donâ€™t *have* to buy ram again until ddr6 is standard.,obviously anybody that already owns ddr4 shouldnâ€™t be looking to upgrade at this time unless youâ€™ve got money to blow.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there are many lowendgamers / lowspecgamers running on athlon 3000g/3200g/3400g.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the point is to test if the cpu is impacted by the memory.,by using a low end gpu both the cpu and the memory are taken out of the equation and it becomes a gpu benchmark.,this is why i asked if you're new to benchmarking because people keep bringing this point up as if the reviewers are stupid while missing the point of the test.,"if you are testing one component, every other needs to be the best available, otherwise the test is invalid.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"> if you bite the extra bullet now you donâ€™t have to buy ram again until ddr6 is standard


well you dont have to upgrade 12100 either, i recon for low-mid range gaming it will serve 4+ years easy, your argument that you wont have to buy new ram is flawed because ~3-5 years later even ddr5 will be completely different, compatibility standards, capacity, speed, latency and price.","most people who had very early ddr4 variants for their skylake/kabylake platforms have upgraded either both, cpu and ram or bought everything new, because by staying with those early 2133-2400mhz ram modules, you leave a lot of performance on the table, its just unpractical.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the cheap ddr5 right now being suggested is roughly akin to have bought ddr4 2400 2x4gb (yes only 8gb in total).,how long would you have been fine with carrying that forward for during ddr4's lifespan?,in terms of expensive ddr5 the issue prices tend to drop the fastest as well during the early adopter phase.,you know ddr4 3200c16 that we treat as budget ddr4 nowadays?,that at launch was several times the price of 2400 kits.,"for all we know high priced ddr5 drops in half just by the end of 2023. 

this is why the future proofing concept is not that clear cut due to how deflationary a lot of tech products end up being.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
his question in this budget test has a point.,"if you are going to make a budget build following this benchmarks but end up buying a 6600 or a 3050 if you benchmarks all those rams with low end gpu there won't be any different, making all the information you took from the video irrelevant.","i had friends that had bought 5800x3d and asking me were are the 10% - 20% fps gains from their ""old"" 5800x and they didn't get any gains because one was using a 3060 and the other a 6600xt.","most benchmarks of cpu, ram are done with the top tier gpu of that time and people don't understand benchmarks and think that they will get the same gains of performance using low end gpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"true , hub made a good job , maybe i only have to skip this particular  review because im not interest , instead of complain about it , i play a few games but am not a gamer , so i didnt care about getting 10 fps because of the ram, i wait for the new cpu review later this month .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you at least have a kit thatâ€™s usable on future platforms though, same cannot be said buying ddr4.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes iâ€™m aware.,but that cheap ddr5 is also roughly the same performance as 3200 cl 16. you will never use ddr4 again and you can overclock these cheap kits.,also an extra $10 or so will get you a 5200 mhz kit.,itâ€™s ok to have different opinions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"people not understanding is their personal problem, especially if all they do is look at the graphs and ignore the commentary.","benchmarks aren't meant to simulate an entire build, they are to test a specific component and the responsibility is on the reader/viewer to piece the information together by looking at multiple test results and seeing how their personal build would perform.","if they are too stupid to do that then again, that's their problem.",the test methodology is perfectly fine and has been the industry standard for decades.,changing it for the internet's lowest common intellectual denominator makes zero sense.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's entirely their fault for not understanding what their system's bottlenecks are.,not using the strongest for other components in a benchmark to rule out bottlenecks that'll affect testing data is stupid.,there's an extremely good reason why any reputable tester does it this way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd avoid getting g.skills's 5600/6000 c36 or c40 ram kits because of all the reports of instability specifically on those kits.,"if you really like the design of those kits, go for their c28/c30 bins which are hynix, or just buy from an alternative brand and save the cash.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd say it depends on the prices.,from where will you buy?,do you just want what's best for the money or do you want value for your money?,do you care about the aesthetics of the ram?,most likely the best choice will be to find a ram kit that is on sale.,32 gb ram is more than plenty for anyone who doesn't do heavy workload tasks.,"hell even 16 gb is, but imo if buying now might as well go for 32 gb as some newer games sometimes are pushing the ram",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

use corsair vengeance or dominator platinum or use kingston fury beast for your build i myself i use corsair vengeance ram i have that kind in mine even though i have ddr4 being the sddm or 128gb and being that in 4 sticks of 32gb at 2666mhz i have that brand in my laptop that is a special edition asus rog mother ship laptop tablet and i swapped out the stock for that kind and the thing runs so fast that the games have no lag and it boots in 8 seconds so if i was you use corsair vengeance ram cause it is the best one out there for fast speeds and for hard core gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
here's a [review from march](https://babeltechreviews.com/fast-ram-makes-a-difference-in-gaming-6-kits-30-games/) that compares 5 ddr5 kits including the g.skill trident z5 6000mhz cl36 and cl40 and corsair dominator 6400mhz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have never had issues with gskill.,that being said all high speed or oc'ed ddr5 is finicky on z690 motherboards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ye i also hard about this.,"can you give me an "" alternative brand of that"" ?",also with some rgb :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"nah, i just wanted 64 gb to fill 4 slots in motherboard",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so basically you recommend corsair dominator 5600 cl 36?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that was me until i bought three kits of trident z5 6000mhz cl36/40's.,all of them were horribly unstable ootb on my (then) z690 apex.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if you want to stick with g skill get the 6400cl32 kit.,it's hynix and even if you can't get those speeds you can run it at 6000 or 5600 with extremely tight timings.,plus as the imc improves with future cpus and better motherboards you can get it to 7000.  on good boards and good imcs - overclockers are getting those speeds right now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

could the low freq ddr4 be the problem?,the only reason i think you saw a difference is because of the overhauling of the entire system; not just the cpu.,"if one has the exact same specs as your new setup with the 9900k, moving to the 12900k would not benefit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

sounds like you are heavily gpu bound.,you need to be hitting 100fps+ to see much difference in cp2077 with a new cpu.,with current gpus at 4k+raytracing it is impossible right now unless you tweak your graphical settings heavily like dlss.,if you had infinite gpu power i think in some most heavily congested parts of the night city you would drop to 50-80 fps range with 11600k.,most of the time it would be good for 100fps+.,"so get a better cpu if you want, just don't expect miracles with maxed out settings.","[example with 12900k](https://youtu.be/be5lhg2ee9i?t=562)

"yeah, this sounds about right.",the vrm has reached its power capacity or gotten too hot.,an 8700k is probably a bit of an ask for a h310 board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think you're right with the motherboard voltage regulators - though interestingly whatever throttling is happening does not seem to limit the cpu performance or clock speed.,"i cannot find anything to suggest what voltage is ok.

however i tried dropping vcore to 1.15 and it bsod'd.",at 1.18 it seems stable and can run without triggering the same throttling message.,"i guess if i ran it for a long period it may still happen, but i'm guessing games are not going to have cpu at 100% all the time and generate the same heat and so it will probably be ok.

as a former console gamer trying to understand pcs any tips / advice is welcomed.","for example, if 1.18 is stable and allows stock clocks without overheating/throttling, i presume this will be fine for gaming / not cause issues?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't disagree; it's very old and i don't have the cash to change it at the moment.,but your comment is not helpful at all and has nothing to do with the question asked.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hello.,the case is clean (i dusted inside and used a air blower to help remove dust) yesterday.,"i have limited fan capability on my (not great) motherboard, but my two intake fans at the front are both running, my heatsink fan (which pulls air through the heatsink for the cpu cooling via a cooler master hyper 212) is running, and my exhaust fan at the back is running too.",i have now got what appears to be a stable vcore of 1.18 which allows the i7 to run at stock clocks.,"over a 3 hour avx stress test in xtu the cpu didn't go over 80â°c (it was in the high 70's) and there were no errors recorded over that period so i guess the heat on the mobo / voltage regulator was ok.

at 1.15 i had a bsod and at 1.2o the temperature got to 84â°c on the cpu and i had the externalvr throttled messages.",1.18 therefore seems to be the right balance.,do you know - does the vcore have any impact on gaming performance?,or would it only make a difference if the clock speed was impacted / overheated due to vcore changes?,"also, do you know how i might find out the maximum ""voltage regulator"" temperature for my motherboard?",i think overall this may be the best i can hope for until i can upgrade my case and therefore get better cooling.,"from what people have commented, it sounds like i need a better motherboard but it doesn't seem worth getting one for this cpu - i guess i should save for a newer gen cpu/mobo.",thank you for the link too.,i have read it through and am going to go through it again and check some windows settings and the other things mentioned to make sure i am not missing anything/can improve on the above.,cheers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah unfortunately my mobo is very old and parts have come to me and i've been trying to use them as best i can.,"i think the ""auto"" puts ways too much voltage through hence trying to get a stable undervolt.",my case is also too cramped which no doubt does not help.,i have put a 1.18 vcore and it seems stable and did not trigger the same message.,"i'm only gaming, so i don't know how long to run stress tests for - it seems doing hours and hours on end is a bit overkill as games don't use 100% cpu for that length of time.",any tips / advice welcome.,"i'm saving up to change my case, mobo and cpu in the not too distant future.",but it's expensive!!,!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my understanding is vcore provides stability with throwing more power at the cpu to maintain the clock speed.,thatâ€™s why you try to give it all the juice you can.,i wonder if the bios you are using has been updated.,sometimes that could be a culprit.,windows updates and driver updates expecting or being tuned to a more recent bios.,and also if changing the core has auto settings where it changes other settings for you or is it isolated.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"well, there are precedents, for example, intel wireless-ac 9260 only supported bluetooth 5.0 at launch but eventually ended getting bluetooth 5.1 via a driver update (or it was firmware?",can't remember).,"comparing the specs, bluetooth 5.3 apparently didn't change much on the hardware side in relation to version 5.2 (which ax200 and up already supports), so i think it's possible.","things might be different for the cnvi variants (ac 9462, ax201, ax211) as the chipset also plays a role there, but i wouldn't discard at least the non-cnvi variants possibly getting updated...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"thanks, more than enough info there.","* you have stock power limits enabled (202w short term, 65w long term), which means you are leaving a lot of your cpuâ€™s potential performance untapped.","* however, you are also thermal throttling with only 135 watts power draw, which is definitely not good.",could you describe your case and fan setup?,and is this a prebuilt or did you build it yourself?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think itâ€™s handling the 65w.,but itâ€™s not handling the stock 202w pl2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

\*\*edit 2 also i want to add that the cpu cooler has one fan preinstalled with the option to install a second fan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it doesnâ€™t have to.,that 200w load with stock settings would last around 10-15 seconds.,thatâ€™s assuming start from idle and immediate full load.,pl1 of 65w means the average heat output canâ€™t be over that.,coolers can absorb the peaks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i will check that this afternoon and report back,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"when gaming, 90% of the time is around 65w .",it peaks for a few seconds above that.,"when that happens (70-100w) , temp goes to crazy (90-100c)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i donâ€™t have any experience with that case or its airflow, but generally speaking you want a positive air pressure setup, which would mean more intake fans than exhaust.",so i would probably add 2 fans up front.,also your rear fan does not seem to be speed controlled - how is it connected?,"anyhow, thatâ€™s not actually going to address your issue.","either that cooler is simply not adequate, or you have a mounting / paste issue.","i would probably remount the cooler simply for diagnostic purposes, and make sure everything is tight.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"depending on timings it may actually last for 56 seconds, which is plenty of time for an overloaded cooler to overheat.",i daresay 15 seconds would probably be enough to reach throttle.,"and remember, if you didnâ€™t see the screenshot, it thermal throttled at just 135 watts power draw.","it didnâ€™t even get close to reaching 202 watts, not even for a second.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your cooler should be able to cool around 150w continuous with no problems.,if it canâ€™t you have a problem in cooler installation or fan settings.,"however, remember that 90c is normal.",itâ€™s only bad if it has to slow down due to heat.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i m not sure how to answer that , the case fan is connected to the mobo in the slot ""system fan"" or something like that.","as for the mounting i was a little confused , i had more than 10 years to build a pc , and in the beginning i got confused placing the cooler.","i put the plate below the mobo, i placed a thin layer of paste, and with a plastic card i spread the paste in the whole surface and screwed the cooler over the cpu.","i tried to find a video installing that cooler , but all of them were for amd which has different plate and different procedure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tau isnâ€™t the length of the boost so 56s tau doesnâ€™t mean 56 second boost.,itâ€™s confusing i know.,not reaching peak power due to thermal throttling makes no sense.,it would thermal throttle because it reached it.,if it only gets to 135w the cooler should be perfectly fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, from a little poking around it seems that cooler is designed for an â€œup toâ€ 150w tdp, which isnâ€™t quite what youâ€™re getting, but is also way below the 12900â€™s 200w pl2.",so iâ€™ll bet that it just canâ€™t handle that cpu.,"with that said, if you canâ€™t replace the cooler and remounting it doesnâ€™t improve things, technically thermal throttling wonâ€™t damage your system, it just means your performance will be lower.",you can also customize your pl1/pl2 values to simply limit the cpu to what your cooler can handle.,"for example, changing it from 65/202 to 125/125 may give you better performance than youâ€™re getting now, and lower temperatures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s really hard to say without seeing the system actually throttle.,"the screenshot of an r23 run showed stock pl values, 100 degree core temps, core thermal and power limit throttling, and a maximum of 135 watts package power.","voltage looked fine, 5.1ghz was hit, cooler fan also hit max rpm.",idle temps were warm but did cool down from the run.,mostly likely bad mounting or woefully inadequate cooler?,did recommend a remount.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ok

i ll try to remount the cooler to check.",i ll also buy a couple of fans for the front case.,after all this can you suggest a cooler (not very expensive !),that can do the job ?,thanks a lot for the effort and advice.,can i dm you when i have news?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if the chip is at stock settings it should have tau of 28 seconds and pl1 of 65w.,"with boost to 135w and assuming starting from around 20w idle that should produce a boost of around 20s, after which the chip would obviously get power limited.",the 65w pl1 doesnâ€™t really allow very long boosts for that power hungry chip.,but if the cooler is correctly installed there should not be thermal throttling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, no problem to dm.","iâ€™m afraid i donâ€™t have any specific cooler recommendations, but you want something thatâ€™s generally considered a cheaper noctua d15 alternate.",whatâ€™s your budget?,"you could consider a 280/360 aio, but again, it would have to be a decent one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"12900 says up to 202w pl2, and while i know it doesnâ€™t have to reach that, 135w seems low for an r23 run that will typically trigger 210-225w on a stock 12900k.","regardless, itâ€™s throttling, so a cooler problem needs to be addressed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks a lot for your help.until now i haven't  given any thought on tdp, i wasnt even aware of it.i had a i7 2600k with stock cooler which also went to terrible temps but i wasnt even aware that this throttles the cpu (yes i was under a rock !)",".looking around on the net i found 2 options considered good:

it's the amount of cpu pcie 5.0 lanes available.,"raptor lake and alder lake both support pcie 5.0 nvme drives, and plenty of motherboards also support this via bifurcation.","it will require next gen gpus running at 5.0 spec, will drop to 8x gpu (16x 4.0 equivalent bandwidth) and then you have 8x lanes free for 5.0 nvmes.","my hero board can drop to 8x gpu, and then has a slotted card that can support 2x 5.0 nvme drives.",my asrock board has 5.0 nvme slot on the board directly.,"same situation is that it drops 16x gpu slot to 8x 5.0, again not an issue since this is same bandwidth as 16x 4.0 which is nowhere near getting saturated anytime soon.","by the time this is a limit, you'll be getting a new board with pcie 6.0

ahh thanks!,i had not really looked that deep into it since there aren't any 5.0 drives available yet.,"i honestly don't think i'll even bother with a 5.0 drive tbh, 4.0, hell even 3.0 is enough for any gamer.",maybe that will change going forward but for now there difference ain't worth the price of admission.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, that's because only 8x8x config is supported for bifurcation, its same on z790.","so when you add a m2 drive like that through an aic, you essentially lose 4 lanes.",asus hyper relies on mother bifurcation to function.,it doesnt do any pcie signaling on the card itself.,"to make use of all 8 lanes for ssd, you would need a 8x raid card that i don't think it even exists for gen5 right now and if there was one it would cost more than the motherboard...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what happened to the 6ghz claims?,they can't possibly be getting 600mhz more out of the 13900ks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
best or fastest?,"""fastest"" is likely to be the 13900k or the 7950x (there was a leaked benchmark showing them pretty much neck and neck a little while back), but the _best_ one is probably the 13600k on the grounds that the vast majority of titles won't really benefit much from the extra two p cores and slight clock speed gain.","then if amd launches a v-cache version of the zen 4 cpu in the spring it might take the crown, but cache increases do eventually run into diminishing returns, so we'll have to wait and see.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably the 13600k.,"the 700 and 900 will of course be better, but the 600 is almost certainly going to be all you'll ever need for just gaming, and it'll probably be a very good processor for productivity too.",i expect it'll destroy my 3900x at just about everything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's on purpose lol.,although i do think raptor will do quite well against zen 4 as the initial offering is extremely underwhelming.,the only chip worth it is the 7950x.,the 7900x/7700x/7600x are overpriced.,"but it's not even the overpriced that is the issue, its the ""x3d"" looming in the shadows.",why would you buy a $399 7700x when the 7800x3d at $449-499 is releasing at ces 2023 in a few months and will destroy even the 7900x in most things,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the situations aren't entirely the same.,"usually in intel land, as long as you provide a decent cooler, it'll hit the advertised limits.","(my 12900k at stock hits 5.2, it doesn't when temp limited to 80c though)  'upto' really means 'as long as you can cool it'

"you could go for a 13500, the leaked specs show that it has 6p8e cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"""investing"" in an amd platform because you plan on upgrading later is not very smart because it might take a very long time (more than 1.5 years) for amd/their partners to push bios updates for new cpu support for their first gen motherboards just like what happened for ab350 am4 and the 5000 series.",or it might just never happen if you picked the wrong board or if amd decides they don't need to do it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intel themselves state that the maximum resolution over hdmi is 4k @ 60hz.,dp is needed for higher.,"the fact that it works on linux is because the linux driver is using reduced chroma subsampling (4:2:0 instead of 4:4:4) to lower the required bandwidth, which the windows driver does not seem to support.","i donâ€™t know if it can be forced, but that can be what you look for next.","intelâ€™s hdmi implementation is only hdmi 2.0, not hdmi 2.1, meaning it supports a maximum of 18gbps bandwidth.","if we do the math:

3840x2160 @ 60hz 8-bit 4:4:4 = 17.82gbps
3840x2160 @ 120hz 8-bit 4:4:4 = 32.08gbps
3840x2160 @ 120hz 8-bit 4:2:0 = 17.82gbps

so without reduced chroma subsampling, 120hz is impossible.",one workaround if you really must have 120hz without buying a gpu is to buy a dp to hdmi 2.1 adapter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thanks for the thorough explanation.,i had forgotten to look into this.,"if windows does not support that particular reduced chroma sampling to support 120hz (stay within the 2

it's the display that needs to have hdmi 2.1 to work with g-sync.,"my tv supports that, and g-sync is enabled and working with my 2070.  the problem is that the 16/20 series nvidia gpus only had hdmi 2.0b, meaning i can't do 4k@120hz; i'm limited to 4k/60hz.","i could drop the resolution and get 120hz, but for 4k@120hz over hdmi i need a new gpu.","my gpu does have displayport 1.4, which has enough bandwidth to run 4k/120hz, but dp 1.4 to hdmi 2.1 converters don't work with vrr (based on what i've read).","so my choices with my current gpu are 4k/60hz with g-sync (via hdmi) or 4k/120hz without g-sync (via dp to hdmi converter), unless i want to drop the resolution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

simple answer.,no.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i paired my 11900k with a thermalright peerless assassin se.,i spent $220 on the cpu and $35 on the cooler.,with a .75mv undervolt max temps are 72c.,prior to the undervolt it ran at 80c.,this is with a 205w heat load and no overclock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

so it is the asus prime z590-p. is that a decent board?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is just a bad take.,11900k was not great on release due to price point and low upside vs previous gen. if you can get it for a good price itâ€™s still an i9.,"that said, op there are potentially some other options out there depending on sales especially around 13th gen/7000 series launch which should drop previous gen prices and cyber monday etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

here is how i make my purchase decision.,"1. features
2. performance 
3. costs

you may adjust these, maybe

1. costs
2. performance
3. features

usually for a z board the cost is high and features/performance scale with the costs.",performance maybe less.,"https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2021-intel-core-i9-12900k-i5-12600k-review?page=4

that said for 350 and excellent cpu performance on the 11900k is a clear winner.",z590 boards have more features to play with but will mean nothing if you don't use them.,a 12600k with cheaper motherboard maybe better performing but you lose on a white motherboard with quality parts and bios functions.,it's honestly entirely upto you.,but the asus prime boards look nice and come with some really excellent features.,such as overclocking and ai self learning overclocking.,it maybe a bit of a gimmick but it's a fun feature to mess with nonetheless.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well it depends on what you call â€œmaximumâ€ all core boost.,if my processor can stay below 68c it will maintain thermal velocity boost peaking the cores at 4.8ghz resulting in a cinebench r23 score of 15200. i typically see 4.7 all core boost with an r23 score 14860.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so you are saying it is not that good?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so i decided to go for an i9-11900k with an asus z590-e. after rebate it will be about $360 and comes with a few games.,any advice on a cooler?,"on my current i5-6600k, i'm using a cryorig h7, but i think it is not.",the [noctua nh-u12s redux](https://www.amazon.com/noctua-nh-u12s-performance-cooler-redux-1700/dp/b08wpdd6gd/ref=sr_1_3) is $46 on amazon.,"i think the more popular one is noctua nh-d15, but it cost like twice as much.","also, for memory can i re-use my ddr4 2x 8gb (g-skill f4-3000c15-8gvgb used with my i5-6600k) while i wait for a good deal on a 32-64gb?","not too worried about any performance hit, as it can't be worse than my i5-6600k anyhow.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't know if i have a golden sample or something but my 11700k does better than that at similar temperatures.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
quite good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would just grab the arctic liquid freezer ii 240mm aio and bite the bullet.,see if it can fit inside your chosen case.,the 240mm rad is for 120mm fans and is a bit thicker than a normal 240mm radiator.,normal ones are maybe 1 inch thick.,this one is 1.5 inch thick.,so the 240mm radiator has the same volume of liquid as a normal corsair or another 360mm aio.,arctic liquid just has thicker radiators.,which mean better performing.,it is about 98 dollars on amazon for nonrgb.,i have that exact cooler.,your system will be absolutely silent and cool with that.,it is worth every penny.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the z590-e is a great motherboard.,it is mid to high end so will have almost every feature you could ask for.,the next step up is crazy vrm water cooling armour or extreme vrms for insane power delivery.,which is completely overkill for regular old gaming.,but that is the oc market.,i like the z590-e it has a lot to offer and you can learn a lot from asus's ai overclocking.,just copy what it does until you get a good grasp of oc.,then do on your own!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is that an overclock though?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> noctua u12s

is there a cheaper air cooler you would recommend?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
should i go with the arctic liquid freezer ii 240 or 280?,"i'm thinking anything larger is unlikely to fit inside my case, which is [this one](https://www.newegg.com/p/n82e16811315004?item=n82e16811315004).","also, do you know if [this ram](https://www.gskill.com/product/165/184/1536045781/f4-3000c15d-8gvr-eol) would work with the i9-11900k and z590-e?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i've messed with nothing, except use an aio.",run it with out of the box settings on an msi z590 board using hynix d-die ddr4 at 4533 mhz gear 2. it runs all core workloads at 4.9 ghz for six cores and 5 ghz for two cores.,i'm yet to check what happens in light low core workloads.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cooler master 212 hyper,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that case looks really well built.,it can even accept 360mm radiators.,the 280mm will be wide and require 140mm fans that the 280 come with.,the 240mm can attach to the 3 120mm fans that the case comes with.,and the 240mm aio includes 2 120mm fans.,so you would have 4 fans attached to your 240mm alfii 240mm aio.,you can chose the 240mm or the 280mm.,i have the 240mm aio and i never hear the 120mm fans.,the 280mm would be even more quiet because they have 140mm fans.,generally larger fans = more quiet.,the 240mm matches or exceeds corsair/coolermaster/nzxt and other 360mm radiators.,this is because the 360mm rads are 1 inch thick.,"but arctic liquid 240mm, 280mm, and 360mm rads are 1.5 inches thick.",so 240mm already exceeds most 360mm rads.,having the 280mm just means more cooling.,but it is larger and requires 140mm fans.,your seasonic case includes 120mm fans.,you have to buy 140mm fans optionally.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes that ram will work.,as long as it is ddr4 it will work.,are those your existing ram sticks already?,"if it is, they will do just fine!","if you are buying new, the recommended ram is 3200mhz minimum.",but i believe 3600mhz ram pair better with the 11900k for overclocking.,"if budget is tight, ram can always be upgraded later down the road when ddr4 becomes wayyyyy cheaper due to ddr5 adoption.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"no, definitely no.",deepcool as500/ak620 to tame this beast.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"after looking at it, i think you are right as the 360 makes more sense.","it uses the standard 120mm fans that is already available in the case, if i ever need to replace them.","it also has larger capacity, and i doubt the noise difference is significant considering it is also bigger volume, and more fans to cool.",it's probably overkill if anything.,i guess this is a one time purchase in hopes that it will last me until the next upgrade and i can reuse the aio in 5-8 years on whatever is out then.,"that is, unless we moved pc to arm sooner.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> are those your existing ram sticks already?,"if it is, they will do just fine!","yeah, they are existing sticks in use.","i figured i can save some money for now, and upgrade the ram later as they are still a little pricey.","after all this, waiting on a great deal on a gpu.","for that, i might have to wait a lot longer though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would pickup the 240mm as it is easier to install and more versatile.,the 360mm is large !,even the 280mm is good.,just you would need 140mm fans if you wanted 4 fans attached to you radiator.,but its a lot of fans!,maybe 360 or 240 is the sweet spot.,i picked the 240mm for easy install in a cramped case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

all of the bigger ones usually have the first shipment before the official launch date.,how many will be available is another question which nobody can answer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in essence yes at the cost of cutting your gpu x16 bandwidth to x8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
simple answer: no.,not any more than 12th gen did.,"there is no change to pcie 5.0 capabilities between 12th and 13th gen. old information fully expected an increase in pcie 5.0 lanes on 13th gen, but this did not occur.","long answer: yes, but only in very specific circumstances, which are identical to the requirements for 12th gen motherboards.",situation 1: dual pcie 5.0 slots.,"this will show up as your normal x16 slot, plus a second x8 slot that, when in use, drops the first slot to x8 mode.","this involves the use of an expensive pcie 5.0 switch and, as such, only shows up in higher end boards, such as the asus z690 hero.",situation 2: an onboard pcie 5.0 m.2 slot.,"this is technically the same workaround as situation 1, but instead of letting you plug a full x8 card in if you wanted, forces you to go with an x4 m.2 drive.",i assume this only requires an x4 switch instead of an x8 switch?,not sure how the switches are designed.,"anyhow, there are a few boards with this option, such as the asus rog strix z690-e.

in either situation, 12th and 13th gen cpus can only natively support one x4 pcie 5.0 ssd via these methods, as the cpu only supports bifurcating (splitting) the pcie 5.0 lanes into x8/x8, and not x8/x4/x4.","so if a pcie 5.0 ssd is used on 12th or 13th generation boards, technically x4 lanes will go wasted.","perhaps someone will come out with an x8 add-in card that will allow dual ssds, but it wonâ€™t be native.","and yes: the asus hyper card that ships with some boards supports dual 4.0 ssds when installed in the proper x4/x4 slot, but only one 5.0 ssd when installed in the 5.0 slot.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they have to borrow lanes from the 16 for gpu.,there is no other way.,its possible to implement on the more expensive boards.,you can have 8x gpu and a single nvme drive.,2 4x are not supported at least not officially.,this was possible on z690 too.,yo can use a gen5 nvme on a board like carbon by putting it into 2nd x16 slot.,i think intel showed a video doing just that.,you can get a gen5 u2 ssd and use a carrier to use it with z690 right now but it cost shit load of money.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16. on gen5 no.,8x gen5 with geforce 4000 series should be fine but with a 3090 that is a gen4 card you lose a little bit of performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4090 is also a gen4 part.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you were probably looking at vid not vcore.,there is no way your cpu was running a load at 1.7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it was... 1.68v and idle temp was 60c in bios... i was like why the hell i have so high idle temp ive thought i didnt mount aio right then i saw 1.68v on auto and ive changed to 1.37...  


ps:  i didnt try load anything with 1.7v, ive saw high idle temps and i knew it something isnt right... i cant imagine if i would load something like cinebench my cpu will be potato",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well if it didn't have a load on it then it didn't matter that much because there would have been minimal current being pulled.,my 11700k spikes to like 1.55v sometimes when hit with a super bursty light load but it's actual full load voltage with my oc is like 1.37v.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"look, iâ€™m not saying i 100% doubt 13th gen will have at least an ok uplift, but what iâ€™m saying is that iâ€™ll believe it when i see it when it comes to these insane claims from intel leaks (and amd as well)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and, two days ago, the 13700 full power chip showed up on passmark doing no better than a 12700k.","these random, unverifiable and typically contradictory benchmark â€œleaksâ€ are about as useful as a lifetime supply of 10base2 cables.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the headline makes it sound like intel is beating amd and incredibly efficient in only 35w.,"for context, the i7 13700t ""35w"" turbos up to 100w.","when your max turbo is 3x the tdp, it can be a bit misleading to say the least.",to give you an idea of what you might get in a sustained workload once the 35w power limits kick in... the 12700t p-core base clocks were only 1.4ghz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'll believe it when i see it fully.,"the jump from 11th to 12th gen had leaks crowing about huge improvements to performance, but it was believable because of the major architecture difference.",getting e cores would obviously improve performance over a standard 10 core (or 8 core in the case of 11th) cpu.,"but this generation seems to be an increase in e core count, which will help but won't be the same kind of lift we saw going from 11th to 12th gen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i call bs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12700k is also faster than the 5800x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"rl will be faster then zen4 in most multicore benchmarks, as they simply have more cores.","even if the performance cores can't go full speed, because of power and heat, the simple fact that they have more cores gives them the advantage.",we saw this a lot since amd upped the core counts.,"no matter how fast your 8 core is, if you need to fight against 8p+8e cores you are bound to lose.",personally i will be more interested in single core performance and efficiency.,"if the cpu needs 350w to be 3% faster, than the competition with 150w ... well...

aside from the additional cost it's also about the additional heat.",and the taxing the power supply even more.,"biggest power usage still comes from the gpu, but a cpu with 250-350w usage is not funny anymore.","(more or less random numbers, this was an example without intel or amd in mind)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
geekbench is an extremely bursty workload where pl2 is in effect more than pl1.,the 35w figure is meaningless in this context.,"iirc igor's lab posted about what the pl2s for raptor lake-t series were a while back, but i can't remember the exact numbers.",those are the relevant figures for these comparisons.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"while it is a common talking point to claim that windows 10 21h2 fully updates its thread director to be just like windows 11's with full hybrid cpu awareness, i would like someone who claims this to **please provide a link to a single reputable tech site that verifies this claim.",** because i have seen no such report myself.,"here are the facts as i have read them:

1. windows 10 works fine with alder lake.","it is ""supported"" in that it works and isn't going to crash or something, and performance is good.","2. windows 11 works ""better"" with alder lake, in that its thread director has smarter control over where processes are assigned (ie.","fewer poorly optimized processes - remember, it's not like an e-core operates at 1/100th the speed or something, so you may not always notice or care when something is assigned to the less ideal core).","it's typically described as ""smoother"".",3. some people don't report experiencing any issues on windows 10.,"4. some people do report issues on windows 10. i'm going to put that down to differing workloads and differing sensitivities to what an ""issue"" actually is.",5. the problem with many drm games not working right with e-cores was not fixed by simply giving windows 10 windows 11's thread director.,"both platforms needed fixing, and typically it was the game/protection that needed the fix, not the os.","plus, most motherboards let you easily disable e-cores on the fly if you still have any issues.","6. all of this only affects hybrid alder lake models, ie.","the 12600k and above, where processes that should be going to a p-core might end up on an e-core (and be slower), or vice versa (when that p-core is actually needed for something else, or when power efficiency is desired).","if you have the 12600 or below, you do not have a hybrid cpu and there will be no possibility of hybrid-related issues, regardless of operating system.","7. windows 10 21h2 was released on november 16, 2021, shortly after alder lake came out.",however its preview releases started many months earlier.,"if it were to include a brand new thread director, i'm sure it would have been reported by somebody.","i'm sure intel would know about it, too.","but instead they have this article:

updated march 9, 2022, which is nearly 4 months after 21h2 was released.","indeed, the wayback machine doesn't have any record of that page until march 2022.

anyhow, would love to see some updated info on this if it exists!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
last major update for windows 10 was back in early 2020 with the release of version 2004 (build 19041).,"all subsequent updates (20h2, 21h1, 21h2 and now 22h2) were minor, with just a thing or two backported from windows 11 and a minor enablement update that bumps the build number by 1 to distinguish them (even the cumulative update cab is shared between those versions).","while it's possible that microsoft backported the new scheduler from windows 11 to windows 10, i don't think they did since i haven't seen any official announcement.","so, although 12th gen works with windows 10, you might be leaving a bit of performance on table...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12th gen will work on w10 but it wont work properly.,everyone i heard who owns alder lake cpus says they work better on w11 because of the scheduler where it allows e-cores to be properly be utilized.,did something change recently in w10 that now allows proper utilization of the e-cores?if not then w11 is still the better choice when e-cores are involved.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i mean, please provide a single reputable tech site that has evaluated thread director and demonstrated its impact.",(in all seriousness if you did iâ€™d be impressed because i canâ€™t find any myself).,most just minimized apps - thatâ€™s not thread director as thatâ€™s an os feature and clearly already in windows 10. some pointed out bugs/issues with thread priority - again not thread director as priority is an os construct.,seriously no site has properly evaluated this thing but keeps talking about it like its a big deal.,"you need complex workloads with threads simultaneously exercising a mixed instruction set using some heavy avx, and some mainstream typical code, and it has to be parallel enough to need more than 8 p cores.",intel in their own hotchips talk basically said it wonâ€™t impact mainstream applications as those are all the same classification (ie equal) to thread director.,"itâ€™s about differentiating avx heavy workloads from the mainstream apps, and prioritizing the avx on p cores.",thatâ€™s it.,windows 10 doesnâ€™t have thread director because it honestly doesnâ€™t matter.,itâ€™s intel marketing hype.,and you know how we know this for certain?,"if it was so incredible, intel would have an on/off switch to let reviewers test just the impact of thread director.",wouldnâ€™t they want to celebrate their impressive hardware feature?,what is happening as you have mentioned is that games and applications were updated which have nothing to do with the os.,did microsoft patch other scheduler improvements for hybrid chips that isnâ€™t thread director?,they publicly mentioned that windows 11 had generic improvements for arm big little scheduling as well.,they might have just brought those to windows 10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
w10 had the scheduler updated when 12th gen released.,you guys keep parroting the same bunk point.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 12400f is not a hybrid cpu, so it would not experience any issues with p-core/e-core process assignment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fair enough.,"somebody needs to devise a test that throws a wide variety of high-impact workloads at the system at the same time to see if there even is any measurable impact - never mind its actual usefulness, just whether it does anything different at all.",benchmarks that load up all cores uniformly or just measure mid-level loads like gaming donâ€™t seem to have statistically significant differences.,maybe this will become more of an issue as e-cores increase?,"like the 13900k with 16 e-cores and 8 p-cores, the odds of getting it â€œwrongâ€ in a meaningful way increase.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"toms hardware saw some serious performance issues relating to win10 and alder lake:

https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/intel-core-i9-12900k-and-core-i5-12600k-review-retaking-the-gaming-crown/7

that may be fixed now, but in earlier reviews there were definite issues with win10 correctly prioritizing faster cores over slower ones.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thatâ€™s what i thought, iâ€™ve never heard any youtuber or read a tech article that mention an update for the scheduler.",i found out from a random youtube comment saying there was an update for w10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i swear i saw a couple of threads about people complaining about how their alder lake cpu isn't using the e-cores properly on w10 and every time people suggest to upgrade to w11.,if there was an update to address that issue it must have been really recent.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ok, but op never mentioned specifically which cpu he wants.",all he said was 12th gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
agreed with what you said.,"sadly if itâ€™s so hard for reviewers that they have to go out of their way to devise new workloads, then i honestly donâ€™t think they are going to put in the effort.",the audience wants flashy youtube videos and lots of graphs so techtubers rush out benchmark quantity to fill the time rather than actual in-depth understanding and explanation.,"thread directors impact, at least in theory, would not increase when you have more e cores but rather its impact will increase more when you have fewer p cores.",itâ€™s value in theory comes into play when your workload has too many threads and not enough p cores and is forced to spill over to e cores.,the truth is that the 8 p cores is enough for so many client workloads that things arenâ€™t typically spilling over.,iâ€™d venture a guess that it matters more on say a 15w chip that only has 2 p cores.,but those chips are the ones that make the least sense for running some avx heavy workload.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
windows 10 build 21h2 fully supports alderlake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"true, true.","however the op's question about 21h2 supporting alder lake would be based on information related specifically to hybrid architecture and e-cores, even if the op is unaware of that.",guess it would help to know which cpu he's concerned with.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you're right, i forgot not all 12th gen's have p and e cores, only from i7 12700 and up.",will update post.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it should be obvious to anyone familiar with the topic which cpus you meant.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15% is very good gains.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15% over gc will be a huge step.,i just hope the 13600k remains under 350.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you amd for giving intel a kick in the ass.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
raptor lake with sk hynix a dies hitting 7600-8000mts is going to be a ripper gaming rig.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15% sounds like a lot for relatively minor update.,that's ~7% from clocks and the rest from cache improvements?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seems like this will just destroy zen 4 across the board.,amd had better cut prices.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rip amd for gaming / prices.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at the same power?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
raptor lake with hynix a die kits should be very fast in some games like total war.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if they only hike pricing by 10% zen 4 will be a major flop,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
now lets hope this is enough of a kick to get amd back into competitive mode rather than ripoff mode.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
multi thread not as important as single thread speeds for gaming,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that sounds about right for specint.,"(generally â€” integer likes cache and clocks,   while floating point likes bandwidth and clocks)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if we assume both amd and intel are giving us accurate numbers, ~29% st / 45% mt for amd and ~15% st / 41% mt (but based on specint2017, let's assume it's within +-5-10% of that on average), then this generation will likely be actually pretty close.","i think raptor lake will destroy zen 4 in mt for lower price segments by having more cores, but for gaming that 29% uplift will likely shrink the gap a lot.","as for mt in the high end i think it will vary a lot for the workload's scaling and who has to thermal throttle first, 16e cores seems like it'll be amazing if the use case scales that well but if it doesn't i have a hard time seeing it beating those high clocked zen 4 cores.","the real unknown is how the v-cache line will stack up, but that's not going to happen until next year.","hopefully this close-in-gaming and bloodbath outside the high end will cause some price wars between amd and intel, i'm happy that we're not at the point where either company is unquestionably universally ahead.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if intel gave 16 big cores yesâ€¦but they donâ€™t.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no but donâ€™t you seeeeeee???,"amd is good and intel is bad, who cares about price?",.,.,/s,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel (like all it's competitors) will advertise performance numbers based on in-spec settings.,"adl pl2 value is 241w, and rpl is 253w, so those are almost guarantied to be the power limits in place for this test, so very similar power.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
somebody didn't like you pointing that out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"unsure of power, but i would hope these figures are based from the same locked freq.",if they aren't... this may be in trouble when compared to amd's.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"now that i looked at it a bit, if the rumors about the new stock boost frequencies are true it might be 10% from clocks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
who cares?,"for the record, iâ€™m anticipating the 13900k vs 7950x matchup to be a draw overall, and i think both of them will be completely impractical anyway thanks to being impossible to cool.","the 13400, 13600k and 13700k, look like theyâ€™re just going to destroy the 7600x, 7700x and 7900x respectively in multicore/$ though, and will at least get within a few percentage points in single-threading.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
here's some insight in to intels thinking before amd was a competitor: [https://www.pcworld.com/article/419533/future-intel-chip-tech-will-sacrifice-speed-gains-for-power-efficiency.html](https://www.pcworld.com/article/419533/future-intel-chip-tech-will-sacrifice-speed-gains-for-power-efficiency.html),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel already said there isn't any other behind the scenes improvements.,it's all node improvements for clocks and cache helping ipc.,raptor lake only exists due to meteor lake being very late.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
those of us with multi threaded workflows that depend on the performance of the underlying cores for synchronization reasons.,the nature of my workloads mean that instead of 8+16 i am really getting 0+24 which has performance similar to cpus from several generations ago.,"iâ€™m hoping the xeon mainstream workstation chips will be competitive with amd, but in the mean time, iâ€™m going with a 7950x.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"you can buy a graphics card and use that, yes.","the uhd 730 is literally built into your cpu, so it will still exist in the computer after you install your new graphics card, but it will be disabled.",obviously make sure you plug your monitor hdmi cable into the graphics card instead of the motherboard's hdmi port afterwards (sometimes people forget to do that).,"before you rush out and buy one, just make sure your power supply can handle it, both in terms of wattage and in pci-e cables you may need to plug into it.","some cards don't use much power, others use a lot.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

pcie will always run at the highest common link speed.,so for example a device that supports gen 3 will also support al the lower generations.,"in your case you plugged a gen 3 device into a gen 5 system, in which case the highest generation that both devices support is gen 3. 
so the link will be at gen 3 speed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's correct.,you can also use gpu-z to check.,i'm wondering if the motherboard has renesas rc26008 external clock generator.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

can you please elaborate?,do you mean it depends on the gpu gen?,what is renesas rc26008 external clock generator?,my question is should it say 4.0 because it supports 4.0 or whatever is the generation of the gpu it shows?,"just want to be sure because i want to use the full advantage of gen 4 when i upgrade my gpu, and there are no issues with the motherboard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mostly use reddit on phone.,so clicking a photo and posting is easier for me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it can only run at the speed of the lowest generation device.,in your case gpu at 3.0 < mobo/cpu at 4.0 so it will run at 3.0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

itâ€™s fine for basic tasks.,"email, web browsing, youtubeâ€¦etc.",better than low end laptops using celeron n4020 or similar that you can find being sold new still.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3mbs of l3 cache.,yikes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's crap.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why bother asking us?,you have already bought the laptop.,you know better than any of us whether it meets your needs.,lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its meh.,sup with the clock speed?,u got the buttery saver runnin munnin?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"my laptop has a two generations older cpu and it served me fine through college, just don't expect any heavy workloads to work out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this would be ok but for using browser or office - if u plan to use this for anything else - better kick it out of the window,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's a cpu generation from 2013 and one of the less expensive models.,"it's not ""good"" but it should work.","at least this laptop seems to run on a ssd, that's the most important property for your use case.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how much did u get it for ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hate to break it to you butâ€¦

well itâ€™s fine for like web browsing and watching videos (not like 1440p but itâ€™s fine)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it works for youtube office browsing and social.,gaming old games 2007 and earlier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
office work and browsing.,small gaming like megaman x4 etc (the retro games) twisted metal 2 and 1 etc..should be perfect,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its an okay cpu.,"if your using it for work and browsing, it get the job done.",not the best for gaming however.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
honestly id say its good because it gets the job done.,"i have an i5 4200u and it does everything i need it to, light gaming included.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
usable for web browsing i guess.,"thats a haswell 4th gen, mobile core i3.",expect lag and i mean a lot of lag if you try to even run youtube at 1440p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the cpu should be good enough to browse youtube and such but don't expect to have many tabs open before it chokes a bit.,"at least you have an ssd, that'll help.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my laptop (i5 3230m) is still good for office or search wed :d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very slow and old processor so i'd say no its not anygood especially in the day and age.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no but it's still fine for all of the typical use cases like light web browsing and microsoft office.,you'll see it struggle in multitasking though and it won't be as efficient as other newer chips.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that computer is only good for school work or a backup laptop,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you should ask this before, not after, purchasing it.","ðÿ˜…

anyways, this good is a good example... when someone reuses something instead of it going to the trash.","like everyone else said, it depends on your needs... but for the basics, like web browsing, it's plenty enough.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe browsing will work but 2 cores don't really cut it anymore with win10 and later.,i had an athlon 3020e  (first generation or maybe zen+ based chip i think) and it was simply dreadful.,it worked sometimes  but the overall experience was  extremely slow and  laggy  (even opening the calendar and notification center took tens of seconds  time  to  time) and browsing  wasn't  good  either.,"i guess this i3 may  at least have hyper threading but otherwise i wouldn't really recommend 2c/2t cpus nowadays, on windows at least.",ubuntu ran just fine on that athlon for example.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the answer is simple.,no!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no xeon e5 2699v3 the best 27$ 
xeon e5 2699v3> i5 10400f",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a used laptop with an i7-4710hq in it that is considered worthless by windows even though it does everything i would need and more.,"if browsing and office work is all you do, youâ€™re good.","if windows cuts you off eventually, linux will run magnificently on it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
decent grab depending price.,it's an m-series i3 that is a pga chip aka replaceable.,if this is a latitude e6x40 it's easy to swap in an i5 or i7.,just pay attention to socket size because i think the mq chips use a larger socket.,these things are good little daily drivers with an ssd and 8gb-16gb.,if it's a dell like i think then it's among the last latitude series with user-serviceable batteries.,"throw an ac wifi chip in there too, it's a cheap/small upgrade that goes a good way in older laptops.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"man i have a i7 4600u works superb for all my normal tasks not gaming, can do some light photoediting and gta v on med",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

try cpuz!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
should be fine for basic things.,iâ€™d upgrade the ram to 16gb.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wonder how you made it for youtube 4k?,that cpu don't have vp9 hardware decoder for sure (also av1 too).,"then for the pure performance of this cpu, i don't think it can run 4k smoothly (my old i5 6200u took 50% cpu usage when playing youtube 4k25 vp9 videos).",can you take a screenshot of youtube stats for nerds and task manager when it play 4k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"definitely, you can make good use of it.",like others pointed out - good for basic stuff.,interested in running linux on it?,:),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
should have probably asked that question before you bought it.,"it'll be ""ok"" for basic web browsing, but in all honesty it's an ancient low end 2 core mobile cpu, with only 3mbs of cache which is pretty bad.",performance is probably similar to a desktop c2d.,an ssd can only improve a system so much.,it'll still struggle loading up heavier websites.,only 3mbs of cache is going to slow you down substantially.,"in my opinion i wouldn't have even bought it, especially since it for sure doesn't meet the requirements for windows 11. unless you plan on putting linux on it which is probably what is best, expect it to become obsolete in a few years when windows 10 support is dropped.","what i would do is install mint linux on it, or any other light weight distro, and it'll probably make it into a decent laptop.","windows 10 is too bloated for these old cpus, especially for ones that were never designed for windows 10.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s only saving grace is hyper threading giving it four concurrent threads.,"if it was just a dual core, i would of said donâ€™t bother buying it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if it works then it's as good as it ever was,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is it decent efficient whilst doing that or will it be like a pentium 4?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"its just basic webbrowsing and stuff, for everything demanding i have my ryzen 5 5 5600h",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

its a fairly high end ssd too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
about 70â‚¬,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it runns 4k yt just fine lmao,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it does yt in 4k lmao,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the post you replied to was silly.,out of curiosity i googled the performance compared to my laptop's i3-7020u and your 4th gen i3 is slightly quicker (i know it's not low voltage like mine).,my machine is just fine for the sort of tasks you're using yours for.,"you get to a point where something is good enough, and being faster than that isn't very noticeable.",i have a much more powerful desktop pc (10th gen i5) but my laptop is subjectively more or less as good for light tasks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good for what?,"if it meets your needs, then it is ""good.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no look at benchmark,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

relax,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it will increase speed instantly when required.,it can be made to run at higher clocks all the time but will give no benefit and will only increase heat and power consumption.,"modern gpus do the same, they run at very low core and memory clocks when in 2d mode.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it isnt much slower than my ryzen 5 5600 in single core actually,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is a very impressive cpu for its age actually,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"its the hd4600, (uses 2gb ram), it may be old, but still has plenty of power",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its not slow tho,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh no, it needs a bit more power than a i3 10th gen, and is only as fast as a u series i3 8th gen, you forget how inefficient intel chips still are nowdays",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my ryzen is pretty much as fast as a i5 11th gen whilst needing wayy less power,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i put a ssd in mine, and upgraded the ram from 4 to 8",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
after testing it i must say that it indeed is good these days,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"right, most mobile chips are made for efficiency, especially the lower end ones like the i3.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wait... are you using a 3rd gen cpu.. in your main laptop?,!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no it really can't lol.,"i can't find solid data because there's such a time gap between them, but the 5600h is about 3 times faster in single core.","and having 6 cores is a big deal, 2 cores is a major limitation these days that can't be made up for by single core performance no matter how good it is.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'm aware of how the governor works but i haven't seen intel cpus do this in stock behavior.,it isn't instantly (nanoseconds are not instantaneous) but i agree it's negligible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it has good video decoders(igpu)

i could run 8k yt with a 4790k igpu back in the day.","same arch, same decoders.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you have to remember you're comparing tdp though, under the same workload the newer chips won't need to use as much power as the 4th gen. i think it's great you're happy with the 4th gen chip and they're definitely still usable, but you can't gloss over the improvements in power and efficiency with the newer chips.","but yes, 10th gen isn't amazing with efficiency, the ryzen 5000 mobile chips run rings around them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the actual cpu itself is good too (for a 2c 4t),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wonder can it still play youtube 8k when youtube forced all of 8k resolution to av1 codec.,my i5 10500h almost gave up on this (igpu don't have hw decoder too).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"not really, my amd likes to just glitch out and stay at 0.4ghz, intel chips dont really do dis",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
people just underestimate old chips because their old systems probably ran slow (because hdd) and they blame the cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ouh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok thats good.,which one do you use now?,i use like 10th gen i7 g7 cpu (i dont remember the sku numerals),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 2nd number starts with 3, which usually indicates the generation, like in an intel core i9-12900k, 12 is the generation indicator, which means it's a 12th gen cpu and was released somewhere in 2021. now we're waiting for 13th gen raptor lake cpus which should release somewhere in a few weeks or a month, same with the amd 7000 series and the nvidia 4000 series",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"well, you already own the laptop.",why can't you see for yourself?,you can run benchmarks on it yourself or run the apps you use and see how it performs.,that will tell you exactly what to expect far better than any of us can.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

just to clarify when i mention tdp i'm more referring to power draw than cooling performance.,"for example, i've got a server with a celeron j4005 that's rated at 10w tdp.",the pentium silver n6005 is also rated at 10w tdp.,if we have the same workload on each of these chips (e.g.,"opening 10 browser tabs) i would bet the pentium will be drawing less overall power since it's a more capable chip on a newer node, therefore it doesn't need to work as hard as the j4005 to get the same result meaning less overall power draw.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intel has been losing money recently and it needs to refocus on its main line of product or more profitable markets.,"also, intel has been selling some divisions or shutting it down, so, i think that it is fair to think that there is a big chance for intel to cancel the project entirely or partially or at least changing its scope and objectives.","moreover, intel has been investing heavily upgrading it manufacturing sites (ohio, arizona, ireland and israel) and reopening some that were shut down in the past (like costa rica site, intel has been hiring people very aggressively and paying a lot of money to them); that is a very very big cash burning machine and of course it increases intel debt, so, that is another reason to decide to shut down non profitable projects and focus r&d money in the products that will give them the money back asap.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

actually real world economics is the perfect way.,every week the egg gets a shipment of these cards and they are sold out before the end of the week.,since mlid claims center around it supposedly being money loser for intel due to lack of target market interest and no sales is obvious bullshit.,the mods of this sub should give his posts the userbenchmark and wccftech treatment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

being correct about hardware specs isnt a 50/50 chance, because the specs themselves are a composite object of many many smaller probability entries.","being correct about the specs inherently requires you to be correct about the memory bus size (which has what like 4-5 different possible answers so you only have a 20% chance of being correct there), frequency (hundreds/thousands of possible variations, lets go conservative and say 1% chance), memory size (again theres what 4-5 different configurations used atm so 20-25% chance) etc etc

the chance of you getting every single last element of a specification correct with just those requirements is 0.2\*0.01\*0.25 so 0.05%

if you are looking at it as ""i bet you mlid is correct"" then yes, you ""technically"" have 50/50 odds because hes either correct or hes wrong, but the actual statistical chance of him being correct if his answer is completely randomised is closer to that 0.05% (much much lower in practice)

so getting anywhere close to 50% accuracy rate implies he has some sort of advantage weighting the odds in his favor very heavily since thats 3 orders of magnitude larger than the statistical average

edit: if you need a visual example of this in action.","consider firing a gun in an fps

you have two states, you either hit something or you didnt, so you could naively think that the average hit rate is 50%

the reality is that given a 1 pixel by 1 pixel hit scan weapon and a screen size of 1920/1080p your chance of hitting anything on the screen is actually size of the object youre trying to hit in 2073600

so trying to hit a 20 pixel target would be 0.00096450617% if you just fired randomly, to hit an accuracy anywhere close to 50% you have to be intentionally weighing the odds in your favor by aiming manually instead of firing randomly.",\#math,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i donâ€™t think hub is really taking into account how absurdly b-die scales (and furthermore dual rank b die on comet lake/zen 3 platforms).,sure the ddr5 may give you more bandwidth out of the box at xmp setting but for actual in game performance the average kit of b die can be tuned to match or slightly exceed tuned ddr5 in most games.,itâ€™s really hard to compete with stupidly mature ddr4 using newborn ddr5 dimms.,to be clear there is nothing wrong with purchasing ddr5 - and in fact at this point in time the price/performance is favorable especially if you donâ€™t want to tune timings since ddr5 doesnâ€™t scale nearly as well as ddr4.,i just wish they actually tried to tune both kits so you can see what both generations of memory are capable of.,using 3200 c14 b die dimms at xmp settings hurts my soul lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that was my take as well.,ddr5 prices have been viable for a while now but until very recently their advice was to stick to ddr4.,they have also been sandbagging the non 12900k alder lake parts with their 3200mhz ddr4 kits in their benchmarks even though we can now see from this test how much even the 12600k can benefit from a fast kit.,"but now that ryzen is getting mandatory ddr5 support, suddenly it's time to leave ddr4 and everything is unicorns and rainbows in ddr5 land.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

> i havenâ€™t heard any announcement from intel yet.,so what?!,is that any indication for intel not cancelling arc?,nope.,"since intel always claims the exact opposite shortly before, just to pull the plugs afterwards, right?","intel always played the long game when ultimately having to admit failure, to save them from any greater embarrassment and prolonged the respective announcements up until the last minute.",it would be their classical and well-developed salami tactics to save face firstly and save their stock from further plummeting secondly.,**history lesson:** take *optane* as an example.,"* remember when rumours came out (shortly after its introduction), that optane isn't selling any well to the supposed clientele in datacenter and to hyperscalers?","experts guessed, it was likely due to the excessive pricing, which made no sense (the pricing here).","*intel outright denied such claims as nonsense, claimed optane is selling in higher numbers than anticipated and that optane is a profitable product.","*

*opinion*: again, you didn't had to be an expert in anything, to conclude that intel was trying to convert their wholly unsold excess-inventory into cash and sell optane to consumers, to at least liquidate their stock on it, cancel the project as a whole afterwards and call it a day.","* remember when rumours got around, that optane isn't selling, like isn't selling at all to anyone?","expert guessed, that intel must selling it that aggressively into the consumer space, likely well below manufacturing costs, to get rid of the inventory for stopping the financial bleeding.","the cost-benefit-ratio itself is ultimately dooming the product to fail, given the traditionally razor-thin margins in the memory-business.","*intel denied such claims again, saying its selling and newer iterations are about to be released (due to its alleged success).","*

*opinion*: again, that expert thing.","it was obvious that no-one would buy it for the huge mark-up, when the product's price-tag is so absurd high, that its *cost-benefit-ratio* itself is dooming the product to fail.","* remember when rumours went around again, suggesting that intel's optane is a financial black hole and makes them massive losses?","industry-experts estimated that intel undoubtably must make a loss selling optane for such low price-tags, due to the estimated high manufacturing costs.",the *value for money* on optane just didn't exists.,*opinion*: the expert-thing once again.,"it was obvious by ball-parking pure manufacturing costs, that intel unavoidably must make huge losses when selling it to customers at such a low price-tag.","intel obviously tried to aggressively sell it well below manufacturing costs to ..

1. a) outdo competition of other memory-vendors by out-pricing them (which is highly questionable, legally), and ..

1. b) try to maintain their optane into life by selling it way below manufacturing costs (straight-out illegal; sherman act, predatory or below-costs pricing) in noble hope, that this move would enable them to increase the prices afterwards (which always was a incredibly idiotic thing; you almost never can establish higher product prices after its introduction (if none competitor left the market due to it), since no customer will accept that and will shy away from buying it).",* remember when micron and intel in 2018 announced that both are ending their development-collaboration on 3d-nand effective immediately?,"and shortly after, that they end even working on anything 3d-xpoint altogether?","industry-experts again figured, that this could mean *optane* really isn't selling in any greater numbers.","*intel immediately denied such claims immediately, said optane's development will further advance, no matter what*.",*opinion*: the expert again here.,it was obvious that optane isn't selling at all and that's why micron and intel ended their collaboration on 3d-xpoint altogether.,"they both wouldn't have departed from another, if optane was actually as promising as intel always claimed it to be.","* remember when micron and intel, just months after their initial announcement on the break-up of the collaboration on developing any further 3d-nand, suddenly announced that they even end any collaboration on their *phase-change memory* also, thus literally everything 3d-xpoint altogether after 2. gen optane?","industry-experts again interpreted this as a sure sign, that optane is sure not selling and may have no greater future.",*intel again denied anything and that intel will further develop optane on its own*.,*opinion*: the expert.,"as obvious as it gets, optane was dead-end technology if even micron, as the developing- and fabbing-partner behind it, wasn't interested in any further collaboration.",optane for sure wasn't selling at all.,"* remember when intel by the end of 2018 effectively pulled out of their joint-venture, the collaboration with micron ended in them splitting apart altogether and each of them doing any further development independent from one another and intel becoming a mere customer of micron over their own optane for only the next consecutive year?","experts asked themselves where optane (if intel wasn't knifing it already by then) was supposed to be coming from, when micron would end fabricating it after the year-long agreement.",*intel immediately backpedalled such rumours by saying it would further develop optane in their own fabs in new mexico*.,"*opinion*: it was plain to see, optane wouldn't have have any greater life-span from here on out, which further limited its adaptability and narrowing its unique selling-point even more, atop the disastrous non-saleability due to the already outrageous price-tag.",* remember when intel pulled out of optane as a whole in 2019 and sold its stake in the joint-venture with micron *im flash technology joint-venture (intel-micron flash technology) to micron?,"experts now asked again, where optane was suppsoed to be coming from when micron would definitely end fabricating it.","*intel again tried shutting down every doubts, claiming intel will itself fab it then.","*

*opinion*: it was obvious that intel won't say anything about its de-facto knifing, as long as intel tried to sell their inventory.","----
in the end, as many predicted since years, intel tried to silence every rumour which might interfere with their intention to sell excess inventory as long as possible, just to pull the plug as soon as no-one was found to buy anything of it and write it off officially as a loss and knife the division.","they tried selling it for years, problem was just, that **optain** in and of itself, was a dead-end product, since its market was so niche and mostly non-existent, that it **never should have left the drawing board**.","also, optain was never really possible to be **manufactured any economically viable**, since it had to be that excessively pricy to make a profit on it, even in the memory-business, where margins are razor-thin.","the market for it was so nichã© anyway, that the clientele would've only existed in theory.","eventually, that was proved in praxi.","**tldr:** throughout the years and the joint-venture, optaine never netted a single dime of profit for intel, while micron pulled the plug they knew it wasn't able to be manufactured with any profit anyway.",intel sold micron their stake (already attached with around $1b in losses to be paid by micron!),"for a reason, and micron packed it all in and sold the whole fab and everything in between, the moment they realised that intel likely sold micron their stake with well-cooked books and a fabricated balance-sheet to ditch a good chunk of losses to micron.","throughout the years, it's perfectly reasonable that micron also made billions of losses with optane.","----
same story goes for their lte-modems.","announced and later delayed a hundred times, canned before introduction while making intel billiosn of losses throughout the years.","their whole modem-division never made a single penny of profit, just to be sold for cents on a dollar the very moment the only lone customer jumped ship (apple).","yet, intel always was eager to keep up the picture that everything was fine, when it was everything else but fine.",,

you do know that you didn't need mlid to confirm this when most analyst says that axg is in trouble.,"while intel saved atleast $2b for axing some of its businesses (intel sports, drones, optane etc.)",intel spent $3.5b for axg and their ponte vecchio for aurora is yet to be deliver and the only product they release are a low end gpu and some weird mobile tablet gpu which samsung releases to korea only.,do you also know that optane demo its persistent memory for ddr5 only for pat to axe the entire optane business.,"regardless of what mlid said, it's not farfetch for intel to focus axg for their data center gpus rather than fighting a losing battle against amd and especially nvidia in the dgpu space.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

all i'm saying is mlid has no clue on what's happening at intel and acts like he knows more than what intel employees know.,from all his past *leaks* its very clear that he has no *insider* information at intel.,maybe he knows some marketing guys at intel or people in some of the online forums.,or maybe he knows some contractors or green badge guys at intel.,the kind of information that he talks about will be only available to the vps and its obvious that its out of the reach of tom @ mlid.,he should be truthful and tell the viewers that these are his assumptions/bets.,"there are reasons to assume those - the last quarter financials, the dgpu demand vs supply situation and so on are all against intel continuing with the product line.","but if you see the situation at intel, we see intel hiring more graphics engineers, gaming experts and resourcing axg for the upcoming projects.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the verifiable actions taken over the last 2 years is being accurate on his claims way more often than not.,"someone can say whatever they want whenever they want, but actions and results are what matters.",if those former actions and reliability issues continued then that would be a different story.,but that's not the case.,doesn't matter really.,you said it yourself that what i say isn't a compelling argument...so you'd have to continue watching his shit to see the change...also of which you won't do.,so...now what?,"guess we'll just move on because nothing i say will change your mind, and his recent (see 2ish years) results don't matter either since you don't pay attention to them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm drawing from my experience as a director of engineering.. but you're right that anything can be faked.,i still think mlid had some good contacts just like semiaccurate or semiwiki (daniel nenni) and you're welcome to downvote me for thinking differently than you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
different conversation - i was referring to he's had some people on his podcast that appear to be legit engineers.,that doesn't imply they're the same sources for the recent arc info.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>what people rarely understand is that informations related to product cancelations don't go out to even top level executives until the final announcement.,and it's simply impossible that mlid has any relationship what so ever with any intel top executive.,"after all, he's not even working with intel.",>finally coming to the question of whether arc is assessed to be discontinued.,to a question from intel employees in an open forum recently pat gelsinger said there is no question of canceling arc; not a least bit of chance in canceling arc.,because they're that committed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that doesnâ€™t really answer to what i said.,but have you looked at what is on that chip?,comparing raw die area isnâ€™t very interesting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol.,saying some weird tablet mobile gpu and giving credence to jon peddle tells me you know nothing.,not surprised you were manipulated by mlid.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

>intel's axg (aka accelerated computing systems and graphics) has an operating income of -$900 million year-to-date as of their q2 earnings call...that is brutal.,having to keep poring money into axg until celestial products are released (assuming they use alchemist and battlemage to fix all the hardware and software issues) is extremely hard for management to justify to the shareholders considering nothing has improved so far in q3.,"so...

>ponte vecchio not shipping in very high volume yet is probably responsible for non-trivial portion of that -$900 million

wait a minute... ponte vecchio too!?","bruh, that's the important part of intel's hpc ambitions!",>dcai group and sapphire rapids is also in a similar situation.,does that mean you kill dcai group and sapphire rapids?,and sapphire rapids too.,duh.,"so yeah, it would be stupid to cancel ponte vecchio and sapphire rapids as well as kicking out the dcai group.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
who cares about market price?,do you think tesla is more successful than toyota because of its stock price?,toyota is the number one automotive brand on the planet.,its ceo makes far less than say ford or gm ceos yet it beats them in every metric.,your original argument that western ceos somehow have some special recipe for success is completely untrue in the face of this kind of evidence.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i haven't down voted any of your comments.,we just have different opinions or/and perception of mlid.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my point is that this source would have to be much higher up the food chain - this isn't something that would be widely known.,his source would probably have to be a business head.,this isn't leaking how many cores are in something this is leaking insider trading information.,you'd see movements in stock price if it got out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"what is on the die is almost irrelevant, raw die size combined with yield dictate manufacturing cost.",if intel chips are vastly more expensive to produce for the same performance then they also have to sell for low or no profit to compete with much smaller chips that perform the same.,that's an unsustainable model.,raw die size is effectively all that matters.,the number of people who actually need or want av1 encoding is so insignificantly small as to be absolutely not anything intel can bank on to drive sales.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah media stuff doesn't take that much space so their architecture is behind nvidia and amd in architecture.,i guess their current graphics architecture is slightly ahead of vega graphics in ppa efficiency,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and not surprise your still on the notion that intel will keep chugging products like they were in early 2000s.,"just accept the possibility that intel will or might axe arc, regardless what mlid and analyst says because the facts are already there.",pat already said it recently,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yawn.,i'm not interested in exploring your attachment to your narrative and poor reading and comprehension any further.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i agree this would have to be a pretty high source though ""low level"" employees sometimes hear things from mentors or others higher up.","i honestly hope it's false and mlid got this wrong, don't get me wrong...

that said a lot of things (unfortunately) can be insider trading.",leaks of initial zen 1 performance for example would have drawn conclusions that amd was suddenly competitive ..   at a time where amd publicly appeared on a death spiral.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is yet another completely different question.,profit margins should be very good even with bigger dies.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m talking more about how much space goes goes to ai matrix acceleration stuff etc.,not all of the core does 3d rasterization.,these architectures are designed to do multiple different things and weight different workloads differently.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you're clueless about how essential gpus are to the future of computing, as are mlid and jon peddie.","there is no moving forward without gpus and if you can survive and be competitive in data center and hpc, you print extra money in consumer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
once those es go out the door it's pretty much public.,"in my experience when a business line gets blown up, the managers find out, lay off their employees and then get the axe when they are done.",sometimes it's just hr and they take out everyone at once.,it could have gotten out i just find it extremely unlikely it's this guy that got the info first.,"nevermind that the graphics division is behind the architecture on all the igpu going forward, and the data center and other applications which it's actually good at.",only gaming is bad and it's mostly drivers for old games.,it just doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's nto another different question, everything we're talking about comes down to die size.",profit margins are not going to be good when your 400mm^2 core is going to be have to sold at a price that the competitions ~200mm^2 cores are being sold at.,"intel is pricing their chips below the competitions far cheaper to make chips because their software is horrible, gaming performance is spotty and they aren't a trusted name for gaming.","if they can't maintain enough profit to pay off r&d and make the division profitable long term they'll close the division, it's that simple.",everything comes back to that.,there is absolutely no evidence and no reason to believe that profit margins will be very good when they are making crap cards and having to undersell the competition at a tier 1-2 below where the cards were aimed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
xmx must be taking quite a lot of space because they removed it from mtl tgpu.,even though it'd be more useful for mobile gpus.,maybe the trade off still wasn't worth the area spent on xmx.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you even read my comment?,"> just accept the possibility that intel will or might axe arc

what intel arc is?",it's intel consumer grade gpu for gaming.,do i think they'll axe the entire axg?,"nope, but there's a possibility the whole axg will focus on data center gpus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i agree itâ€™s basically ready for launch/at launch - and it seems a weird time to pull the plug.,"however, if it were cancelled for the long term for cash flow reasons, they might do what theyâ€™re doing.","sell the existing stock to recoup some costs, and work on the software until itâ€™s good enough to prevent lawsuits from customers.",atari actually did that with itâ€™s last product (of the 1990s) fwiw â€” they knew the atari jaguar was a fail by the end of 1994 or 1995 but they kept it on life support another 1-2 years just to get rid of inventory and get some cash back before finally officially announcing itâ€™s death.,i think intel is probably evaluating more hard decisions besides killing optane.,they had a really bad quarter and expect more up ahead.,"at least two of their biggest markets (us and eu) look to be slowing down for the next year or so â€” and china isnâ€™t looking so hot either, economically.",intel has committed to pouring a lot of cash into future nodes to keep a competitive edge on the cpu and foundry businesses.,"if the board / bean counters feel that they might not have enough cash flow for the worst case to keep foundry afloat, while itâ€™s known arc will take 3 generations / 4 years to be profitable - thenâ€¦

in any case i hope intel does well..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

and how much is with open side panel and what ambient temps you have?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
those temps are fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wouldnâ€™t be trying to overclock much with only a 240. i would just lower the overclock until you get to a temperature that youâ€™re comfortable with.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
temps seem fine to me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
check how your fans are mounted in the pc to make sure proper airflow is happening.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s just how it be with a 240mm aio.,"i had almost identical temps with my 11700k until i upgraded to a 360mm, and then my temps under hard load were around 87c",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

really ?,i mean i heard intel's 11th gen was hot af but not to this degree holly hell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's a b chipset, i ain't overclocking this bastard brother",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i see, i will keep a close eye tho cuz it took me a while to get my own build :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3 front intake fans, the aio is in a push configuration and mounted on top and one exhaust fan on the back",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so i should just buy a 360mm later down the line ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah that case is not likely to be helping, depending how it is set up.",where is the radiator?,is it drawing air from the top inward?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"75-80 isn't that hot, the limit is 100. if you can't improve your cooling then consider limiting the power slightly, that will help.",either in the bios or with intel xtu.,"it will slightly reduce your performance but you likely won't notice it, and in return you'll get lower temps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ohhhh sorry you added the flair of overclocking so i thought you had.,when did you build your system?,if itâ€™s like this out of the box are you sure everything is mounted correctly?,or were the temps ok and just recently shot up?,are you in a dusty environment?,could be your radiator is clogged.,did you use the pre applied thermal paste?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hey, it's great that you keep an eye on it.",things last a lot longer that way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
check your paste on your cpu.,also.,try making the rear fan an intake and only the top exhaust.,also.,wonder if your bios has something that is overdriving your cpu.,i had this happening on my amd chip.,once i fiddled with the bios my temps dropped dramatically.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how much power does you cpu draw?,intel overclocking utility and hwinfo64 show the numbers.,use fresh air intake and decent fans to create good airflow.,"and yes, these cpus run hot under load.","how much temp difference is there is easy to see from two experiments:

1. cool it down, apply full workload, such as prime95.",look at the *immediate* temperature jump.,it is not the cooler.,it's all the thermal resistance between the die and the top of the heat spreader.,2. use windows task manager or another program to assign the workload to one core only.,look at the temperature difference between different cores.,it is not the cooler.,it is how hard it is for the heat to propagate from the core to the adjacent regions.,"so, the top of that heating curve, the slow temp raise after the immediate jump is the warming up of the liquid and the air in the case (or the air cooler mass), and this is what you should be worrying about.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, its pushing air from the inside through the radiator",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks i will try that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh shit, i didn't see that, my bad dude.","&#x200b;

i built it like 3 days ago.","and yes all of my fans are mounted correctly, i had troubles getting the cooler's pump to work few days ago and took it back to the retailer where i bought it from, he said ""it's working"" after i heard him hitting it with something, my guess he did this so he won't refund me or replace it with a new one, imma talk to him once again tomorrow",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the thing is and what i'm seeing rn is my cpu swinging between 4800mhz and 4900 while idling at 48c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if u play at 1080p, 8700 is def gonna bottleneck your 3080",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12th gen is way better than all previous gens.,even upgrading from an i9 9900k to i7 12700k was a massive difference for me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i went from a 8700k to a 12700k and quite frankly it has been an underwhelming upgrade.,my min fps jumped quite a bit in certain games (forza horizon 5 being one example) but across the many games i've played the uplift has not been dramatic.,maybe i should have waited for 13th gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"itâ€™s probably bottlenecking a *little* bit, but if youâ€™re already hitting your refresh rate, who gives a fuck?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have another friend that has almost the same specs as yours.,he is using a 1440p monitor and is pretty smooth so i would suggest you upgrade a monitor if it fits ur budget and keep the processor since 8700k is still a great cpu but if you want to upgrade to a newer processor you can try wait for 13700k and either get that or a 12700k at a cheaper price and better deal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why did you get a 3080 if you don't plan to upgrade from 1080p in the near future?,even with next gens cpus you will have a cpu bottleneck with the exception of games with raytracing and if you enable it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the i7 8700 performs about the same as my overclocked 5820k (plz, i don't have time rn to prove this).",i'm using a 3070 ti and am cpu bottlenecked in 3440x1440 in a couple games.,"1080p, you'll definitely cpu bottleneck most games.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sometimes my i7 10700 doing bottleneck for 12 gb rtx 3060.,"(example marvel spider-man) 

btw, this is a rare case and you can make the best decision based on your target fps and resolution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not really.,you have a slight bottleneck.,not worth spending money on new cpu and mobo.,you might find a second hand 9900k if its cheap to get you more frames.,as long as you are 5.1 ghz all core or higher you should be fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a 3080 at 1080p will do 144hz all day or even 240-360hz for lighter stuff.,it's really best for 4k 75-90 hz or 1440p 144hz imo.,"i know you said you aren't upgrading your panel, but i can promise you won't regret it if you get a really good quality one.",i think you'd benefit from an upgrade to say a 12700k if you also compile code and edit 4k video.,maybe wait for the 13700k and pick up a ddr4 motherboard to go with it if you really want something that will last you 3-5 years no problem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
even 12400 bests 8700k.,yeah but 8700k can still provide very good framerate.,far from the best but far from unplayable either.,it depends on your expectations.,if you are chasing 240hz performance then sure upgrade.,"if you are happy with 60fps single player games then there is no point, you should upgrade your display instead.",coding and video editing on a 1080p screen doesn't make much sense to me.,you can get some good displays for less than $300.,if i were you i would put my money on a good screen instead of a cpu/mobo upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do yourself a favor and buy a new monitor.,i guess for video editing you'd benefit from an 1440p ultrawide.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean that's a pretty decent setup.,you're likely guaranteed to be future-proof in 1440p for the next few years and if you're falling behind just upgrade your cpu and you'll be good to go again for a couple more.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it'll do just fine.,although i would consider upgrading the display to 1440p/144 to reduce bottlenecking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you need really high refresh rates?,do the games you play tax the cpu?,"sure, you may well find that your gpu is now capable than your cpu at 1080p with current games and that your fps is limited.","however, do you need higher than you can already achieve?","if not, then don't bother upgrading.","if you want 1440p then great, upgrade the monitor and it'll be more balanced, however if you don't want that then again, don't bother.",a 2080 was a 1440p to 4k card 3 years ago.,it's now considered a 1080p card.,that'll be the 3080 in 2-3 years with new games at that time.,"the idea of upgrading monitor just to add load to a gpu to balance things, when the bigger monitor isn't wanted is crazy imo.",the 8700 is still very capable.,it's almost exactly the same in spec and performance as the 10600k which was pretty much the default intel gaming cpu at the time of the 3080 release.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what monitor?,hz?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i mean, 13th gen intel and amd 7000 is just around the corner this month.",so just hold out some more week and you'll be bombarded with reviews to get an up to date of how the various hardware perform and which route you want to go.,"intel will have the benefit this time around though with ddr4, but ddr5 has been going down quite a lot in price and supply so it's not as bad as when 12th gen intel just got our",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i went from oc'd (5ghz) 8700k to mildly oc'd 12700k (5.2ghz) with 3080 and have no regrets.,the cache and ipc of the 12700k are drastically better.,i'm gaming on a 1440p/165hz monitor and can usually keep fps maxed at 165fps g-syned with ultra settings in the games i play.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"my i5-8400 was bottlenecking my evga2080 bad, so i upgraded to a 8700k and now itâ€™s gucci.",if you play a game where both cpu and gpu utilization are low (like assetto corsa) then itâ€™s all good.,i was getting cpu bottleneck in cyberpunk which is why i upgraded.,"i can also say for certain that the cpu bottlenecked less/not at all in 1440 when it was bottlenecking in 1080. 

but youâ€™re asking about upgrading.","get the i5-12600k (benchmarks and tests show it to be marginally slower than the 12900k for a fraction of the price) and you have a 10 core, 16 thread cpu and futureproof for a while",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

â€œalready hitting refresh rateâ€ does not = a good experience.,"older and slower cpus will appear to keep up with modern ones in benchmarks but in reality, when gameplay gets intense (like explosions and other effects) the older cpu will cause your fps to drop well below your refresh rate, while newer cpu like 12th gen intel will not do this.",also there are very noticeable latency benefits to running games at fps much higher than your refresh rate in general,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

your screen resolution doesnâ€™t matter.,it depends on your gpuâ€™s usage.,"if gpu usage in game is lower than 80%, it is bottlenecked by your cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4790 only enabled 13% usage of 2080ti in overwatch with unlocked frame rate.,"after switching to 9600kf, usage jumped to 65% immediately.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
untrue.,you underestimate how cpu hungry somes games can be (even single player ones) and how fast modern gpus can be.,at 1080p you'll struggle not to be cpu limited at some point.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1080p doesn't sound future proof.,it didn't even sound future proof 5 years ago.,there will never be the best future proof rig.,"you would be more future proof and it would be cheaper to got for a gpu like 3060, 3060 ti or 3070. then get a 5000 series mid tier gpu and sell your old one.",that would be cheaper than a 3080 and you have more power when you actually need it in the future.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this means you bough 3080 for 1080p gaming.,you should upgrade your cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i meant get a motherboard that supports the new cpus and ddr4.,the new until chips support ddr4 and ddr5 so you have to make sure you get one that supports ddr4 specifically.,your current board will not support anything beyond a 9900k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

then what would you be looking to gain by upgrading the cpu?,personally i'd stick with what you have and upgrade if and when the time arises your cpu is limiting the performance to the point you don't get what you want.,no point spending money just to get a higher number on a benchmark.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it will be a huge upgrade from the 8700,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the explanation !,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dont know why you get downvoted lol.,but to be fair.,its a lot to do with gpu usage.,and going from 8700k to 12th gen will give some tech system upgrades thats underrated.,"easy example will be the pciexpress 3 to 4.

personally i would wait longer, but thats an individual decision about priorities and economy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
screen resolution does matter.,"at 8k, the 8700k will not be a bottleneck.","at 480p, the 8700k will absolutely be a bottleneck.",looking up gpu utilization just confirms whether or not you're experiencing a gpu bottleneck at your current resolution.,"mind you that at some point, every cpu in existence will come out as the bottleneck.",the reverse is true at the other end too.,such is the power of the resolution slider.,"so arguably, all that matters in this discussion is resolution ðÿ˜¬.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

screen resolution absolutely does not matter lol.,your fps does.,the reason why cpus seem to bottleneck less at higher resolution is because your fps usually drops when going to higher resolutions when you keep the same graphical settings.,if you run a game at 1080p and 1440p at the exact same fps (meaning you lowered settings when using 1440p) then the cpu bottleneck will be the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
read my post carefully plz.,"if u have a 8k screen but set your game resolution to 1080p, why does your screen resolution matter?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

well of you wanna slide me 500 shmacks for an i9 then by all means,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well it's all up to your budget im just giving recommendations but i am getting the 12700k myself (i already bought it),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you'll honestly get a far better experience upgrading your monitor to 1440p than a cpu upgrade, especially if you're just aiming for 120hz.",your 3080 can handle that resolution easily.,why not stretch that 8700 a couple more years?,it's still a solid cpu especially at 1440p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i found this setup to be slightly quicker and run notably cooler than all p-cores at 5.1, and it's more stable too.",it's nice to be able to set the speed at the individual core level in bios and that they let you know which cores are the preferred on your chip to take advantage of that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is not true at all.,"resolution is one of the purest gpu-only settings, meaning increasing resolution incurrs almost no tax on the cpu.","almost all other graphical settings have more of an effect on the cpu as well, though it will differ from setting to setting.","you may be able to achieve the same average fps at low to medium settings at 1440p versus very high on 1080p, but you can absolutely bet that cpu utilization will not be the same.","however you're right in another aspect, which kind of aligns with my point - that it is impossible to say what the 'bottleneck' is unless you know the exact workload.",changing resolution or settings or even adding background tasks may change what the effective bottleneck is in your situation.,bottlenecks are also kind of overrated since there will - almost always - be a component that isn't utilized to 100%.,"all things must be perfectly balanced, but at some point it's not because there's really a problem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i concur that if you're distinguishing between game and screen resolution, and by screen resolution you mean native monitor resolution, then it is irrelevant.",but this has little to do with careful reading - why on earth would anyone be talking about native monitor resolution here?,you're the only one who brought that into the discussion - the other mentions are of a resolution by itself.,"i think it's safe to assume the other person was talking about game resolution - because, you know, that is relevant, and this is a common question asked a lot.","and also, even if your monitor is native 4k, if the game resolution is 1080p arguably the screen resolution becomes 1080p.","(litterally, because 4k to 1080p is a perfect 4:1 ratio, so the excess pixels become subpixels in what amounts to an effective 1080p screen resolution with a 1080p game resolution with a 4k native monitor resolution).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's actually more than a 20 frame difference.,the general single thread difference from 8th to 12th gen is pretty massive.,i doubled my performance in rpcs3 and a few other cpu intensive applications.,"at 1080p, your cpu definitely is the limiting factor rn

but the 8700k is definitely still a capable cpu without a doubt, just like a ryzen 2700x would be",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
na wait for 13th or 14th,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i misread what you said, my apologies, i'm now leaning towards a new monitor",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thank you, i'm honestly starting to lean towards a monitor upgrade instead.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"about your first 2 points, yes you are correct.","however, achieving the same fps at two different resolutions generally means that the gpu load is the same.","there is a reason why if you test an rtx 3050 and a 3090 both at 1080p, cpu bottleneck will happen much more with 3090. this is because the 3090 can take on much larger graphical load and output more fps as a result.","if you could force the game to utilize only say 20-30% of the 3090 forcing it to perform like a 3050, the cpu bottleneck would go away.","in this case, your resolution will not have changed at all, but the cpu leverage changed.",why is that?,"again, the factor that changed in thise case is your fps, not resolution.","another example, whenever you are cpu bound at any resolution you will almost never see an increase in fps by turning down the graphical settings, or very little fps increase - this is widely documented, you can look it up.","many users have suffered from this problem, but as soon as they upgraded their cpu they were able to gain tons of fps from reducing quality settings.",in this example the resolution doesnâ€™t change at all once again.,these examples clearly indicate that resolution itself has nothing to do with cpu leverage.,"rather, it is the gpu utilization that matters.","now you are absolutely correct that increasing resolution increases the load placed on the gpu thus reducing your fps, which in turn will make cpu bottleneck less noticeable.","but at the same time, if you equalize the load on the gpu at two different resolutions, which would result in equal fps, the cpu leverage will be the same.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all right i hope it helps with your choice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the gpu and cpu leverage are not the same because the fps is the same, that's completely wrong.",and average fps by itself isn't the best metric of performance anyway.,if you want to be specific you need a frame graph or at least 1 and 10% lows.,there's also the fact that having bottlenecks isn't terrible.,it's about how bad the bottleneck is too.,i think it''s  generally better for fluidity to have the gpu as the bottlenecks since most frametime spikes are cpu based.,but that's in cases where performance is barely sufficient.,"if you have sufficient performance, i'd say it's not bad to have a minor cpu bottleneck as games become more demanding graphically faster than otherwise.",so with future games the load will shift and you may still achieve 100% gpu utilization even without increasing resolution.,the fact that with increasing resolution the bottleneck shifts from cpu to gpu and vice versa is incredibly well established.,your understanding of fps as a metric is just off.,these bottleneck debates are mostly interesting when you're balancing a budget and you know the typical workloads.,if you don't have a budget just buy the optimal product on both sides of the aisle.,"if you don't know the workload, your advice could well be wrong.",eg counterstrike 1080p low settings is almost always cpu constrained.,cyberpunk 2077 ultra at 4k is almost always gpu constrained.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the dell 7506 appears to come with an intel h-series hybrid optane/ssd.,"in that case, optane memory is automatically used to speed up access times to the built-in ssd.","thatâ€™s all it does, and thatâ€™s likely what itâ€™s already doing.","most consumers do not see noticeable benefits from optane unless they are running certain latency-sensitive workloads, like a heavy database server.","more noticeable in my mind is the halving of potential ssd sequential throughout, as each half of the hybrid drive only gets x2 pcie 3.0 lanes.","thatâ€™s basically like taking a modern pcie 4.0 x4 ssd and running it at x1, or quarter speed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that may be normal for your workload.,it's going to vary based on what all you have running.,"my laptop right now has 273k handles with just email, browser, antivirus, teams and a few other apps running.",on a server i manage i see almost 1.5m handles on a hyper-v host with around half a dozen vm's on it.,it's nothing to worry about unless you have a particular symptom you are trying to diagnose.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"x99 cpu's at the time of release had a hard time running any significant memory overclocks, over time it did get better but the cpu's don't benefit all that much from higher speed memory.",i even had a hard time getting a set of 2600mhz ram that would work on my 6850k until a few bios updates came out.,i ultimately upgraded because my motherboard developed some weird issues and it would have cost me more to buy a replacement motherboard than it would have been to buy a 8 core amd cpu and a motherboard.,"the feature set of x99 is also really outdated now, most motherboards cannot boot nvme and the pcie slots only run at 3.0 speeds which isn't ideal for modern gpu's.","my advice would be if you can afford to, upgrade, even a modern consumer platform will perform better if you don't need a large amount of pcie lanes and if you do need a silly number of pcie lanes you will be well served by a second hand threadripper.",x299 is in a similar situation where its really not advisable to buy into and there is seemingly no equivalent on the horizon any time soon from the intel side.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you can go for high core count e5 v3 or v4 xeons.,advantage of v3 is that you can turbo hack them to get max turbo working for all cores and they are less expensive.,you also can just oc your cpu to get some performance increase.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you'll definitely have some improvements, but the question is how much your cpu's imc can actually handle.",but you'd get a far bigger increase in performance buying a 12600k and reusing your ddr4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">my question is, i was thinking of upgrading my memory to 64gb 3300mhz.",is it worth upgrading?,ddr4 is so cheap and so useful in a workstation i would have upgraded that to at least 32 gb a long time ago (jumped up to 128gb recently).,i would not expect the faster frequency to make much difference though given the age of the processor.,"if you're ok with 8 cores and want to stick with intel for mkl, alder/raptor lake would be a pretty big upgrade for single threaded stuff, and maybe you can get some value out of the e cores as well.",not that expensive either.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i'm on x99 still, 5930x.",i bought 32gb of corsair dominator a little while back and it's incompatible.,not sure why tbh but certainly didn't work.,thinking it was just because the bios hasn't had a revision since 2019 (mobos a rampage 5 extreme).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you need the cores there's certainly better cpus.,"i'm pretty sure there's like an 18 core xeon for that platform, but clockspeed will be lower.",as for the single core the 5960x is very good and ocd to 4.5ghz isn't far off from new 8 core cpus.,"3200mhz will be the cap for ram depending on the imc, i'd focus on lowering timings",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes the the m.2 on my rampage board is only pcie3.,only reason x99 is still kicking for me is for multi-core and quad channel memory.,as workloads such as cfd benefits from cores and memory channel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"about a year ago i spent a long time researching what i would upgrade my x99 5930k cpu to, including all the mega-core count xeons, and did up a chart comparing all the specifications and effective speeds to help me decide.","if your workload involves a ton of rendering or easily scalable processes, those high core count xeons will really churn - but for normal daily use, the extra-slow single threaded clock speeds are a huge hinderance.","in the end, i abandoned going the xeon route and picked up the 6950x - while not the most powerful for multithreaded, probably the most well-rounded cpu available for x99, and it overclocked like a champ too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i actually stumbled upon a youtube video discussing that using the 18 core haswel-e xeon.,it's tempting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"certain workloads like cfd see a performance drop from quad to dual channel, that's partly why i haven't upgraded in a long while.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah fair, most open-source cfd simulation software has no core limit, and i can access research license for commercial code, so they can use as many cores as possible.","however i also like to run single threaded applications like cad and emulation as well, so it's like a tug-of-war between clock speed and core count",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
p.s.,"ram i'm running now is 16gb dominator platnium @ 3600 mhz, been running that since 2014, new kit was 32gb @ 3200mhz both 4 stick kits if that helps.",i don't think it's a frequency thing in my case.,maybe just too much for the mem controller with more capacity but seems more like a bios compatibility thing to me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gpu's have only gotten to the point where pcie 3.0 is a problem in the last 2-3 years and in general intel were pretty late to the pcie 4.0 party.,x99 has so many quality of life issues like depending on what cpu you out in your motherboard it changes all of your pcie lane allocations and you may loose some functionality if you don't have one of the top end cpu's.,also most of them only have nvme slots running at 2.0 speeds and many even have them only running at sata speeds.,also the boards for the most part lack usb 3 and faster ports and this is especially bad on the lower end models with many having usb hubs onboard rather than multiple controllers which can make things like vr an absolute pain.,"they just aren't very liveable by modern standards plus the record for reliability on the platform is shockingly bad, everyone i know who upgraded to x99 at the same time as me had their motheboards fail in one way or another.","x99 singlehandedly turned me off of ever buying a early adoptor hedt platform ever again, if i had just keept my 4790k for 1-2 more years the experience would be so much better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there were decent boards available.,"the asus tuf x99 sabertooth i bought in 2015 has a pcie 3.0 m.2 slot (does work at full speed, although not sure whether it can boot from it - need to replace the gpu before i finish rebuilding the system).","the x99 chipset itself supports 6 usb 3.0 ports, and the tuf even added dual gen2 10gbit ports.","frankly, the thing has held up really well feature-wise for its age.","i had a major system failure on it last october and thought my motherboard had died (itâ€™s been on 24x7 since 2015), but turns out the gpu had failed instead.","so the system lives for another dayâ€¦ however with many of the cheap modern gpus being pcie 4.0 x4 or x8, thatâ€™s not a great fit for a 3.0 system, so iâ€™ve held off buying anything, but the ancient x1950xt i slapped in is not uefi friendly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"from what i remember there were only 2 boards at launch that supported bootable nvme and they were the top rog and top msi board, later on a couple of the top end boards did get it added in bios updates but it wasn't all that many of them (the asus x99 deluxe 2 i owned never got it despite being the 2nd best board asus sold) 

the issue with the usb was that quite often the stock usb would be allocated as internal headers leaving 2 from the chipset, usually ran into hubs for the lower end models and the higher end models having multiple onboard usb controllers which was sometimes great, other times a nuisance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i've always ignored these ""benchmarks"".",how do they have a 12100 above a 12400?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nor really i will wait for official reviews.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s not feeling very â€œrealisticâ€ to me.,the multicore score is positioned as 8% above the 12700 and nearly identical to the 12700k.,"but the 12700 is 8+4 cores with a 4.9/3.4 all core boost, while the 13700 is going to be 8+8 cores with a rumoured 5.1/4.1 all core speed.",thatâ€™s much better than even the 12900 with 8+8 and 4.7/3.6.,"along with other raptor lake improvements, i would expect the 13700â€™s real scores to be very similar if not better than that cpu, which would be at least 15% higher than the 12700, probably much more.","if thatâ€™s not the case, than either the rumored speeds are all wrong, or the ipc is going to be way lower on raptor lake than alder lake, which makes no sense.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"interesting benchmark result, but with situations of sample sizes of 1 (there are 2 score submissions, but seemingly from the same system ([score 1](https://www.passmark.com/baselines/v10/display.php?id=161744548580) and [score 2](https://www.passmark.com/baselines/v10/display.php?id=161745332054)), so effectively the ""same"" submission), i'm usually just a bit wary.","it's just that ""take with a grain of salt"".","also, it looks like a kind of weird hardware configuration.","according to the actual benchmark result, it looks like it's using an h610 matx mobo (and possibly the ddr5 variant, since the mobo name doesn't list the d4 in it) with only 16gb of ram.","i don't happen to know where the numbers ""should"" be for 2x8gb vs 1x16gb for the memory portion of the benchmark, so i'm not sure what configuration they're actually using.",either configuration is probably not ideal.,"but, regardless, i'd assume that with the chip on a better board with better memory, the benchmark score can only go up from there.","this almost seems like a worst-case scenario benchmark for this chip (probably power-limited by the mobo and not a ""good"" memory setup).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you were talking about st scores, yes 12100 is above 12400, but by how much?",0.01%?,"they were made by the same gen tech without overclocking, ofc their st scores are closeâ€¦",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wdym?,"12100 is 14000 points, 12400 is nearly 20000 pointsâ€¦",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it is not surprising at this time the score of 13700 is close to 12700k, because 12700k users overclocks crazy to make their scores higher.","but 13700 non-k cannot, although it has 4 more e cores, but the bios maybe not optimized.",so the scores should be reliable at this time.,"maybe in 1-2 months, when the bios for 13th gen gets optimized, 13700 will score 10% higher.","all in all, iâ€™m not an e-core fanboy at all, so i do not recommend you to put faith on those 4 e cores too much.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably an es configuration of some kind with low all core boost or similar.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
agree!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"however that doesnâ€™t explain why itâ€™s significantly slower than the 12900, which also canâ€™t be overclocked, when the 13700 will essentially be a higher clocked, improved version of the 12900.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
interesting.,"i was just messing with the integrated uhd 750 on my 11700k, and the results for directx 12 and vulkan seemed to be smooth, but dx11 and 9 had some issues.","not the same architecture, but a similar performance trend.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is different architecture as the drivers are different.,if it's iris xe it's more similar but it's just on mobile.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that board will be fine for those two cpus.,the only reason to want the 12100 would be for budget.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it will be fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah it's for budget but i might upgrade to i5 - 12400f in the future.,edit: spelling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you may as well go for the 12400 now if youâ€™re already thinking about upgrading.,"in gaming it wonâ€™t have a major effect aside from better 1% lows, but with 4 cores itâ€™s tough to run discord or browsers in the background and not feel the performance drop.",go for 6 cores unless youâ€™re on a strict budget imo.,or if youâ€™re only going to game and not stream or hang in discord or have youtube open then 12100 is fine!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you can squeeze out the money for a 12400f i would rly do that since it is a pretty big difference between 12100 with 4 cores 12mb l3 cache and the 12400f with 6 cores and 18mb l3 cache, and the 12400f is rly future proof as a gaming cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yep, pretty much.","when youâ€™re plugged in, the amount of power you can draw is limited only by thermals, so the cpu boosts to its full power limit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"well, thatâ€™s certainly one way to avoid killing your own 13600k.","seems like both intel and amd are killing the $200 gaming cpu for good this gen, shame on them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i wonder if this makes sense this gen due to demand dropping in the pc space?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they likely will eventually but unless intel fuck them up this gen it probably won't happen until close to the end of the cycle of the 7000. i'm okay with this decision for the most part since lower end alder lake is already good value and this might cause them to go down even lower in price.,"if these cpus suck, nothing's loss, 12th gen is still great.","if you already went for lower end 12th gen then either you shouldn't be thinking of upgrading yet because i assume your budget was small and meant for gaming and premium cpus are not much use for gamers, or you bought it as a holdover, in which case you should be thinking of at least 13600k so this shouldn't affect you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

do we know for sure it's recycled adl-s dies (8+8 32 xe cores) and not adl-p (6+8 but 96 xe cores)?,i guess the 2 extra big cores are smaller than the extra igpu..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel has a low end.,that already makes it a massive win because amd's cheapest cpu is $300.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

amd has nothing under $300.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why?,"amd is unlikely to have anything under $300 for a long time, intel will have ddr4 advantage and it's not like these alder lake re-brands are bad.","you are getting higher clocks, e-cores for some skus and more l2/l3 cache.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"complete misread of the market

intel dominates the low-end because they have no competition, and their products there are actually quite good (see 12100->12400).",they also are dominating the high end.,"the market share gain of amd, although a significant threat to intel, is not as much of an existential threat as many ayymd fanbois think it is on reddit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
theyâ€™re still going to win the low end by just having affordable but powerful cpus available.,the alder lake 13600 is going to be way overkill compute power for the vast majority of users.,itâ€™s not like itâ€™s a slow processor ðÿ˜‚,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

13400 will be based on 12600k refresh so around 5800x performance vs 12400 5600x performance.,others also get similar bumps.,celeries and pentiums are where i donâ€™t think we get much boost,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my thought is if i ever upgrade my alder lake secondary computer, i'll get a high-end raptor lake cpu to be sure i'm getting the actual next-gen refresh.","for now though, my i3-12100 is plenty good enough as an auxiliary obs/1080p capturing computer :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

a rebranded 12600k to a 13400 at a price around 200 dollars is a deal breaker.,the 12400f has been the cpu to buy for months compared to the 5600x before the r5 it came down to 200 euros to match the 12400f.,"the 7600x has a high price tag, to high in my opinion compared to what you can get for less money even at the current moment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what are you even on about?,"the 5600 is under $160

ig but this is just allowing them to get rid of older stock.,"honestly not that bad, amd did the same thing with 4000s series but that was shit cuz of how it was priced and how it performed compared to the intel competition",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"they aren't bashing them for clicks, they're upset that intel decided to milk consumers instead of innovating for the better part of a decade until they made an actual effort to compete with a resurgent amd.","and unless you've been living under a rock, reviewers actually recommend intel chips for pretty much every price point except for the flagship for multi-threaded work.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"unless youâ€™re running a 3080ti or 3090, you arenâ€™t going to see major improvements.","if you have a cheaper card, youâ€™d be better off upgrading that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
amd will 100 per cent say it is faster than the 12900k for gaming and it is more efficient that is why the i5 lineup although as fast as a 7700x in multi core and very fast in gaming does not matter.,it is basically zen 1 vs the 7700k but in reverse.,"i hope intel strikes back, however it will not be with the 13th gen... we need competition...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 5600 and 12400f are really neck and neck, gamers nexus and hardware unboxed did some good comparison videos a few months ago.",any gains the 13400 has over the 12400 will put it ahead of the 5600 and amd currently has no answer to that potential.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but you donâ€™t need a node shrink to increase ipc.,"if you want to increase ipc, it is possible on a larger lithographic node, but it takes significantly more power and die space to accomplish the same performance.","i agree that node shrinks are a good way to attain the ability to increase ipc using a similar area, but correlation doesnâ€™t equal causation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>rocket lake wasn't a pure upgrade across the board the way alder lake was.,"yes, but it did bring more ipc without a newer node",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
new node isn't the only way to generate big ipc gains.,"back in the tick-tock era, there wasn't a reliable pattern of new node equals biggest upgrades.","indeed, most people think sandy bridge was the best generation of that era, and it uses the same 32nm process node that it's predecessor westmere did.",the reason skylake++++ was so dull was that it was the same node and the same cpu architecture.,the reason rocket lake had mixed results is that the architecture was designed for 10nm and backported to 14nm.,a modern example of big ipc gains on same node is zen 3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no i'm sure i'm bottleneck on the cpu since i have a r5 3600.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes exactly this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pretty sure raptorlake matches zen 4 gaming performance at the least,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i know.,they're not better.,it's the same thing.,with amd having an architectural change and intel not its not a good sign for intel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
node shrinks is literally how we've reached the point in processing power we're at today over the last 5 decades.,the current events where it's getting harder and harder to keep it going is a physics limit.,that's why things are slowing down.,"and no man, the truth is ""not really"" does ipc usually increase comparing chips on the same node.",you can look back over the last 20 years and see that's not really true.,they never needed to try much before because they were constantly upgrading the transistor sizes to smaller and smaller ones year over year.,skylake and its children is a glimpse into the future when intel can't keep progressing down in process size.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"only in some cases, it lost ipc in others.",see how that works?,"it's almost like they don't have more silicon on the chip, just rearranged and reprioritized certain elements to bolster certain calculations ***while taking away from others***.",that's what happens when you try to make a significant architecture change on the same node.,you can't just magically make it better without giving *something* up.,it's not 1990 anymore where there was still a lot of inefficiency in design that could be made up for optimization on the same process.,these things are tight.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, but a 5800x3d is complete overkill unless you have a 3080 at least.","5600x is plenty, 5800x even has prices dropping.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if i want the best on am4 it is the 5800x3d.,"with that, i knew my am4 will last for atleast 3 years until amd and intel find a way to outperform each other that will make the 5800x3d obsolete",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for gaming, situationally, the 5800x3d is the best on am4, i would still rather buy a 5900x or 5950x once prices nosedive though, especially if gaming isnâ€™t the only thing youâ€™re going to be doing on it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'd say just keep the money in your pocket for now and use it for a much more meaningful upgrade, such as 13th gen when it comes, or even snag 12th gen on the cheap after 13th gen launches and they try to move old inventory.",that would be a much more meaningful way to go.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

honestly it wont make much of a difference going from 9600k to 9900k.,i would recommend going for 13600k when it releases in october.,the difference would be amazing.,13600k + z790 + your old ddr4 will be a beast,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks.,"i was thinking perhaps the higher stock clocks, better binning of the 9900k vs the 9600k and just simply getting another draw in the silicon lottery could get me a couple of fps while i'm waiting for the 13600k or perhaps 14600k or ryzen 4 3d, or for as long as it takes for ddr5 pricing to become more reasonable.","but if i see something like +1 or +2 fps, i'm not going to be a happy man.","although the cpu itself will probably manage to sell for about the same price, so the money (or, say, 80% of it) would be frozen but not wasted â€” which is my primary incentive for the purchase.","then again, bf is 2.5 months away.","and as much as i like second-hand hardware, i prefer to buy from sellers who can be relied on to report the income and pay their taxes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

scythe coolers are remarkably solid pieces of metalwork but the fans they tend to come with are woefully underpowered.,swap them for noctua industrial 2000/3000 rpm (better than what comes with standard noctua coolers) and you're golden.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
around 25min.,more then adequate to completely heat soak any air cooling solution.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that's exactly my personal plan.,":)

i've bought the ninja 5 rev.b, and i'm planning to get the f12 3000 ippc soon after rpl comes.","someone prob downvoted you because of the noise, but it's not like a 3000rpm fan is gonna be set at 100% all the time in a desktop usage scenario.",just when it's needed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you suggest replacing both fans with the f12?,"also, aren't they thicker than the front fan of the scythe?",won't it hit the ram?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> around 25min.,more then adequate to completely heat soak any air cooling solution.,"i want to believe, but i don't understand how you're able to push 250w on a adl cpu with a fuma 2. when i tested it on comet lake, it throttled at about ~210w in cinebench - and adl is harder to cool.",even the strongest coolers i've tested struggle with 250w loads over a long term,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

do you suggest replacing both fans with the f12?,"also, aren't they thicker than the front fan of the scythe?",won't it hit the ram?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've personally put one noctua ippc fan on scythe ninja 5. the cooler's size is such that mounting a rear fan on it won't fit; the case exhaust fan is just a centimeter away and acting as a second fan for it.,"in all other regards, size is no issue; with the exception of specific slim fans, all of them are the same thickness and the cooler has specific indent for ram clearance.","if the ram ends up under the fan, you can just mount the fan a couple heatsink ribs higher.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
replacing the fans on fuma 2 will be trickier because of their opposing rotational directions.,"but the rev.b already has 1500 rpm fans, so you should at least see how it performs out of the box first with your cpu.","then, *if* you still want higher rpm/pressure, you'll need to experiment, but i'd start from using just 1 in the middle, without any of the stock kazes, then i'd see what happens if i add the thin front one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

those memory bandwidths on the high end are a bit disappointing and will definitely hold the cards back in some titles.,using a 3070ti i get 50gb/s more bandwidth than an a770.,either way i really hope intel can break into the market with these.,personally probably won't be buying an intel gpu for awhile but the competition in the market is needed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as soon as i can pre-order one of these i will.,if it's anything like the a380 i have it's crazy fast for video rendering tasks.,faster than my 3070ti for av1 exports and similar for hevc and h.264.,for gaming it's not bad but the drivers need more stability as rust and other games will keep crashing it although it's improved since the last driver release.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i agree.,i'm still willing to consider arc for my coming build but the window of price/performance is getting narrower every day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
guess it depends on your perspective.,"they're marketing the a770 as a rasterization competitor to the 3060 ti and a rt competitor to the 3060, and it will likely be priced accordingly.",it has a decent leg up over those gpus in memory bandwidth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well that's a bit more reasonable then if that's what they're actually aiming for.,"they really need to stop referring to them as ""high end"" though if that's the case because that gives people the wrong idea about performance expectations.",when i hear a card described as high end i immediately start thinking about it as a competitor for 3080 and up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i agree.,"they seem to be using ""high end"" and ""mid range"" for where the gpus are positioned in their stack rather than where they're positioned relative to the overall gpu market.",but hopefully pricing gives everyone a clear indication of where these products perform.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i actually think a 240/280mm aio would be fine as intel has made a few optimizations to die height/thickness so the 13th gen chips run a bit cooler than 12th gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes some benefits but new release prices are never fun to deal with.,only you can decide if its worth it or not.,personally not bothering with a 790 my z690 is a top of the line board that can take 13th gen already.,wont be upgrading past a new 13th gen cpu anytime soon for myself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

real question now is ddr5 or ddr4 :p",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wouldn't say guaranteed.,also there weren't issues like this in the past like when z370 boards were able to support 9th gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"since day one, 12th gen boards have been available with onboard pcie 5.0 m.2 slots, or dual pcie 5.0 x8 slots with a bundled pcie 5.0 m.2 card.","literally nothing has changed or improved in this department with raptor lake - except maybe it might become more common on high-end boards, since weâ€™re getting closer to 5.0 actually being useful.","bifurcation still also only supports x16 and x8/x8 modes, there is no x8/x4/x4 which would have been useful for adding dual m.2s.","about the only useful change is more chipset pcie 4.0 lanes, which should mean no more pcie 3.0 m.2 slotsâ€¦ and another year of motherboard layout optimizations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are they finally giving more pcie lanes?,it seems like i've been hoping for this for 20 years now!,sure you could pay twice as much for a server motherboard with many obsolete features but that never made any sense to me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nope.,13th gen is still just 16 pcie 5.0 + 4 pcie 4.0. the expected bump up to 20 pcie 5.0 did not happen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how long do you think before the prices go down?,i am waiting for my 13900k to be delivered and now would need to decide between z690 and pricey z790.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"from what iâ€™m aware only the enthusiast tier boards allow for this, but maybe iâ€™m mistaken.",i havenâ€™t looked that deeply into z690 since i wasnâ€™t planning an upgrade when they first released.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"hard to say i know some places the 13th gen was a bit higher on their ""msrp"" that what was speculated by intel pricing.",as for the 13900k i would lean towards a board that does ddr5 ram with that cpu .,z790 is tempting but those minor changes from a z690 to a z790 don't seem to have that good value since a vast majority of the z790 boards are closer to 300 some are 200 dollars,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"definitely agreed, great points there my friend.",thank you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iirc most of the bottlenecks from overclocking ram is the imc and not the board.,at least on ddr4 that is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"true, but thatâ€™s more due to the cost of the pcie 5.0 switch involved in routing lanes from one place to another, which is still needed, and may make it similarly scarce on 13th gen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks - bummer they don't offer more total lanes.,"by the time you deduct lanes for usb ports, sound cards, hard drives etc.",there is barely enough left for one card such as a video card.,i have a raid controller and a 4 port 10g nic in addition to a video card.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tis a shame.,"a ddr4 board with gen5 m.2 and graphics support would make for a killer future-proof build to last through the end of ddr5, i think.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think it can have 4 8x lanes with 2 m.2's,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, thatâ€™s one thing iâ€™m hoping will improve on 700 boards - there basically were no enthusiast ddr4 600 boards.","and back when ddr5 was in shortage, if you wanted a premium board with dual pcie 5 slots or thunderbolt or good audio, you were basically stuck with ddr5.",i think motherboard makers did themselves a disservice by not having a full range of z690 ddr4 boards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it's not the sum of l2 + l3 cache that counts for gaming, it's the sum of a single core's l2 + l3 that counts.","that said, the 13600k will likely be close to the 12900k based on clock speeds.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it can be turned on but it's not guaranteed out of the box.,using the +2 profile in an asus bios will also give you hilariously high vids due to the default vid table.,think something like 1.4v+ for the tvb.,"so when intel says 5.8ghz tvb, they mean the default multiplier is 58x until xx c where it drops to 57x.",abt is more useful for real world situations but it's going to run super hot for medium loads since it'll want to turbo to 57x as much as possible when enabled.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'm confused on that final slide.,"""up to 16x pci express 5.0"" on the right, but also ""1x16 pcie 5.0 readiness lanes + 1x4 pcie 4.0 lanes.""",what's the difference?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
some pcie cards use 8x like sas and some 10/25gb+ ethernet cards and some 100gb ethernet cards use 16x so z790 is very useful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's actually useful to me.,"i'm not in a position to afford something as hefty as threadripper or a server-class cpu, but lack of sufficient pcie lanes is really annoying for higher resolution video editing and fx.",i'd love to have a bunch of high capacity gen 4 drives in raid without breaking the bank.,"20 or 24 lanes has been the cap until moving to hedt for a while, so i'd welcome a slight increase.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah just sticking with z690 ddr4 until ddr5 actually shows across the board gaming performance improvement.,not just one remastered game.,gen 13 will be marginally faster in single core.,almost does not matter amd vs intel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

same.,"i don't understand why the 12700kf went from $321 one day to $380 a couple of days later...i think they're just trying to squeeze as much profit out before slashing prices upon arrival of the13th gen, or at least i hope.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"itâ€™s a solid guess, though amd just made avx512 standard on all 7000 series,  so who knows how intel will respond.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
correct.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you misread the boost clock as base clock.,"it's ""up to"" meaning it's boost clock not the base clock.",will you achieve 5.8ghz?,"yes with sufficient cooling

will you achieve 5.8ghz everytime?",nope,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
remember the 2x to 3x transients on the cpu and 2x transients on the gpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's just a function of the additional cores, the p-cores each have 2mb and each 4-core e-core cluster has 4mb.","this is an improvement compared to alder lake though, which was 1.25mb for the p-cores and 2mb for the e-core cluster.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hey i thought i recognized something familiar about your username!,you frequent the amd stock sub lol.,which explains this take.,"for general users, especially gamers, the energy usage from the cpu between amd and intel is going to minimal.",which is what this article is about- client desktop diy builders.,"youâ€™re right, in servers, companies are switching over to amd.",but this bears little to no relevance* edit to the actual post lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah yes, imagine how much money you will save by running a 220w 7950x compared to a 250w 13900k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it depends on the workload and it depends on the idle power consumption.,it is dynamic.,which is why intel publish the dynamic boost tables and full documentation.,amd's documentation is a bit lacking but there process technology is good.,intel is catching up at a torrid pace however.,intel 4 is just around the corner.,and so is sapphire rapids.,but amd will be on tsmc n5.,excellent.,workloads are dynamic.,work completed divided by overall power used is the bar.,different cpus do better for different workloads.,idle time is another consideration.,along with overall costs and support.,all are factors.,no one design can rule them all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in other words, amd good, intel bad.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"well, just look at previous gen cpus when it comes to the i5 or i7 line up.",12600k is just about the same performance as a 11900k.,"so, wouldn't be surprsied if 12900k is about the same as 13600k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its 2mb l2 per p core for all of them.,up from 1.25mb.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's the config it can support.,you can have 2 8x slots or 1 16x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think the right side just shows the amount and the left, how the lanes can be split.","kinda confusing tho, you are right.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the problem here is that everything you connect to chipset is bottlenecked by dmi link which hasnt changed.,so while you can connect more if you start using them at the same time you lose performance.,z690 has similar number of lanes.,they are just gen3 instead of 4. they removed most of the gen3s and added 4 which is good but the price diff is probably a lot.,in hedt eveything goes directly to cpu.,while these chipsets are a big step up than previous gens they are still limited.,good enough for me though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that depends on price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you can achieve 5.8ghz if it is listed as the turbo boost.,you don't need sustained loads.,it's like my vehicle can hit 8000 rpm but i don't run it at a sustained 8000 rpm everyday.,let's say you drive a 500 hp vehicle.,you aren't outputting 500 hp everyday you are on the road huffing at 25 or 35 mph.,instead you are maybe at 100 hp depending on the conditions and engine load.,but you have the capacity to hit 500 hp at peak rpm and engine load.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

he's saying that any core on the 13600k will be able to access the entire 44mb of l2+l3 cache on the cpu.,"i'm saying any core will be able to access it's own l2 + l3, meaning 26mb effectively.",there's a slight difference...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

its been great.,once it got a few years old i bought a liquid cooler and got a 14% overclock out of it too.,i'm thinking time for a full upgrade.,maybe 13900k.,13700k if specs/price are worth it.,i figure if a cpu lasts 6-7 years its worth it.,i started looking a few years back but was underwhelmed.,i can also keep using this pc for a few more years in my game room or recording music etc.,it still preforms really well.,i just find for photo/video editing and crazy multi thread stuff i need the upgrade,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
shops listing higher price is probably just that they have no idea what the price will be so they list something that is sure to be higher number so they can have the listing ready and nobody complaining about false advertisement or price hikes.,i donâ€™t think intel tells anyone what the pricing is before announcement.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"as he said, there is no such difference between the competitors.",50w is more likely to be near the total power consumption for gaming workload for the 300â‚¬ cpu than the difference between two cpus.,on normal office use you will hover around 5-25w depending on cpu.,and amd doesnâ€™t really have an edge there with the chiplet design causing some overhead.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"electricity cost is usually a bad argument for cpus unless you do some high intensity workloads such as run a render farm because that's the workload they use to measure ""energy efficiency"".",have you actually measured your average consumption in your normal daily use?,have you compared to what it would be with another cpu?,cinebench score per watt tells you literally nothing about that unless you run hours long renders daily.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"cooling ability is vastly worse on zen 3 products, and will be on zen 4 as well.",idle power consumption and temps are especially egregious thanks to the io.,"power consumption can be managed by reasonable power limits,  and only the top 12900/13900k are eyebrow raising when pushed to benchmarkig limits.",the average user won't see that power draw.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"l3 is non-inclusive in alder lake so if your application uses 6 cores, that's 7.5->12mb of l2 that can be preventing l3 thrash.","though with l2 and l3 almost at 1:1 ratio in raptor lake and the e-cores owning 16mb of them, you'd hope that intel figured some way to use parked l2 as a victim cache for l3 so the idle silicon isn't going to waste...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">the 9900k was not matched by the 10600k, and the 10900k was not matched by the 11600k...

they didnt more cache, more cores or whatever like raptor lake does",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"should be enough yeah, on paper at least.",this config needs a motherboard that implements it and its reserved for the mid to high end ones.,that's the appeal of boards like msi z690 carbon.,you can have two add in cards connected to the cpu.,fairly sure carbon/force is the cheapest one to have it.,16x pcie5 lanes just for gpu is a complete waste and this is really the only benefit of gen5 right now.,the bandwidth could matter years from now but not today.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel announced there will be big price hikes few months ago.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"thanks for creating an inclusive environment, bro.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
typically on intel itâ€™s actually two cores.,then a bit lower for four cores and a bit lower still for all cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
uh its so long and specific - what is the meaning?,is the point that 1000w wasnt be enough ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"historically i would agree, but with current energy prices, especially here in the uk, itâ€™s a valid metric to consider.",a system pulling ~400w from the wall will cost nearly â£0.25 ($0.30) per hour in electricity under the upcoming october energy price caps.,thatâ€™s â£365 ($420) per year based on 4 hours usage per day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sure, but that goes to show that there's no pattern",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel said they would be moving some of their inflationary cost increases to pricing later this year.,they did not â€œannounce big price hikesâ€.,but that doesnâ€™t change the fact that the shops donâ€™t know the price.,like they havenâ€™t in the previous generations.,the prices in their listings are placeholders.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes but you very likely donâ€™t have good data to compare.,for a typical use case the cpu will be mostly idle most of the time.,"i have a 3950x and my wife has i5-12500, her intel cpu consumes like one third of the power when idle.",or around 20-25w difference.,"but then there is the motherboard, chipset, memory and all that which also consume power.","when gaming i havenâ€™t noticed much difference between cpu architectures, generally bigger cpu consumes more.",something like cinebench tells you nothing about this.,in cinebench my 3950x would probably be massively more efficient than the 12500.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
actual single core boost would be pretty useless because more than one core is practically always active if you have an active user workload.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"my 400w estimate was extrapolated from my own systemâ€™s power draw at the wall when gaming, which is around 250w when iâ€™m playing rocket league (fairly low cpu load and medium gpu load on a 5800x and 1080 ti combo).",400w seems like a reasonable ballpark for an i7/i9 cpu and 3080 class gpu running a demanding aaa game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yep, i noticed that when overclocking and went with 4core / allcore settings.","even the 2 core setting was rarely actually applied, since windows always does .... windows things.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that might be reasonable due to gpu power consumption.,but thatâ€™s not really the topic here.,"however, for cpus itâ€™s not a reasonable assumption.",an 8 core intel cpu will probably consume about the same as 8 core amd in gaming.,and if there is an fps difference the difference in gpu power will be far bigger than the difference between cpus.,you have to work really hard to make even 12900k consume 100w in gaming.,efficiency comes from running reasonable clocks.,in something like cinebench my 3950x runs ~3.9ghz.,itâ€™s super efficient like that.,in gaming it runs 4.6ghz and is no longer at all as efficient.,"edit: that being said, if you want to save power this winter, limit your games to 60fps.",both the cpu and the gpu should see significant drop in power.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think it's more encoder limited than rather vram or ram limited which explains why the gpu doesn't use more vram.,a solution could be if possible installing msi afterburner and overclocking the memory to increase  bandwidth a bit beside that there aren't really solutions as far as i know unless ofcourse upgrading to a better gpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are at 90% usage.,that thing isnt suitable for your workload.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"your ""copy "" is high, but what else is high on the gpu?",are you seeing high utilization on any of the gpu performance categories?,that will help us understand the problem some more.,"doesn't appear as if you need more vram, as your gpu isn't hitting the ""shared gpu memory"" which is allocated by windows dynamically.",the shared gpu memory comes from the system ram.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe msi afterburner?,iâ€™m not sure if it supports that gpu though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can't imagine davinci resolve working well with 4gb of gpu memory and 4k footage.,resolve eats vram (and ram) for breakfast.,i tried editing 1080p heavy effects video with a old mac with 4gb radeon gpu.,"gave up, couldn't handle it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
arc is riddled with driver issues i think i read a few weeks ago that a driver fix caused a 50-70 performance gains on some loads,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
many thanks.,i think i understand.,"so intuitively, there is no need to store more content in memory as the ""brain"" cannot process more content.",i have a few [egpu options](https://imgur.com/a/rusmy5n) to experiment.,"i also want to experiment, disabling the arc and just use the xe graphics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks.,"it is worth a try, i have nothing to lose -in some of my amd gpu i remember a setting/slider to let the card ""pretend"" to have more vram; so i was hoping there is a slider somewhere in arccontrol or graphics command center but i have not found one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"many thanks, i was naively thinking the arc gpu can just pull ram from the system ram for vram.","i managed to edit a few projects on a xps 9520 with a 3050 which is also 4gb ram, but of course, the system pull 38gb of ram [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dellxps/comments/wc62h0/for_deciding_how_much_ram_to_get_for_video/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

the best one you can afford.,you know what your budget is.,that will dictate the gpu you end up getting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ddr5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it'd be exceedingly helpful if you gave us a budget to work with, but with that said: there's an argument to go ddr4 (3200 cl 16 - oc'd to 3600 and/or lowered to cl 14) since the soonest you'd likely upgrade is 2 generations thus a new socket/motherboard and ddr5 standard beyond current speeds and/or lowered msrp.","i'd double down on ddr4 if the motherboard is much cheaper than the ddr5 sku, you're gaming past 1440p, don't play high fps shooters, and/or don't have professional needs that benefit from ddr5.",the money you'd save from not getting an equivalent ddr5 could net you a 12700 for example.,"&#x200b;

edit: typo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"honestly, even if i had the money to spend on fast ddr5 i would wait.","my argument for that is that:

1. currently, most games (yeah there are exceptions) don't benefit from ddr5 currently.","if you do something that's memory intensive, then yeah, that's a bit different but those are kind of specific use cases.","2. as people have said, the cost of ddr5 is only going to go down so why spend money on it now if you don't benefit from it?","3. lastly, faster ddr5 is going to come out in the future -- just look at how ddr4 evolved over time.","by the time you need to upgrade, the ddr5 that you bought today will be ""slow"" by comparison so you might as well buy new (faster) ddr5 then.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i decided to go ddr5.,i wanna keep my 12700k for a long time and upgrading ram once faster and cheaper kits are available should be easy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"unless you are budget constrained or reusing existing ddr4, go for fast ddr5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12600k is alder lake and not raptor lake.,12th gen cpus can benefit from actual fast ddr5 in some cases but you need to weigh the cost benefit analysis.,presumably since you bought a 12600k instead of higher you are somewhat cost conscious as opposed to best at all cost.,fast ddr5 is again an important point here.,you might seem people now commonly citing that spider-man benchmark from techspot for instance.,that was using ddr6400c36(34?,can't remember) which carries a premium even for ddr5 memory.,"don't expect the same results if you're just buying the cheapest ddr5 4800 available, which in itself is still more expensive than ddr4.","personally i don't feel ddr5 is worth considering, given both the memory and motherboard cost, until you are at least on a 12700k cpu wise and top end gpu (if gaming is the factor) and basically into the diminishing returns curve of the cpu and gpu side.","the cost difference would be greater than say going from a 12600k->12700k or a gpu tier, so you'd need to look at it from the perspective of what actually gains you more.",i don't even think expensive highspeed ddr4 should be a strong consideration either barring some specialty cases either unless you meet the above.,this is however still based on current prices.,memory is facing strong downward pressure and the scenario might change even by the end of this year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ddr5 already improves some games like spider-man on pc especially concerning rt performance according to hardware unboxed.,iâ€™d definitely go with ddr5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"depends on how bad ddr5 prices are where you live, you can get some performance increase from ddr5 but that doesn't matter if the price is double.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ddr5 would be the way to go, friend.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you get ddr5 now, you will be able to delay replacing the ram when you upgrade to the next platform.","also, ddr5 will be a lot easier to sell on if you decide to upgrade the ram itself (to faster or higher capacity).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

using my brother's rig for reference (e.g.","9700k + 2080ti), i don't feel like i am missing out (that much) if i went with ddr4 to go with a 13700k setup.",the extra savings can be used for other things as well.......like buying food or using the cash to  purchase the elgato streamdeck xl controller,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you ain't upgrading in next 4 years, go ddr4.","just look back at ddr4 2333 today, yes it is usable, but no you won't want to use it when you upgrade your cpu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
best answer in this thread imo.,"but i still want to add that, i find it interesting that no one even asked ""how much ram do you need/want?""",because if you're targeting 64gb or 128gb (obviously not mainstream i know) the cost difference today would be far more obvious than if you're buying 16gb (which i don't think is a good idea these days) or 32gb kits (which the price in ddr5 could get you 64gb in ddr4 right now).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ddr5, presently, is in its *early* phase.","for the same price of 32gb kits today, who knows if within the next 2 years you could get faster latency ddr5-6400 or even ddr5-7000 64gb kits.",that's not even counting the influence of the higher capacity dimms that are going to come (at least 64gb per dimm for the consumer side).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i  also bought 12600 cpu intel  with ddr 5 kit 16 gb  next year when prices goes down i will buy  another 16 gb stick,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i mean, most people *are* budget constrained, and baseline ddr5 is still almost twice as expensive as baseline ddr4.",it has a while to go yet before itâ€™s the clear best choice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"spider-man was also a console port and had poor performance running on rdna 2 gpus, which is odd considering consoles literally use rdna.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was against it but the hardware unboxed video show some major gain in spider-man.,unless of course you already have ddr4 memory.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i see this brought up but i feel people should keep in mind that even the fast ddr5 on market currently will be considered relatively slow and low quality basically as ddr5 in general matures.,"and that fast ddr5 carries a large premium even for ddr5 that will likely drop fast as well, as in you can potentially buy it at half the price 1 year from now.",so the futureproofing angle is not as clear cut as it might seem.,"buying the cheaper ""slow"" ddr5 now would the basically akin to carrying forward something like ddr4 2400/2666 through ddr4's life span.","buying expensive ddr5 would be something like carrying forward ddr4 3000/3200, which is considered normal speeds now, but paying several times the price.","even in terms of resell if you've hypothetically been carrying forward those early ddr4 kits (akin to the ddr5 kits now) they aren't really carrying that much value either, certainly not to the level that you'd have paid for them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if everyone was that budget constrained, products like the 12900ks and 3090ti wouldnâ€™t exist!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the game is cpu and ram limited because the asset streaming and decompression is done on the cpu instead of the dedicated chip in the consoles.,also the constant moving of stuff from ram to vram adds lots of issues while the ps5 version uses the same ram for both cpu and gpu.,its the one game where even pcie gen 4 vs gen 3 gave another performance boost.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my reasoning is that getting rid of ddr4 in a couple years will be significantly less financially useful, and you'd have to change the ram anyway when upgrading to a new platform.","on the other hand, if you get ddr5 now, then you will have compatible ram on hand for whatever you want to build in the future or as spares for troubleshooting.","sure, not the best performing ram, but at least usable ram.",or you could sell it.,"not at a great price, but better than ddr4.","i'm not saying must buy ddr5, just saying that there are more pros that should be considered.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">most

and those two products are enthusiast with money to burn type stuff.",i recently built out a system with ddr4 and a 12700k and saved a heap of money for a slight performance dip on the ram.,"before i did that, i spent a lot of time reading to answer the question: is ddr5 worth it at the moment?","and the answer again and again was no, which was what i expected.",budget constraints matter for most people.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, yeah, if you can buy a 3090 ti, value doesnâ€™t matter at that point, just pimp everything out, but for most people it does.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok well you have a point.,"if you're already buying awful value parts, then you definitely want ddr5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i didn't say that you said you must buy ddr5.,i'm just posting other considerations if people are looking at the future proofing angle.,the problem is given the price difference and quality of ddr5 now versus a few years later you run into a situation in that buying ddr4 now and even throwing it away to buy ddr5 years later could actually still be cheaper and also resulting a faster experience then compared to buying ddr5 now.,this is a general caveat with the future proofing strategy especially if it's entirely predicated based on future need as technology in general is highly deflationary especially during the early lifespan.,the premise that you might be saving money in the long run basically is not as clear cut as it might seem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
getting rid of bad ddr5 will also be the same.,more so in fact as people wonâ€™t be warning to purchase bad ram in a few years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
^ the last two sentences are quote-worthy.,experienced this some years ago being in the market for ddr3 well into the ddr4 era.,ddr3-1600+ 8gb sticks (as 16gb/32gb kits) kept their prices so well they were basically almost the same price as new.,"granted this was when ram prices went hiking, and there's also the usual production phase-out that makes the older standard rarer on the market.","combined with *lifetime warranty*, if you keep your original packagings and receipts well, you might be surprised by how much value you can get from a higher-end parts from a well known brand, even if a gen older.","whereas ddr3-1066, or ddr4-2333 are the types usually sold by the lot.",ddr5-4800/5200... you get the idea.,those expecting to re-sell 2x8gb ddr5 sticks for close to their original prices later are in even worse delusions since we're expecting capacity per dimm to increase drastically with ddr5.,"i'd assume 512gb would be for servers, but 128/256gb are very likely, and 64gb per dimm is the obvious next.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
overheating immediately would indicate bad mounting (did you take the plastic off the plate?),or a non-functional cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
prolly he didn't attach pump power connector.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s impossible to have insight on you possibly installing your cpu wrong if you donâ€™t have any inclination,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"letâ€™s start with doing some undervolting and stop letting your motherboard use as much voltage as it wants, do 5.2 on the p core, and 41-42 on the e core and start at 1.3v and run a few cpu stress tests and increase the voltage by 0.05v until you are fully stable, like cinebench, you will get lower temps and better performance, thank me later",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m pretty sure that i fixed the problem.,one of the cables wasnâ€™t plugged all the way into the fan hub.,my pc is on right now and the cpu temp is staying between 22 and 27 degrees.,it says my cpu fan speed is 2300 rpm.,but it says my pump fan speed is 0rpm.,is this normal?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"also, should i be worried that i damaged my cpu?",in the bios it showed my cpu was at 90 degrees,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

bro you donâ€™t have icue control software to control fan speeds/curves and read pump speeds?,ofc that thing gonna overheat no fan curve.,you also need to set pump speed to extreme in icue.,or rather you should.,iâ€™m betting your bios has multi-core enhancement on by default.,"turn off mce, read up on how to overclock/undervolt this thing specific for your bios youâ€™ve got a few days of reading/experimenting ahead of you.","youâ€™ll need torture tests like prime95, occt, asus realbench monitoring software like hwinfo64 and definitely go download icue, the corsair control suite for your aio.","if youâ€™re certain it was fine before the aio, then all you should need is corsair icue or to repaste the aio with new paste after cleaning off the old paste with iso alcohol.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i would choose igpu in the future.,i had a situation recently where my bios reset and the system wouldn't boot with my pcie riser cable.,case is a mini itx sandwich layout so i couldn't just plug the card in to boot.,it was a huge pain in the ass just to save a few bucks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i've always bought cpus with igpu, but never actually needed it.",still i think it doesn't hurt to have such a backup.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"before my 12900k, iâ€™ve never actually owned a cpu with an igpu (other than laptops).",mostly because i stuck to hedt platforms and am otherwise just so freaking old i predate igpus.,"having it is convenient, especially for the minimal amount it costs (which, yes, is more significant for the 12100 or 12400, but at the price of a k-series cpu itâ€™s minimal).","benefits (assuming motherboard supports them):

- easy troubleshooting and backup if your gpu fails - and i had one fail on a hedt desktop last october, and because i didnâ€™t have an igpu, my troubleshooting process to figure out what was wrong ended up killing a pcie slot on another motherboard due to the bad gpu
- access to qsv encoders
- can hook up more monitors than your dgpu allows
- can choose which gpu to use to render any application like on a laptop (perhaps handy for incompatibilities or performance)

anyhow, if youâ€™re a power user you know what you need or donâ€™t need and can freely suffer the consequences if you pick wrong.","but for the average user, having the igpu even if only for troubleshooting purposes is worth it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the ability to debug is one thing, but the best thing an igpu let's you do is down the road when you upgrade, you can use it for a server or basic office pc, without needing to pair it with another dgpu.",i used to have a 2500k that i turned into my plex server once i upgraded to a 6700k.,that 6700k will go into the plex server once i upgrade again.,the 2500k is still good for use for someone as an office/light browsing machine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not useful until your pcie slot or gpu brokes and need to do stuff urgently,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wow almost perfect bell curve,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have never actually used an igpu for troubleshooting a dgpu, although i really like having them for low power systems.",alder lake + igpu is stupidly low power at idle.,it's usually pretty easy to figure out if a dgpu is dead.,"put it in a second pcie slot or a second computer and you pretty much know if it's working or not, even without the igpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s mostly unnecessary.,it can be helpful if you plan to repurpose it though.,i tend to use old cpus for home file server or firewall.,"when a dgpu isnâ€™t working, itâ€™s easier to test in another system.","changing slots may work but if the pcie slots fail on the motherboard, it doesnâ€™t prove the gpu is dead.",i worked on a system once that had all the slots fail on the motherboard after an hour.,itâ€™s only happened one time but still weird.,the igpu can also be useful for quick sync for video encoding if you start streaming etc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i've had a pcie slot (or at least something related to it, but the computer fairly old to begin with, was using it at the time because my main pc's motherboard died on me) die on me just once, i've also accidentally killed my gpu once, this is in roughly about a 7 year period, so not all that common, at least for me.","if you have an extra gpu or don't mind buying a spare if something were to happen then going without an igpu should be fine, although the hardware encoding can be nice to have.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm never buying an f again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i will admit i only ever had a graphics card die on me once - and it was really old at the time (it was in my sons old computer which was like his first computer that i built with mostly old parts from mine).,good thing that my 4790k i was using in mine at the time had on board graphics so i could still use it until i could order a new gpu.,i think i gave him my old 760 (which wasn't super old back then) to use until i ordered him a new one since i didn't game much at all back then.,now i game more than i did then but not a ton.,my asus rtx 3050 is more than plenty for me.,i will always buy a processor with on board graphics in case it ever happens again.,cost difference is only a few bucks so worth the extra 15-20 bucks or so for peace of mind.,"i might go up to like a 13700 or 13400, etc.",when 13th gen comes out but non f with graphics just in case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for me it's absolutely unnecessary as i keep an older gpu laying around, if my current gpu died (rtx 3080) and it's being rma'ed for over a week to a month then having my backup gtx 1070 is important, no igpu is going to be able to run 1440p games at half decent settings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in all my build i will always have an igpu present.,just the other dy i was able to remedy my mother's pc.,my dad was ready to chuck out the gpu when it was a faulty ram module.,the igpu booted up with both ram sticks but when i went back to the dgpu it would either lock up or no source which lead me to the ram.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's nice to have, but not necessary.","a lot of computers pre-2010 didn't have an igp, and the world didn't explode then.","if you don't have an old graphics card in your troubleshooting kit, you can get something cheap and old like a gt 610 for like 10 bucks on the used market.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
given the minor price difference  i would always choose the igpu.,"while i have never needed to use it for catatastrophic troubleshooting where the dgpu failed entirely, i have used it a ton for other reasons:

* testing system/boot before having to put the dgpu back in (accessing stuff like nvmes or changing the cooler is just so much simpler without a giant dgpu in the way).","* 2nd life without dgpu
* i have a monitor (dell u3223qe), which will not properly work with hdr on any nvidia dgpu, but does so on intel igpu (also at launch it remained completely black on nvidia dgpus.",but that was fixed after a few months with an nvidia driver update).,so i am currently running hybrid gpus with that monitor attached to the igpu.,otherwise i would have had to not use hdr and initially get a different device in order to access the osd and change the settings that caused the monitor to black-screen on nvidia gpus.,* also depending on your dgpu the igpu with hybrid graphics can be used to save a lot of power.,"on desktop the uhd 770 can run most multi-monitor setups (hdr might bring it to its limits) at under 1w of additional power, while a beefy dgpu like a rtx 3090 can suck up many more watts for multi-monitor setups, especially with high refresh rates.","windows can use the dgpu for processing if needed, just like most notebooks can.","this did not work stutter free for me however, due to use of hdr, but would have saved about 40ws for my 3 monitor-setup when idling on the desktop.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if it's linux, i'd definitely go with the igpu since it would make certain thing involving virtual machines easier.","if it's a mid-to-high-end build, the igpu is usually on a small percentage of the overall price.",the f models are best in the ultra low budget quad-core gaming builds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just have old ass gpus lying around for troubleshooting.,if you donâ€™t then yeah igpu would be nice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">i'd even take just the 8 p-cores alone

i wish they released a high end cpu with just p-cores.",i tend to test games with ht off to see if there's a difference and what i noticed with most games is if you turn off hyper threading the frametime is usually flatter (even if by little) and the fps holds higher and is more consistent.,i'd kill to have 10-12 core pure performance cores cpu with a high ring bus and a shit ton of cache.,i own both a 9900k and a 9700k.one with ht and one is pure performance cores.the 9700k is noticely smoother in alot of cases because ht is just another variable that can cause inconsistency in frametime/performance because its obviously not a full core.,"(with a couple of exceptions i can count on 1 hand like apex where the 9900k had less micro stutters)

pentium ii and pentium iii both had the same p6 base architecture but there were a lot of changes that enabled intel to clock pentium iii significantly higher.,in the end it was literally a 300% performance improvement over pentium ii due to clocks alone.,those were the days.,of course the slowest pentium iii was almost the same as the fastest pentium ii (it actually was slightly faster even though the specs look the same).,however pentium iii introduced sse instructions and some other extra features over pentium ii.,i would say it makes sense to update the brand name when there is a very significant performance increase coming.,"p6 was a good flexible design, this was the architecture that brought out of order and speculative execution of micro operations into mainstream.",netburst was a significantly different design in many ways but core returned to basically iterating over p6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the pentium (p5) was followed by the pentium pro (p6)  

the pentium pro was a multi chip module with a separate l2 cache chip that ran at the same speed as the cpu.",this was expensive because it couldn't be tested until fully assembled so they had to throw away a lot of them.,even more important was that the pentium pro  wasn't much faster if you still ran 16-bit dos/windows code.,"when it was originally architected years earlier, intel assumed that people would be running 32-bit code by then but that wasn't the case.","more info:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pentium_pro#performance

intel got to work on the pentium ii which fixed both of these issues.",it used a cheaper pcb instead of the expensive multi chip module and called it slot 1.  it also used cheaper (and often more) l2 cache that ran at half the speed of the cpu.,i believe intel fabricated the pentium pro l2 cache die but the pentium ii l2 cache chips were from a variety of different vendors.,"> 
> intel improved 16-bit code execution performance on the pentium ii, an area in which the pentium pro was at a notable handicap, by adding segment register caches.","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pentium_ii#overview

why did intel use the name pentium ii?",well it was a new architecture over the original pentium and the pentium pro was marketed towards workstation users that would be running 32-bit code in windows nt not the 16-bit dos/win95.,someone else already explained the pentium !,!!,name.,"yeah, intel was using 3 exclamation points in a lot of marketing back then.",i remember a lot of magazines criticizing the pentium iii for not being a new architecture and not worthy of bumping up the version number.,"when mmx instructions were added it was just the pentium mmx, they didn't add a number.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"check ""what makes a ""new"" cpu new?""",in red hill cpu guide (which should be... 20 years old?,"), there is even a mention about the original pentium 3 katmai being almost just a pentium 2 deschutes with sse instructions and arguing than it should have been part of the pentium 2 family: https://www.redhill.net.au/c/c-d.php

"to start, the pentium ii brought the features behind the pentium pro (p6 architecture and ""on-cpu"" l2 cache) for the mainstream market at a relatively affordable price-point.","the pentium iii, on the other hand, added the sse instruction set that later became the basis for intel's future extensions, like the obvious sse2-4 and even avx extensions (if i'm not mistaken).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
small aside - and not the reason the names were chosen but the two times intel had significant clock speed regressions on the desktop (but large increases in ipc) they introduced new branding names (that weren't numbers).,the original pentium hit 66 mhz on the same process that intels 486 hit 100 mhz.,the pentium was a lot faster especially on floating point code.,"the core 2 (core ""1"" was for mobile) also significantly increased overall performance but clocked about 1 ghz less than old pentium 4 and d.  

...

others have covered the early pentium naming well but yeah it was some branding to show off similar enhancements from each chip.","pentium, pentium mmx, pentium pro, pentium ii, iii, and 4 all represented some major changes... though ii and iii were closest in design initially vs any other combo.","also there was supposed to be a pentium 5 - either the prescott based pentium 4 which was a major change in architecture (55% longer pipeline, 64 bit) or the successor tejas... but it didn't happen because tejas was canned for reasons and pentium 4 prescott didn't substantially increase performance over pentium 4 northwood.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"say, did the first pentium iii's clock its l2 cache at 100% cpu speed, or at half like the earlier pentium ii's?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">the pentium ii brought the features behind the pentium pro (p6 architecture and ""on-cpu"" l2 cache) 

pentium 3 brought the on cpu l2 cache.",pentium 2 used external sram chips similar to the pentium pro.,">the pentium iii, on the other hand, added the sse instruction set that later became the basis for intel's future extensions, like the obvious sse2-4 and even avx extensions (if i'm not mistaken).","yes, they're actually still used to this day as they were subsumed into avx.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

iâ€™m using a 12700k and a rtx 3070 undervolted.,power consumption while gaming is between 150-280 depending on the game.,at stock iâ€™d imagine they would pull 400 at the absolute maximum while playing games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're on the bubble.,"nvidia recommends a minimum system psu of 650w for use with the 3070. so, you have that, and being gold rated it won't be crap, but the 12700k is also not a svelte cpu when it comes to power draw.","so...

1) you can try it.","2) depending on how old the psu is, and if there's any warranty left, i would personally want to upgrade to at least 850w.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"so, i haven't followed the 5000(amd)/12000 series too closely, but from what i gather with zen 4 is that 12000 series even possibly match zen4 7000 series non 3d.",keep in mind raptor lake (13000) is rumored to have a 60% lift in performance but they are not making any ipc changes so while i dont expect that lift we should still see better performance.,raptor should be announced here really soon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you're looking for a 11900k, why not look for the 11700k?",and you have to remember that this is before intel reduced their lithography so those cpus are going to consume power like it's nothing.,"please do yourself a favor: if the 11900k/11700k is +/-5% within a 12600k, get the 12600k and never look back.","or wait until 13th gen, which is what i would personally recommend.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you should check if this task is cache sensitive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fair -- then i'd definitely recommend waiting like 5-6 weeks and see what 13th gen has to offer if  you want to stay with intel.,"13th gen brings cache and clock increases that should make it even more of a beast for gaming than 12th gen.  

fwiw i've been overclocking since the 80486 era (i.e.",early 1990s) - where you had to solder in new oscillators to make chips run at different speeds.,i agree ram tweaking is generally where it's at these days for games;  cpus are starting to get less interesting for oc because they're running so close to the limit out of the box in most cases.,keep an eye on something like i7-13700/f (no-k) and see how that compares performance wise vs. 13600k and 12700k/13700k - you might be surprised that just setting it to an unlimited power budget with good cooling (like you has) while tweaking ram gets you vs chasing 100-200 mhz more on the i7..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well the cache in cpu is like ram that is in the inside the cpu that it can access and store data immediately instead of having to have the data travel in between the distance from the cpu and ram on the motherboard so the more cache the better performance and also the e-cores handle the background tasks and minor applications like discord and msi afterburner so the more e-cores you have the more your p-cores can focus on running the game so again that equals more performance and all around greater gaming experience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i donâ€™t think theyâ€™ll be able to do an ipc increase, theyâ€™re using the same node as 12th gen. now that may sound like they canâ€™t innovate but remember how efficient amd was on 7nm and how they didnâ€™t upgrade nodes from ryzen 3000 and rx 5000 to ryzen 5000 and rx 6000?.","14th gen intel, when they move nodes and use both tsmc and their own nodes will be interesting.","also, i think in a few years, if intel gpus donâ€™t fall through, amd intel and nvidia will all use tsmc 3nm for their gpus.",maybe that will change but thatâ€™ll be really cool,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, well, i've noticed that the ability to keep the boost up indefinitely would essentially defeat the need for user-done overclocking.",the only problem would be to convince the games that they need it.,"if you had some sort of 'always turbo' tick box in game settings, you wouldn't need a k cpu or z mobo.",the money saved could indeed go into faster ram.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i hope you looked at gaming benchmarks because the 5800x3d is currently the best gaming cpu.,beating the 12900k/12700k while being significant cheaper.,but because of the reduced clockspeed it is not the best in other applications.,just gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah, it's better not to be a beta tester for games, mobos, bioses and the os, and if you also want to avoid the novelty tax, you just incorporate 2 or 3 years' delay into your cycle, and suddenly things become so much more reasonable.","everything has been tested and fixed and works like a solid release should, plus you get it much cheaper, at least as long you don't run into problems with second-hand hardware.","re: ddr5, of course i would like it, especially 5600 or up, but not at the price it costs now plus the added cost of a ddr5-compatible mobo.","even if i decided to buy new sticks, a faster pair of ddr4 would probably still be more reasonable to buy.","and i might, because while existing pair have an impressive cl14 for 3000, the frequency matters more these days and 3000 is kinda slow these days and won't be overclocked by much on my mobo for some reason (it seems to dislike the simultaneous overclocking of cpu and ram), plus i'm too much of a lazy n00b to figure out the timings if any misstep can cost me a windows reinstall in 11 (unlike 10, which was more resilient).","right now, >4000mhz ddr4 can be purchased for half the price of the cheapest reasonable ddr5, so no deal.","on the other hand, ddr5 will have to go down soon anyway, perhaps give it a year if amd truly ditches ddr4 with ryzen 7000 and perhaps intel follows suit with 14th gen. for ddr5 to have mass appeal, to be viable as the default ram standard, the markup shenanigans will have to end.",so it would probably be a poor decision to buy fast ddr4 right now.,"and might be a poor decision to buy a ddr4 mobo, consequently.","but my 9600kf is a poor overclocker and benches below average in benchmarks, so it won't last me for long.",it's already a bottleneck right now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's likely as isn't oc.,modern intel cpus have a base clock which is the minimum they'll typically run at under load and then a series of boost speeds that enable the cpu to run at a higher frequency if less cores are loaded.,your cpu caps out at 5ghz for lightly/single threaded operations (but in practice likely will hit 4.9ghz).,"turbo features are not harmful, i've used them for years and they've been rock solid stable the whole time, my last 3 cpus are all still functional and all had these features enabled by default.",is there a problem you're having with the pc or were you just concerned by a higher than expected clock?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's the intel turbo-boost as other comments say.,"the bios may have an option to ""disable turbo"" which sometimes works.",also if you [set your cpu power maximum capacity to 99%](https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/use-maximum-cpu-power-windows-10) in the power plan it won't boost but running many games will override the power profile and enable the turbo boost for some reason.,99% is also slightly lower than the processor's labelled clock speed.,since i do a lot of 100% cpu utilization for hours (e.g.,rendering or encoding) i like to disable the turbo because i have a crappy fan.,"however, to be fair, my i5 has maxed out at 100 f multiple times at which point the hardware will force slow it down (intended function) and my computer still works great.",i ran an intel laptop i3 at 95 degrees 8 hours a day for \~8 years with no problems as well except for low level burn bruising on my thigh so most people on forums seem to overestimate how sensitive modern cpus are to heat.,"truly, intel processors are rated for operation at 100 f max, so if you're turbo boosting and not getting past 90 f don't even worry about disabling it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"why would you want to underclock it 


and even why would you overclock it 

this cpu is a beast",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to my knowledge, you can't.",not the k range,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
isn't the 12700k turbo 5ghz though?,my 9700k on turbo is 4.9ghz and always displays as such in task manager.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i don't know, because you have paid a premium for having the ""k"" version, over the regular 12700 chip.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"whatâ€™s you mean by, gimp?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you could download the intel extreme tuning application and turn your max boost time down if you are throttling etc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've wondered about this as well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what if windows limited one cltr+z that would take you back 1hz at a time?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"lol, that would actually be awesome tho, would make ocing a lot better",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's because of morons like you i was too afraid to raise my hand and ask questions in school,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's exactly why people don't asks questions.,because of people like you making fun of them.,you were born with all this knowledge i suppose?,we all were beginners at some point and that includes you.,no need to be an ass to them to make you feel better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
too bad rather than sharing knowledge you opted to belittle them.,it's always ok to ask a question it would have taken you only another 10 seconds to answer the question assuming you know the correct answer of course.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"he's at 100% load, so he'd get the all core turbo which is a max of 4.7 ghz.","i'm not sure  why task manager is showing 200 mhz less, but it's a little wonky with how it handles reporting boost and efficiency core clocks so that is probably normal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yea, i mean it's not like intel has a very easy to find comprehensive database of every cpu they've made with the parameters of normal operation listed for each.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or people could look at the product description when they are spending hundreds of dollars on something or do a 1 second google search that would lead them to ark and tell them what the turbo speed is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
neither is the op.,think before you speak.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is the answer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you sir,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
^ this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so the guy asked here instead of searching a database that he probably didn't know existed, what's the big deal?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel doesnâ€™t list the per core or all core turbo on ark anymore, only the max single core.",itâ€™s no wonder people get confused when intel themselves obfuscate the normal operating frequencies of the cpu.,stuff like pl1 pl2 tau is not well documented or understood by the average user.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes some people could be a bit more thorough with their search for info.,my point is that you don't need to call someone a moron if you feel like he's not deserving of your time.,"basically, you don't want to help?",move along.,if you put the time to write a reply and it's an insult then you are just rude.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
never said it was?,op thinks their cpu is overclocked because they can't be bothered to read anything about the products they buy.,"what you suggested also has nothing to do with overclocking, so i'm not sure why you would think to suggest it here considering op thought their cpu was overclocked...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"of course, as a space heater for an apartmentblock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

an i3 10105 or 11400 yeah thatâ€™s good for the board

but with a high end processor like that yeah i would do better with a newer and higher end board",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think you need z590 mobo for full cpu potential.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
congrats on the free i9.,"the vrms on your board aren't ideal, so consider selling them both and get: 

1) one of the big noctua/sycthe hsfs with lga1700 and am5 compatibility.",they should also offer you mounting upgrade kits for lga18xx later.,2) a board with the best vrms within your budget (e.g.,"msi b560m mortar), maybe used with warranty.",i wanted to throw in psu there but you should watch for atx 3.0 ones to come in first if you care about longevity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it will work but you wonâ€™t get full performance.,does that matter to you?,even so you will get a bump from this upgrade as is.,i would get a good cooler.,i bought a noctua air cooler after having a 240 aio first.,the aio wasnâ€™t enough for it and it had some pump issues after a month.,"the noctua raised my scores in passmark, geekbench and phoronix test suite.",on my system itâ€™s still a little flaky trying to enable the newer boost features on an asus prime mb.,so donâ€™t expect miracles with a modest motherboard.,it also loves fast ram.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sell everything and get a 12700f b660 build.,even with the stock cooler itâ€™s plenty fast but an aftermarket cooler is recommended,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"he'll probably see some throttling in heavy multithreaded loads, but gaming should be mostly fine.",the 11900k doesn't turn into a 350w monster until you fire up prime95 with an overclock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have the 11400f with the same board and was just about to purchase the i9 to do the upgrade how bad do you think the performance would drop,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am going to get a new cooler but i will within the next few weeks get a new motherboard but for rn i just wanna know if it will work or will it fry things  and i got 16gb 3600mhz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in gaming it's not so bad but worst case is nearly 50% down.,"https://www.techspot.com/article/2252-intel-b560-disaster/

also check your bios for power limits.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3600 is fine.,"i wouldn't run the cpu with an inadequate cooler, but as long as the cpu is listed as ""supported"" on the motherboard cpu list, it should be fine.",don't try to overclock on that motherboard or go crazy with turbo settings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok so basically just drop it in as is and over lock until i get a new mother board,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah but donâ€™t use the stock cooler from your old cpu as that canâ€™t handle an 11900k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no iâ€™m getting a 360 aio,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

did you have any trouble with the bracket?,i have constant crashes and i think it is because of the flex on the cpu bracket.,thinking about getting a 3rd party bracket to see if it fixes it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seems fine to me.,probably there is power limit in the bios.,they can draw like 180watt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"150 w for 1.25 v in r23 sound way too little, download hwinfo and check there.","but for the given power draw, temperatures seem on spot.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"till you can figure out a fix, you could always get a $15 usb wifi dongle on amazon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s possible that the internal wifi card is overheating or was damaged over time.,some laptop manufacturers put them near a hot component and heat from the cpu or gpu will run over them.,you might be able to get a new adapter for it on amazon and even upgrade to wifi 6 802.11ax.,depending on brand it might be locked to specific chips or brands of m.2 wifi though.,"if you donâ€™t feel comfortable opening up the laptop, just buy a usb dongle on amazon.",one warning is there are two types of hookups for these.,some cards can work with both.,they often have pictures in the listing and you can compare with what you have.,you can usually find videos on youtube on how to open the laptop.,"if itâ€™s still under warranty, you might be able to get the laptop manufacturer to replace it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ive done that and now with cinebench it just goes down to 4.7ghz p-cores and 3.7 e-cores.,consuming 250w.,"-0.050v offset

"going from your replies, i think there are two important things here: 

1) you're not experienced in installing/reinstalling cpus.","in which case, you'll either need someone to do it for you, or you'll have to gain the experience yourself by trial and error.","2) on top of that, unfortunately there is a widely known issue with lga1700 ilms (independent loading mechanism) that's causing your cpu's ihs to get ""bent"" and therefore uneven pressure --> uneven contact between heatsink and your cpu --> higher temps -- which you seem to be not aware of.","for reference, watch [this video](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000088402/processors.html), see the latch on the one side?",that's what's causing the uneven pressure.,"there are 3rd party contact frames that are made to solve this issue, like the one u/falcitone mentioned.",you'll have to disassemble the original ilm and then install the contact frame like on [this video by gn](https://youtu.be/iyu1oskby-q?t=894).,there's also a previous video by them with the thermal grizzly version.,"so after watching these vids (plus the how-tos on removing & installing the noctua hsf), decide for yourself whether you're going to try all this by yourself or at least have an experienced tech person/friend watching what you're doing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that's almost impossible to answer except with mass participation in gathering data from when their system was built to a certain point of time later (e.g.,6-12 months).,"but what i'm seeing is that most of those reporting temperature problems have the k variants, which makes sense since the typical tdp is at least 150w for the 12600k, which is more than twice the non-k's (65w), so *if* there's uneven contact it will be apparent much more quickly.","the non-k variants, esp the lower core-count 12600 and lower will probably not see temps as an issue at least until much later.","btw, i should've mentioned that replacing the original ilm will void the warranty, so if you choose to replace it with one of the alternative contact frames, and *if* something happens with your board and you want to rma it, you'll have to reattach the original ilm before sending it in.",otherwise you can just remount the heatsink and monitor the temps for another 6 months.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"> i used hwinfo to test my latency, and it's reading at 19-19-19-43.

those numbers are meaningless unless without also including the frequency, however 2666 @ cl19 does end up being *slightly* worse latency-wise than 2400 @ cl16, 2666 equivalent of 2400 @ cl16 is 2666 @ cl18.","overall, there's not a huge difference and, if your laptop has a halfway decent bios you *might* be able to change those subtimings, but even if you can't, it won't be a huge difference.",> why is the 2400 mhz cl16 advertising better speed than the one i have running at 2666?,could it be because my current ram is only a single channel 8gb and the 2400 mhz is dual channel 16gb?,would the cl16 2400 mhz actually be faster than my current single channel cl16 2666?,what do you mean better speed?,bandwidth?,"if so and it's a dual channel kit, that would make sense since dual channel offers about double the bandwidth.","also, is the ram that's in it soldered in?","(i ask since the majority of laptops for the last 5+ years have mostly had ram soldered to the motherboard) if it is, try to get a second stick with the same frequency /subtimings, if they're different the frequency drops to the lower of the two sticks (not too sure about subtimings, though).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dual channel always beats single channel.,it very literally doubles the available bandwidth for a given datarate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
firstly what you have is a 2666 cl19 stick as hwinfo says.,(first number in the 4 number sequence).,honestly i dont think you will see a big difference either way but a 2400cl16 will beat your current 2666cl19.,if you wanna save some money just but another 8gb 2666cl19 as the difference will be very little,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"simple answers

q1) 2400 mhz does show lower latency, but thats just how it works.",lower frequency the easier it is to have lower latency.,this does not automatically mean its better.,q2) dual channel (2 sticks) ram always beats a single channel (1stick)  of ram.,2400 at c16 is almost same as 2666 at c19.,frequency and latency make them almost equal.,"in conclusion, if yoy laptop can support 2 sticks or ram, then get it.",2400 c16 is good enough,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"keep in mind that latency is specified in clocks, meaning the latency differs depending on the frequency.","2400 cl16 = 1/1.2 * 16 = 13.3 ns

2666 cl16 = 1/1.33 * 16 = 12 ns

2666 cl18 = 1/1.33 * 18 = 13.5 ns

2666 cl19 = 14.3 ns

so 2400 cl16 has a slightly higher latency than 2666 cl16, and itâ€™s closer to 2666 cl18.",but i would always go with dual channel because itâ€™s doubling your bandwidth (and in this case youâ€™re also doubling your memory capacity).,"even if you go with a slightly lower speed grade, the dual channel kit is the clear winner.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dual channel will always be faster.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
first of all you have a cl19 @2666 mhz stick right now.,i think the difference between that and cl16 @2400 mhz will not be noticable.,"secondly, there is no such thing as a single channel or dual channel stick.","the stick doesn't change, it just matters if you have one or two sticks and if the motherboard supports it.","i think all laptop motherboards support dual channel, so you can just add a second stick.","the only thing is that in dual channel you have to run both sticks at the same frequency and timings, so it makes sense to buy another stick with cl19 @2666 mhz.","you could also buy a stick that is slower or higher, but you will need to run them at the sort of timings and frequency that both support.",so if you would buy a 2400 mhz stick than you have to run both at 2400 mhz.,btw.,"do not forgot to change the frequency in the bios, because otherwise everything will run on the standard 2133 mhz.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
always aim for dual channel.,latency on both will be negligible and wonâ€™t even show up in benchmarks or real life use because the dual channel is just way faster.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

agreed.,"what i ment is, when the frequency is lower, latency also generally is lower.",thats all.,i gave a simple answer to my man as he clearly does not understand how memory works.,edit: yes you can just look at frequency and cl timings alone and make a pretty accurate judgement.,unless we take into consideration of memory density,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you should definitely go into your bios and check.,you probably need to activate their xmp profile.,you can do both at the same time.,is it a new ssd or are you switching out the old one?,if you switch out the old one remember that you will need to install windows on it.,"also if you put in a new ssd or hdd, you will need to partition it, it won't work out of the box.",you can google how to do it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

they are generally equal especially in gaming.,tho 3600 c16 usually wins in production workloads.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you install windows on your ssd then you will need to partition it during the installation.,"for example, you can only make one partition out of it.",(the main one usually called system c).,you can also make 2 or more partitions and choose how big they should be.,you could also make another partition called data d. i usually just do one partition.,i think you still need to put in into the bios.,"if you don't have xmp, then you need to put in the frequency and timings manually.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, because it's b-die 3200 14-14-14 against cjr 3600 16-19-19.",3200 wins in absolutely every use.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so i'll do that as part of installing windows on the new ssd?,or do i need to go in and do that beforehand?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
okay now you are not comparing like to like.,"alright, o wise one, give me source for your information.",plus u do realise there is b-die for 3600 c16-16-16-36 right?,"in this case 3600 c""16"", will win",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it's *probably* using e-cores instead of p-cores in those games, you could manually set it to use the correct cores each time you start the game/install process lasso so it saves which cores to use, or just reinstall windows 11.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes to the first question no to benchmarks.,"another issue i noticed while watching hwmonitor for temps which were all good was even intensive games, i used elden ring to test on max settings were only using 20-50% of my gpu and 15% of my cpu and ran horribly.",my old rx 580 and 5th gen cpu ran it better lol.,"i did reinstall w11 already but have bad internet and could only test a small game ""valheim"" and that was utilizing more, more than it did on w10 as i played it on that os as well.","hit 100% gpu and it stayed around 35-40%, cpu.",it's not a very intensive game.,is there a specific program i should use for benchmarks?,i've never messed around with those.,thx,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, cpu benchmark is best with cinebench r23; at least there are a lot of comparisons available to know what range your score should be in.","also monitor cpu package power, because that combined with your temperatures can help determine how well your cooling is working.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my guess is that a company may setup a shell business in singapore as a gateway into china.,this is because hong kong used to be the gateway into china.,"but with hong kong becoming more like china and less like the west, i suspect a number of western business that were located in hong kong have relocated to singapore.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
singapore also has tons of data centers.,all the major cloud providers are there and ovh started expanding there relatively recently.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah and ppl keep telling singapore we're too small to make an impact on global scale.,it's mainly because of the growing data center demand likely and we got good infrastructure to have hundreds of thousands of servers across a few of the newer ones.,"amd and intel both do final diffusion in malaysia, which is right next door and they have insanely low cost to get shipped to singapore via land transport.","because of all that, it's far cheaper to logistically roll things out here.",think maybe 10x to 100x cheaper logistics cost per cpu to be sold to singapore than any other country on the planet.,"consider the war jacking up oil prices, profits elsewhere takes a huge nosedive downwards due to logistics costs.",hence i can see why singapore has become a major profit center for both intel and amd.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not just a gateway to china but the entire sea region.,most of the server locations in sea is located on singapore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
equipment costs already completely pale in comparison to the energy costs of a data centre.,when you're talking about the logistics cost being a little higher which is a small fraction of the equipment costs then the argument is frankly ridiculous.,it will be because of location more than anything.,i don't know if singapore is huge into tidal energy generation because the cheaper energy production/supply the better for server centres.,it's not great for solar afaik because it gets a lot of cloud iirc.,"but because of it's location i'd guess that singapore is a huge access point for undersea internet cables to the philippines, indonesia, australia, papau new guinea, new zealand and any/all smaller islands in the region.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
singapore has had a global impact long before all this.. not necessarily in the tech industry but you donâ€™t become that rich of a nation doing nothing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can ship a pallet of $10k each cpus to antarctica at a piece price of maybe $20 lol.,logistics cost of something so small and so valuable doesn't matter.,something larger like a server chassis makes a somewhat bigger difference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> it's mainly because of the growing data center demand likely and we got good infrastructure to have hundreds of thousands of servers across a few of the newer ones.,you would think that the small size of singapore would make it undesirable for server farms.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it is, and it also isn't.",singapore uses the latest tech.,then neighboring countries come to buy the ones that are replaced.,"so the sales for intel's latest are smaller in qty especially in indonesia, vietnam and malaysia in the past.",but then things are changing.,malaysia has begun consuming more of the latest tech.,so is vietnam.,especially during the crypto phase last 2 years.,so that 18% is mostly just consumption for our single nation.,i think singapore easily has the highest silicon density per capita on the planet.,"a typical household has about 1.5 mobile phones per person, 0.75 laptop and 0.35 desktops.","in the office it's replicated yet again with another 0.8 laptop, 0.5 desktops, 0.3 mobile phones per worker.","some families like mine, has a desktop per person and a laptop per person as well as 2 mobile phones per person.",we also upgrade on a shorter cycle than most other countries usually 2-3 years because there is demand pulling the older tech to surrounding countries.,i guess as a nation we're quite hungry for the latest tech.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
captain jack sparrow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and japan/west coast usa, china/russia, europe too.","we're building offshore solar stations now, tidal not yet.",we also have a new agreement with other asean countries to import solar power to feed the hungry data centers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it has something that is ironically helpful in current times, a stable climate, where the weather is hot and humid all year round.",causing all data center designed around cooling extreme heat and high humidity.,"in today's climate changed environment, where other data centers have gone down due to them being designed for a cooler climate e.g.",europe and america.,this also means the dense data centers designed in singapore are more likely to remain operational despite global temperatures rising.,"europe, america and china are quickly finding out that tropical data center designs may need to be transplanted quickly to their own data centers, or more outages will occur.","with undersea datacenters coming online around the world, singapore is also an island surrounded by ocean, making it even more attractive to build them here.",due to existing high tech and high quality infrastructure reducing the cost of setting these new advanced data centers by a lot to be honest.,about 40% of the earth's undersea fibre optic cables connect in singapore.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but *why* is singapore so hungry for latest tech?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its popularity doesn't have much to do with its climate imo.,"1. cables
2. location (latency)
3. politics are better than alternatives
4. access to educated work force
5. momentum; e.g.","aws, etc.","are there, so others naturally congregate.",honestly a lot of the dcs in sg are not great facilities.,source: deployed network to a lot of them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"> what will be the long term consequence of the high core count upon the ""older"" generation laptops/cpus

it'll heavily depend on what the person uses their pc for, i suspect for most people a 4c8t cpu is going to be more than enough for a very long time (although if it's an older cpu, its lack of newer hardware encoding can definitely become an issue if they want to watch, for example, 4k video, but throwing a gpu with newer hardware encoding can be a great ""bandaid"" in this type of situation), even 2c4t can be more than enough for a lot of people if all they ever do is browse the internet or run some not very demanding programs.","although laptops never last long because you can never upgrade them, the biggest issue here is you can't just install newer hardware decoding, that along with having to run the cpu at a lower frequency can definitely be an issue in the long run.",> casual use are we going to see them become sooner obsolete?,"for casual use, i don't see core count being an issue at all, unless they're on a >10 year old system (pre-sandy bridge), or if they need newer hardware encoding for watching videos, but that can be alleviated with a gpu that has newer hardware encoding, but that issue isn't core count related at all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for casual use like web browsing or email, even older dual cores are fine as long as they're paired with an ssd and a fresh install of windows.",for things like gaming or workstation type tasks yes i think we are already seeing older models fall off in relevance.,six cores with multithreading have been sort of the standard for affordable i5/r5 tier cpus for a couple generations now.,"cpus like the 12100 or even older models like the 7700 can still work, but there is going to be a performance penalty in most games for example.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm still rocking a lightweight dual core ultrabook and it's definitely showing its age vs. quad core and above.,"windows update and windows defender which can launch parallel threads for example can but saturate 100% of the cpu, during which time the laptop is almost unusable.",on a 4 core system they're limited to about 50% and it's not nearly as noticable.,i'm expecting i'm the next year or two that i'll need to upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

more cores is going to be the way things go for performance / gaming machines.,for general purpose machines i really think 4 cores is just fine.,"i mean, i bought a qx6700 - intelâ€™s first quad core (no ht) cpu - in late 2006 or early 2007. that was like 16 years ago.",that system is old enough to drive now.,the fact that 4-core cpus may soon no longer be mainstream desirable is just inevitable progression.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"one way i found to ""undervolt"" cpu's without actually touching the voltage is to stick an all core cpu ratio to the max all core boost of said cpu.","for example my 9900k all core boosts to 4.7ghz in anything ""heavy"" games/benchmarks but can go 5gz on single cores.",what i noticed is if i put a manual all core clock of 4.7ghz the bios gives significantly less voltage because it doesn't have to account for cores going 5ghz.,(you wouldn't want single cores to go to 5ghz anyway),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
take a look at  [msi undervolting guide](https://www.msi.com/blog/intel-core-i9-12900k-faq%e2%80%93cooler-overclocking-and-more),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, that's not undervolting.",you will lose a lot of performance by doing that.,"to be exactly 65-125w is the tdp of a 12700 non-k, so you might as well have bought the cheaper cpu in that case.","by setting an offset voltage to -0.1v, you can save a lot of power (a lot, since power draw goes squared with voltage), while retaining performance.","technically that's overclocking, so you will have to test for stability, but a 0.1v undervolt should be attainable by all 12700k's except the worst binned.","so, to actually answer the question of to: try setting offset voltage to -0.05v (50mv), then test prime95 for 5 minutes.","then go up to -0.075v, test, then go to -0.1v (100mv), and test prime95 for an hour or so for final check of stability.","if it's stable, leave it at that and enjoy your much cooler yet equally fast cpu.",you might even try -0.125. my own 12700k runs stable at -0.115v.,"only then, if it's still too hot, consider lowering tdp.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is the correct answer.,"undervolting reduces stability, it's better to power limit.",i have mine set at 85w pl1=pl2 and it's still beastly.,it also never goes over 60 deg on air.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"okay, yes, undervolting reduces power and heat while maintaining performance (to a certain point where stability and/or performance starts to suffer), while power limiting reduces power and heat while guaranteeing to sacrifice performanceâ€¦ but itâ€™s also highly effective at taming temperatures while not reducing performance proportionally.","like, cutting the pl2 in half will not result in half performance.",and the op did specify â€œunderclockingâ€.,"at any rate, i would agree to start with undervolting, but if the reduction is not enough or stability suffers (my 12900k can only handle about -0.030 before prime 95 small ffts w/avx starts to crash) then power limiting is his next best option - probably better than outright clock limiting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

gotcha.,"i had a cooler master, but the usb drivers on it broke and it wouldnâ€™t work correctly.",i might invest in one soon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
prochot means the cpu is overheating and has hit the thermal throttling point (100c).,if itâ€™s stuck at 800mhz then iâ€™d say the situation is pretty severe.,possibly the cpu fan has failed?,check to see if under the motherboard section thereâ€™s any rpm monitors.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"fyi prochot can be caused by other related hardware (chipset, vrm, etc.)","hitting a temp limit that causes the cpu to throttle, as opposed to the cpu core itself.","i have seen this behavior twice in laptops:  

once was a cheap gaming laptop which provided insufficient chipset cooling and would trip prochot when doing certain functions (gaming @2k outputting usb-c to display port).",cpu and other vitals were ok in this scenario.,the other computer was a dell work laptop that had a damaged cooling component which i didn't fully diagnose.,"the cpu also was not overheating, but if i twisted the chassis, it would clear the prochot condition, seeming to suggest some contact cooling component wasn't making good contact.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the 11th gen runs hot.,try undervolting.,it costs nothing.,even if you undervolt the cpu hard and lose some performance it won't make a difference.,it is also possible you may get a performance increase from less heat generation.,you can't damage anything by undervolting.,so try it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's an awfully high temperature for just 35% load.,likely something is wrong with your cooler or it's still not mounted correctly.,also check your bios settings and make sure your mobo isn't pumping excess voltage to your cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i can only give you my exp from the 10400 with the stock cooler.,idle @ +40 â°c as soon as i run any game 80-90â°c.,if the contact picture of the very thin termalpaste spread between the his and the cpu looks good nothing you can do other then limiting p1 p2 limits in the bios.,investing in new paste is a waste of money for the stock cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if you remove a cpu cooler you should change the thermal paste.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seems totally normal for the stock cooler.,you can get a way better cooler for around 30 to 40$,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"don't buy thermal paste, it doesn't make a big difference.",if you are in the usa go to /hardwareswap and ask if someone can give you a spare budget tower cooler.,they cost around 20-30 usd and sure someone will have one to spare if you pay shipping.,sometimes people post their spare budget stop and give them for free if people pay the shipping feel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
definitely try undervolting.,depending on the motherboard it may limit you to -50mv but you can always use other programs if you want to undervolt past the motherboard limit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

good point but iâ€™m currently playing gta iv on a linux based ultraportable x86 device.,that is a notoriously difficult to run game especially on amd hardware ime.,i donâ€™t know how valve has been able to pull this off but theyâ€™ve put a serious investment into software development and it shows.,it didnâ€™t happen overnight.,i get that theyâ€™re using open source software and adding heavily to it but at the end of the day so is intel.,directx is a standard thatâ€™s been around for a long time.,intel isnâ€™t new.,theyâ€™ve been producing shitty display drivers for decades.,ffs their igps didnâ€™t support source engine titles for about a decade.,theyâ€™ve never invested in display driver software and iâ€™m skeptical that theyâ€™re spending much now at least compared to the competition.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
knowing that their original intention was to farm out all display driver development to a team in russia is supposed to give me confidence in intel?,the company who owns the windows display driver market yet didnâ€™t even support source engine for about a decade?,"yeah, this doesnâ€™t help their case.",how much does nvidia spend on software development?,jensen hwang once called nvidia a software company since thatâ€™s where the bulk of their r&d is spent.,and theyâ€™re competing with that with a single team in russia?,that was going to work wellâ€¦..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">theyâ€™ve never invested in display driver software

why would they do that before now?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> knowing that their original intention was to farm out all display driver development to a team in russia is supposed to give me confidence in intel?,outsourcing development isn't that unheard off.,"usually the grunt work of programming is done in countries with lower wages like eastern europe, russia and india.",for the price of one silicon valley developer you can employ a whole team in other parts of the world.,"intel is trying to jump start a new division here, so it is to be expected that while they make an effort it will not be on the same scale as amd or nividia who have been in this game for a lot longer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because the vast majority of windows display adapters are made by intel.,amd doesnâ€™t seem to have the same issues with their igp software.,but letâ€™s fanboy it up and give them a free pass.,are you going to put your money where your mouth is and buy an intel video card for your gaming rig?,since you have so much faith.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if theyâ€™re investing far less i expect the product to cost a lot less.,software is probably the most important part of the package.,"(as steve from gn has made very clear)

the bulk of their costs should be spent on software right now.",how can they possibly catch up if theyâ€™re that far behind and currently spending less on software development?,i have no faith in intels driver support.,none.,theyâ€™ve done an awful job over the decades compared to their competition.,they have a lot to prove.,we arenâ€™t talking about programming a single game or application here.,they have a long way to go.,not something i expect a single russian team to be able to do,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gamers nexus recently did a video in which they touched on the intel gpu's.,the basic gist of it was that we need to give it another 24 months or so.,this is new territory for intel and there are only so many problems you can solve by throwing money at it.,intel needs time to straighten out their new products.,i wasn't really expecting that their first outing would take the gpu market by storm.,they really need some time and maybe a new generation of cards for things to really start taking off.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"youâ€™re interpreting those videos differently than i.

i seem to recall the initial video being a flat out do not buy this unless you enjoy playing with new hardware and beta testing.",i also recall a follow up video chastising intel for adding new features that donâ€™t work when the basic driver package is unusably bad.,intel has been developing windows drivers for decades.,iâ€™ve switched between nvidia and amd several times and never needed third party driver removal software.,with intel you may need to manually remove registry info if the driver decides to bork itself or between updates.,again intel currently isnâ€™t investing remotely enough into software development for their video cards to ever actually compete with nvidia.,after typing this comment i also recall steve from gn saying that they have a long way to become the number 2 player and thatâ€™s the mindset that they need now.,steve in no way recommended this product nor seemed confident in intel long term,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah itâ€™s not a particularly positive video on intel.,also doesnâ€™t discredit a single thing that iâ€™ve said.,intelâ€™s display driver software has been inexcusably poor for decades.,theyâ€™re not starting from scratch and if they are that speaks volumes on their support so far considering they own the windows display adapter market and have for decades.,that thought process i completely disagree with gn on but i understand them trying to give intel a chance.,steve has made it clear even in that video that heâ€™s skeptical.,"the info in the article in no way helps intels case

edit: doesnâ€™t steve also go as far as to compare intel to google on how quickly theyâ€™ll drop things that theyâ€™ve dumped a ton of money into in that very video?",steve has had a firm not recommended wait and see approach for intel video cards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you know a lot of non-public information based on your statements.,"and as if discrete gpus are even in the same ballpark as integrated for firmware and software development, or as if nvidia doesn't have large driver teams in russia and eastern europe.",lots of wild assumptions and speculation being passed off as facts in this thread imo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what do you mean even if?,does amd deliver a different driver package for every architecture?,these are both publicly traded companies.,r&d spending is public info.,or are we talking about driver teams locations?,obviously nvidia doesnâ€™t have a just a single driver development team in russia.,"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4526817-intel-r-and-d-needs-more-bang-needs-more-buck

did you update your bios?,"your p-core vids look fine, albeit strangely uniform with zero variation between 8 p-cores, but the e-core vid is way too high at 1.508v.",e-cores should be between 1.15-1.2x volts and not 1.508v which skewed your e-core sp and overall sp ratings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12900ks sp scores are not comparable to 12900k sp scores.,the absolute worst 12900ks p-core score i've heard of is 88. most 12900kses are around 95.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wow, never heard of bio's giving benchmark scores like this before.",we've really come far in their development if they can do this now.,wonder how much longer till we have something like cinebench built into the bios or at the least the capability to install benchmarks to bios.,now that would be cool.,we'd be able to get the truest benchmark score of all since no os would be in the way reducing it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
definitely looks like an error reading or displaying the vid table.,"i seriously canâ€™t imagine any situation where every core would be identical like that, even e-cores (unless they literally forgot to add the vid table).","could be a bios issue, motherboard issue, or even a cpu issue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"check markings on ihs if they're genuine 12900ks and welcome to the abysmal e cores sp club - my 12700k got 35 :d. and 95 sp on 12900ks is still better overclocker, than 95 sp on 12900k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean it's obviously wrong lol.,every single core has the exact same vid including the e-cores?,that's impossible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you have any data to compare?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

older bioses from before 1504  from asus can mis read sp score u need bios 1504 or newer.,if thats 12900 ks and the p cores are true sp 92 i would return that  those e cores are mega bad if true .,"my first 12900 ks from [newegg.ca](https://newegg.ca) was  sp 104 p core and 82 e cores  5.2 ghz auto vid is 1.23v passes y cruncher 54 / 51 ring 24/7   


my 2nd 12900 k is sp 90  p cores and sp 78 e cores it needs 1.38v for 52 p cores to pass y cruncher vs sp 104 12900 ks that needs 1.23v .",id reflash to the newest 1504 bios or newer re check if true i would talk to amazon for sure thats a dud,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m glad it is resolved but i had 10980xe with 63 sp.,so 72 sp is possible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this is stock settings and not overclocked, and all limits are enforced",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™m worried about the e core score, or is the only thing binned with the 12900ks the p core?",this is the lowest sp score in total i have found anywhere online.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my early batch (nov. 2021) 12900k has a p-core sp of 95, and an e-core sp of...... *67*",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if youâ€™re referring to the cpuâ€™s sp score, itâ€™s not actually a benchmark, itâ€™s a calculation of silicon quality based on the unique vid table saved to each cpu by intel during testing, on what voltage is required for what frequency.",lower voltages = higher sp score.,"asus has their own algorithm based on data they accumulate for each cpu model, which they use to estimate ai overclocking potential.","the cooler sp score can fluctuate a lot and is kind of just based on accumulated runtime data, also used for the ai overclocking algorithm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
main issue would be the fact that bios have a small amount of memory to work with.,"i think the top end bioses use roms that have a capacity around 256mb, with another rom for backup.","cinebench r23 is around 250mb by itself, so unless someone's willing to put half a gigabyte of rom and another as a backup for bios and a automated benchmarker, i highly doubt that would happen.",or asus could prove me wrong.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i ended up rolling back bios to 1403 and it came up as a 87 so 95/73, weird iâ€™ve never had this happen https://postimg.cc/62nbj66w",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

get yourself a legitimate sp110+ cpu and see if anyone in r/overclocking cares!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you let asus get their way, itâ€™ll easily be pushed up to 1.5v by â€œaiâ€",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
none of those settings affect the vid readouts or sp rating.,what does affect those is the version of the bios you're running.,"you can get the latest bios direct from asus' website, place it on a usb drive and flash your bios to the latest version.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my 12700k is 86 for reference,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh that's cool.,maybe my next mobo will be asus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i know lenovo got a lot of flak several years ago when they had software that would auto install from bios to the os, so their bios was like gigs big so possible to have larger bioses.","maybe as time goes on they'll just standard have more memory to play with, who knows.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> i think the top end bioses use roms that have a capacity around 256mb, with another rom for backup.","cinebench r23 is around 250mb by itself

bios chip sizes are listed as the raw flash package size, so its in mbit.",256 mbit == 32 mbyte.,the cinebench installer is eight times the size of the bios storage.,"you can check this yourself, go download your own bios, the zip is like 10 mb, the actual file that gets flashed uncompresses to [~33.5 mb == 256 mbit.","](https://i.imgur.com/nvd2kag.png)

"itâ€™s the latest 1720 bios, on the z690 formula",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hopefully yea, but i dont see this as something that most consumer boards will have, if it even will exist.",most likely on xoc boards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh lol thatâ€™s even worse then.,"i donâ€™t doubt that someone could probably create a very very light variant for bios but again, a bit too niche to be something that would be introduced to consumer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"itâ€™s not the be-all or end-all of overclocking potential (there are other factors that can make a lower sp score cpu a good overclocker), but itâ€™s a fairly accurate assessment of a cpuâ€™s general ability.",definitely not a useless number.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
turn off your pc and clear cmos.,it can sometimes fix a bugged sp rating.,"if the sp ratings still persist, then you have a really strange chip in your hands.","one where for some reason, intel programmed 1.508v for all cores at their max multipliers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
use an older version.,the 1720 caused issues for me with undervolting not being applied.,even though it was set it didnâ€™t show in hwinfo and the temps were off the charts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1720 bios is really buggy and i highly recommend reverting to 1601.,1720 breaks a lot of functionality with voltage management and changing clock settings of things like the rinbus and igpu.,perhaps it is affecting the way sp scores are calculated as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this was actually done over a decade ago.,asus for a period had something called expressgate which was a cut down linux distro on motherboards.,they also had some higher end ones with enough space for full fledged ones.,there wasnt much demand for it and modern uefi takes care of the majority of things people used it for.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i must mention i didnâ€™t touch any setting, i flashed the latest bios, and i didnâ€™t turn on ai overclocking, in this picture, also i cleared cmos and got the same results, iâ€™ll try the 12900ks in my other z690 extreme when i can, but at this point i might just ship it back to amazon, unfortunately i have to tear down my custom loop.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

most of these promotions i've used myself involved having to register the product with some proof of purchase.,afterwards you'll receive an activation key you can use to claim the game on the specified platform.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do u get a code for steam or battle net ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just and fyi several yt videos of this process if you look up how to register your free mw w/ battle net..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is my concern.,i will take the risk anyway.,i am selling the cpu but i already have a 12700k that will hopefully allow me to activate it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i registered the key with intel.,they have battle.net logos on the web page.,but i don't know if they will give me a game key to enter to battle.net.,they might ask me to link my accounts and the game would show up automatically.,i will know this once they send me the instructions when game launches.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

for me personally iâ€™m excited by raptor lake - but 14th gen is extremely interesting because of all of the new technologies under hood.,"- multiple chips from different manufacturers/process nodes

protip: buy tok (not tick).,motherboard firmware is generally more mature after the first gen of an architectural change.,i would go with 13th gen (instead of 14) because of the many bios fixes established by that point and the stability is greater.,"to each their own, however.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

14th gen core according to leaks) will not bring major architectural changes to big cores (little cores will be new) like 12th gen. however, because of intel 4 process it will be much more efficient - *intel 4 (i4) promises a 21.5% improvement in frequency at the same power as the previous-gen i7 process, or 40% less power.",* i hope intel goes after 7ghz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whatâ€™s wrong with e-cores?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
efficiency gains will be used for performance rather than to reduce power limits.,"this was the approach with 12th gen which is actually very efficient even compared to zen 3, you will find the idle to medium load power draw is quite low compared to other cpus.","but, rather than reduce peak power usage you increase the performance/boost speeds.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is exactly what i'm doing.,"meteor lake will be a new node, new compute architecture, and disaggregated 'chiplets'.","raptor lake will be last and best of the monolithic dies and on a mature platform, with new pcie 5 and ddr5.",i expect it will be a very good platform for a very long time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
truth be told intel was right to rename their nodes.,it is not helpful if the node numbers aren't remotely comparable in performance.,intel 7nm is now marketed as intel 4. compared to tsmc that makes much more sense as what used to be named intel 7nm significantly outperforms tsmc 7nm and is in fact much closer to where tsmc 4nm would be (though it might lag that node slightly).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7nm and 10nm are marketing terms though that are rather meaningless and don't relate to anything objective in the process.,"the reason intel has started using the terms 'intel 7' and 'intel 4' is these make a more apple to apples comparisons to nodes from tsmc, samsung etc in terms of density and power consumption.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
talking about 10nm or 7nm just creates extra confusion.,the nodes are called intel 7 and intel 4. they compete against tsmcâ€™s n7 and n5 node families.,none of it has anything to do with nanometers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

12 is both a tick and a tock in the same generation.,"13th gen will count as neither, as it is same arch and process node.",hence the tick and tock is no longer being followed.,"yet 13th gen still has significant optimisations that will see a big performance boost, even though it's neither a tick or a tock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,the performance increase from 10th-11th gen was basically nonexistent but 12th gen alder lake brought a huge upgrade.,13th gen raptor lake will just be a refined alder lake and would therefore be considered a â€œtokâ€,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"imo, tick-tock as a concept for intel process-architecture ended when 14 and 10nm generations had issues continuing that cycle.","there was briefly a third optimization cycle giving a [process-architecture-optimization](https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/intel/process-architecture-optimization) concept, which played out as broadwell as the first 14nm process, skylake as the architecture improvement, and kaby-coffee-whiskey-comet lakes all optimizations of 14nm while 10nm had issues.","cannon lake was supposed to be first process step of adaption skylake microarch to 10nm, still had problems, and icelake was architecture step where process started catching up as well.",tiger lake is optimization of icelake.,"now, i consider this end of p-a-o mindset in response to all difficulty and endless 14nm.","rocketlake fits here with tiger lake as gears shift and hybrid core enters alder lake(12th) and raptor lake (13th), which is kinda like an optimization or formerly a tock step, improving alder.",meteorlake (14th) is summarized best as disaggregated architecture.,"it's 4 different designs/silicon nodes together, it's both an arch and process step in that sense.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
correct.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's a completely different approach to chiplets.,amd is all about reusing and maximizing yield.,intel's approach instead focuses on making specialized products by mixing & matching different chiplets like lego building blocks.,also intel believes that product development cycles will be shorter with this tiled approach.,i guess this also makes dealing with process yield issues easier.,like if their 20a is terrible they can port it to tsmc or back port it to older node and still get the product out with a less severe delay.,"they don't have to go through the whole process again, only that exact component needs to be ported, and they don't have to touch the rest of the chip",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hard to say.,"brand new processes usually take time to get them ready for high clocks, and this looks like mobile first for 14th gen.

"you ignore 20% higher single and light thread performance, along with double the bandwidth on the dmi lanes to the chipset, and pcie 4.0.   all of those things are going to give rocket lake more life than gen 10 has left, since intel saw fit to essentially keep the same connectivity on gen 10 as you had on a z170.",i'm saying that as someone with a 10850k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's not just a matter of refinement - that's i think more applicable to 14mm which they refined to the moon.,"what i'm talking about here really is the reported transistor density, which is arguably kind of in line with how the original nm nomenclature was used by all foundries - as a measure of physical dimensions.",the problem is that there was no consensus on what physical feature should be measured and it's kind of hard to reach a consensus because different designs may be equally small overall but differ in their subdimensions due to architectural differences.,that's why transistor density per square mm2 is now considered among the best easily understood objective markers that determine how advanced a node really is.,"with tsmc currently leading the market and with their 7nm and 5nm factual transistor densities given, it was a sensible move by intel to rename.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel 10 was always about the same density as tsmc n7.,tsmc itself has said the numbers no longer mean anything other than general improvement.,"this all started long ago, but became a runaway train wreck when tsmc/samsung named their 20nm nodes ""14/16nm"" when they added finfet to them.","when intel went from 22nm to 14nm that was both a node shrink and adding finfet, so intel 14nm was actually a half node (35%) more dense than tsmc/samsung 14/16nm nodes.","tsmc didn't actually have a node more dense than intel 14nm until they hit 10nm, which was essentially a half-node shrink vs intel's 14nm.",intel 4 is expected to be significantly more dense than tsmc n4 and land in between tsmc n3 and n4.,"see article below :

""to that end, we estimate intel 4 at 123.4 mtr/mmâ², 2.04x from 60.5 mtr/mmâ² in intel 7. our data for tsmc n5 is very much incomplete but our rough estimates based on known pitches put their hp library at 94.85 mtr/mmâ².","based on most of the recent publically available foundry data, intel 4 hp cells appear denser than tsmc n5 hp and are likely closer to or better than tsmc n3 hp cells and denser than samsungâ€™s 3gae.

if you want to see how zen4 does at 65w you set a power limit.,you canâ€™t talk about that question without talking about power limits.,amd â€œtdpâ€ designations also indirectly define power limits.,also your comment about zen3 is completely wrong.,in general alderlake tends to be slightly more efficient in most workloads at higher power levels.,zen3 wins at low power levels.,certainly nowhere near 2-3 times at either direction.,you can compare 12400 with 5600x for example.,it is practically impossible to make 12400 consume more than 75w and it generally matches the performance of 5600x.,where is the 2-3 times?,you get those large differences when you take smaller cpu and try to make it match the performance of bigger cpu.,you do that by making the smaller cpu run very fast which is always inefficient.,thatâ€™s why a 5950x will always be more efficient than anything intel does that is not at least a 16big core cpu.,you get very inefficient by not setting limits and instead seeking the maximum performance.,intel gets maybe 5-10% more performance for the last 50% of power.,"amd by default doesnâ€™t do that, they set a lot stricter limits to performance to limit power use.",which is one reason why an alder lake core fairly significantly outperforms a zen3 core.,try to match alderlake core by overclocking a zen3 core and see the efficiency disappear.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there is a reason why e-cores are 4 times smaller than p-cores.,it's quite obvious that some (serious) tradeoffs has to be done to make it possible.,the beauty of not having e-cores was that you just don't care which process runs on which core.,they are all same.,now they are not same.,there is a serious problem for os to define what process should run on which core.,if you think a bout it a bit you will understand that this task is much harder than it looks.,"when i first heard something like ""p for foreground, e for background"" - that's when i got extremely alerted and started to think about this.","and quickly realized that salesman are operating with some ""generic usecase example"" where important processes are those that are running in foreground.",this is true for narrow spectre of use cases.,"the number of people in such usecases may be huge, but it's still the small portion of all possible scenarious for something that is called ""universal computing machine"".","now, the problem that i personally have is that i use computer for work / computation / stuff.","i will end up letting os to assign my custom soft and vms running in background to e-cores, while my browser or some light game will sit on p-core because it is on foreground and i'm just messing around waiting for computation results.","at the end of the day, my main work will take longer to complete, because e-cores are far from p-cores single thread performance.",it's like jumping on few families old cpu.,"magic will not happen, and 100500 e-cores will not make my 4-thread process to finish as fast as on p-cores.","avoiding even more specific things, that's pretty much it... as an example: i have 8 core cpu.",i can run 2 4-threaded computations in parallel.,if i buy 16p cpu - i can run 4 computations in parallel.,"if i buy 8p 666e cpu - i can run 2 computations fast and 2 computations slow, because i have only 4 computations to do, and extra e does not make any difference.",so for me 16p will be much better than 8p 999e.,what i am trying to say is that if you make a step away from marketing examples into other usecases that were totally ok on all-p cpus to the extent that nobody even realized it's beauty - you get many headaches with these e's.,and again - i just can not take it why they did not make all-p model?,"pack 16 p's on the die, put the price, and sell it.","why, oh why they take away this option in such crucial thing as cpus, where you only have 2 manufacturers and will end up in big trouble if both of them decide for a bad move!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you're dang right.,the 13400 is actually like the [12600k in disguise](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/134589/intel-core-i512600k-processor-20m-cache-up-to-4-90-ghz/specifications.html).,"a bit lower clock speeds, and 8 more graphics eus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"from what i've seen the 13400 is actually alderlake refresh, not the full raptorlake implementation.",so if you want the bump you need to go to the 13600,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

went from 3570k to 12400f.,changed my life.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

nice.,i have my computer that controls all of my wife and i's 3d printing and art projects that still runs a 4670k.,haswell era chips were really good.,my server that handles a lot in my house still uses a 4790. i also think i'm going to have a nice upgrade with this generation with that one.,"i wonder with the huge performance upgrade from jumping up a haswell to raptor lake as it is, does it make more economic sense to just go with an i5 this generation and save some money over the i7.",the 13500/13600 would be my ideal chip for sure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

250+ seems more likely",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

meaning if that happens this gen will be great for us!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i actually bought a lot of intel stock figuring that theyâ€™d have the upper hand this upcoming generation and claw back market share from amd.,amd is at the mercy of their fab partners for pricing since tsmc raised fab pricing so much.,"but amd still has the energy advantage which datacenters care a lot more about and unfortunately i also invested right before the market dived off a cliff ðÿ˜‚

i think intel will regain the upper hand the next few years though as they recover from their fab bungles.",being able to control their own fab pricing will be a big strength,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bait for wenchmarks though.,plus am5 may be the better platform due to zen4 v-cache and zen5 v-cache...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hopefully this would make amd release a hybrid zen4 and zen4c core cpu.,would be interesting how they would compete against each other.,if raptor lake is as good as it appears we should have good competition for a while.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
only if raptor lake has a decent ipc uplift i'm afraid.,"those zen 4 chips are clocking ridiculously high, and have 10% ipc improvement to boot.","if rl ipc is almost the same as adl, then a 4.1 ghz i5 should theoretically lose pretty badly to a 5 ghz zen 4 cpu (if zen 4 ipc is roughly on par with intel this gen)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is dead regardless at that price same for the 7700/7800,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it should be 140 , not 200 it is xx600 range.. dont get be fooled if is something new gen and its better than older we dont want to pay for same level more money",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"13400f is alder lake, not raptor, don't pronounce 7600x dead yet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unfortunately ecc support requires both processor and chipset to have it enabled.,alder lake has ecc support starting with the i5-12500 (some i3 variants also have it but they're for the embedded market and not easily available).,"however if you [compare chipset specs on ark](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/compare.html?productids=218834,218832,218829,218831,218833), you'll find that only the w680 chipset has ecc support.",try to find a w680 motherboard and they're all industrial class ones from asrock rack and supermicro that clock in over $400.,it's likely this will be the same for raptor lake with the price segmented workstation chipset being the only one to support ecc and will be available only on pricey industrial boards.,very frustrating.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this is a necro-comment, but -t variants just have lower peak power usage, they aren't really any different than non-t. might as well just downclock/power limit a non-t instead of spending more on a -t.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"fyi, you can always limit the tdp in the bios.",my gigabyte motherboard has a 65 watt tdp toggle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"you're silly, if you want to throw money away then sure go on raptor lake.","if you're clever you'd buy 5800x3d which is basically just as fast as  13700k / 12900k for gaming, put it in your mobo, sell the 3700x, done.",you saved 300$ at least.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"depending on how much you paid for 12700k, there is nothing to fomo here.",12700k for mid $300s was really good deal over the summer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

except 13400/13400f still get 10 cores (6+4) where 12100 is 4+0.,cache is also 20mb vs 12mb for the 12100.   boost to 4.6 ghz instead of 4.3 ghz.,"itâ€™s still quite an upgrade, whether itâ€™s alderlake or a smaller raptorlake.","(also notice 13700 has same basic specs as 12900k - cache, cores; yet is b0 stepping like 13400 and 13900k..  iâ€™m not sure these are really re-used alderlake dies or on the same exact process as adl.",weâ€™ll know when we see review samples and voltage/frequency curves for each).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also a 6700k owner --> 13900k!,"i can't believe cpus are >2x faster in single thread and, well, essentially infinity times faster in multi thread than skylake era chips.",feels like we've been stuck in the age of single-digit improvements in performance for forever.,i'm ever so grateful to amd for lighting a fire underneath intel and nvidia's asses and making 2022 q4 the greatest hardware quarter in a long time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
went from a 6700k to an 11900k and that was huge.,this upgrade for you will be massive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm pretty psyched.,"the i7 is probably a better fit, but i'm thinking about going for the 13900k because in reality i'm likely only going to upgrade every 8-10 years.",i've realized that a lot of the mainstream advice out there is meant for people who upgrade cpus/gpus every few years.,i'd go with ddr5 if i were you.,"you can always upgrade to a better kit for cheap down the line, ddr4 is as good as it's ever going to be.",i'm going straight from ddr3 to ddr5 and don't feel like i missed out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14th gen and onwards will likely be ddr5 only so get ddr4 if you're not planning to upgrade in years and get ddr5 if you plan to upgrade again in the near future.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
goes on sale all the time too.,got it for $150.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"amd's still keeping am4 around for their budget offerings for the foreseeable future and my guess is it won't be until 2023 at the earliest when lower-tier, sub-$200, sub-7600 desktop chips are released for am5.","even then, the sub-7600 am5 chips will probably only be available to oems since that's what amd's been doing with most of their low-end chips over the last 2-3 years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
agree.,we need a cheap ryzen3 or athlon to compete at the lower end.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
external clock generator?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
vast majority of pc builders arenâ€™t from developed countries and what may seem like a 50$ difference in the us may be more like 150$ elsewhere.,combine this with terrible wages and you get the picture.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
on lower end builds every dollar matters and $20 at the system integrator level is like $40 at retail.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you are willing to wait a bit for shipment you can have a decent cooler from aliexpress for under $20 bucks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if itâ€™s 200$ will be fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12400f was 180 so 20% is 220. decent price against the 7600x still.,and the 7600x requires a mininum 40$ cooler maybe more.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
up to 10-20% on some products.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it must otherwise the 7600x is toast.,and the 7700x for 299.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
look at servers and mobile for the stock.,diy is a tiny niche market used mostly for marketing.,but servers amd is dominating and eating up intel market share like cake,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s possible the 13400 is faster even than the 7700x in almost everything while being almost half the price.,we will see.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all amd could do is release a 65w 7600 non x cpu bundled with the wraith stealth for 199$ which would be awesome.,designing a whole new chip like you suggested requires millions and time which will be better spent accelerating the release of zen 5 which may actually be a hybrid architecture.,currently however we seem to be going for a very close derby in the top end in which buyers will need to actually see in which tasks the 13900k or the 7950x is faster in order to make an informed decision.,amd also has the advantage of future upgradeability.,however from the 7700x and below amd seems to be a terrible value buy.,if the 13600kf is priced at 279 for example or even close to 325 with possibly faster p-cores than the entirety of the 7600x with the addition of the e-cores will amd look like a joke.,intel can take a lot of mindshare here.,if they make the next socket last for 3+ gens they can completely destroy amd in the mid-low end where most gamers actually buy desktop.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">hopefully this would make amd release a hybrid zen4 and zen4c core cpu

if there was a zen 4 + zen 4c hybrid cpu that would face raptor lake, then amd would have probably disclosed at least some details about it by now",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"at 200-250 and the ddr4 prices,its competing with zen3 not zen4.",7600x competes against i7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

zen 3 was like 20-25% behind(not really visible on pc gaming).,rpl doesnâ€™t need much to match or even surpass it while being a node behind.,a 10% uplift rpl all it needs to spice thing up bigly.,"also, ipc doesnâ€™t scale linearly.",4 to 6ghz may not be a 50% uplift will depend on the task and the cpu architecture.,amd has huge pricing power as they are being very greedy right now.,raptor can cut that greed short very quickly.,wise choice to release the 13400 early.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12400f was 180 and inflation is a real thing so 200 is a great price for the direct successor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12600kf current pricing is a better deal than the 7600x imagine that for 200$ instead,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

amd is not forced to use chiplets for such cpus",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it shouldnâ€™t steal manufacturing capacity from the other chips.,"low end (i3 range) chips are usually the same expect cpu as the higher end skus, but just lost the silicon lottery.",maybe some cores donâ€™t work or it it doesnâ€™t clock as high.,"they then fuse the chip down to the specs of the lower end sku and bam, they can sell a faulty chip.",so either amd had such good manufacturing tolerances that they donâ€™t have low performing chips (doubtful) or they are throwing away bad performers/ sending them off to another project.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah that plus the potential to use much more affordable ddr4 means more budget oriented builds will very heavily favor intel.,"can use that savings towards going up a tier on your gpu or doubling your storage, etc.",amd is in serious trouble for the consumer segment.,theyâ€™ll be able to hold onto datacenter for now i think due to energy efficiency so intel will probably focus more on that for 14th gen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well iâ€™m holding long term on this one and i think theyâ€™ll be able to get server share back in the next couple of years, plus thereâ€™s the potential mobileye spinoff that i like.","but yeah, right now the server side is ungood.",i think theyâ€™ll do fine in all consumer sales this gen though including mobile.,"not just looking at diy, the system integrators care about stuff like ddr4 support as well since a laptop that costs $100 more because it has ddr5 isnâ€™t going to help with sales to normal consumers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that would be great as it would also force amd to lower prices!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think bottom of the barrel 65w 7600 should compete just fine with 13400 in gaming.,i think zen 4's advantages vs. raptor are more prominent in that lower power range.,that's also why genoa will absolutely destroy sapphire and emerald rapids.,"difference in efficiency at low power, between golden cove and zen 4 is massive",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if only amd had a chiplet design.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but my comment wasn't about the 13900k.,we were talking about the 13400 and the 7600x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
true about inflation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i see 12600kf costing \~295 usd in shops, which is just a terrible deal for an i5.","right now, am5 is going to get full premium, but b650 should follow early 2023 and i surely hope 2023 will bring in price cuts, cuz it's going off rails currently on every side, gpu, motherboard and ram.","ddr5 is dropping price, but they're still mad expensive for amount of hassle required to make them not suck a deck.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i wouldn't be worried.,"it's certainly not ideal given how easily temperatures can be improved with an aftermarket ilm, but temperatures can still be pretty easily kept in safe ranges.",i'd call it unoptimized but serviceable.,slight bending isn't something unprecedented for chips either.,you can find examples of bent cpus from both amd and intel under various circumstances.,(usually cooler mount related),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"itâ€˜s not like theyâ€˜re bananas, couple of nanometers, the pins are long enough.","if the temp increases by 5c in 3 years and you donâ€™t like to increase rpm on the fan, you repaste.",itâ€˜s called maintenance and itâ€™s been always like that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this sentiment i totally get.,"not only the $10, but in case i need to rma my board and forget to reattach the original ilm, it'll surely get rejected too!","why should i be the one to fucking shoulder it...

i guess we'll see.,"intel is supposedly implementing dlvr in raptor lake, which is supposed to improve efficiency by 20-25% or more by reducing voltage by ~160mv on average.","i'd imagine this is more important at higher voltages than lower voltages when it comes to tdp, and it may explain why we're seeing such high boost clocks compared to alder lake.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"raptorlake is not a rerelease of alderlake, like zen4 it has changes in the uncore and other parts of the cpu to make it have better power at certain clocks and better performance.",especially performance of e cores which will have far better latencies and clock better with same l2$ jump as zen4 had from zen3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12600k but max all core frequency locked to 4.1ghz which is a shame,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"with their current product segmentation, i canâ€™t really see there being a great many dies that are still at all usable but cannot fit anywhere else in their product stack.",itâ€™s already very well segmented given what they have to work with.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes itâ€™s usually the cheapest stuff for the price of premium.,i bet h610 chipsets are the norm along with 12100f.,cost for these two likely over 400 usd.,us below 200$.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nah they are slowly being upgraded to ryzen 2000/3000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">if $20 to $30 is going to be an issue no matter how cheap the build is, then you got your priorities wrong in life.",are you advocating with a straight face that the very best use for $20-30 for anyone in the world is a cpu cooler?,i'd consider saving those for therapy for gas (gear acquisition syndrome) if i were you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
currently a 12600kf build offers a much better price to performance than a potential 7600x build.,let alone raptor lake.,server amd has huge advantage if intel steps up their node development they have a chance to catch up if tsmc slows down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
possible is no certainty.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it would murder the 13400 at the same wattage.,amd takes the efficiency cake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
needs scheduling and synchronization with the i/o die to work.,and additional microcode.,architectures take years to develop for a reason,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you'd kind of expect there to be a performance difference when the 7600x will cost +50% for the cpu alone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

some say its 4.4 some say its 4.1 so until then we shall see.,"and if due to ryzen 7xxx and raptor lake they do big sales on alder, can just get a 12600kf for 220-240 hopefully.",it's an upgrade regardless.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes its because people are willing to pay that and amd/intel would gladly take that cash from you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lots of reasons.,also the prices of cpu's were not inflated by crypto so they wont be following the exact same trend as gpu's.,so they were just high to begin with and are now rising with current inflation issues.,they are overpriced imho though so.. would be nice if a realignment happened.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it depends on the chipset and motherboard.,original pentium used fpm or edo 72-pin simms in pairs.,later chipsets added sdram (pc66 or pc100).,"pentium pro, pentium 2, and pentium 3 use roughly the same platform although the physical socket changed twice (same chipset between sockets and to some extent there were adapters to go forwards/backwards).","so throughout the years they could take anything from fpm or edo 72-pinn simms, sdram (pc66-pc133), and some of the final chipsets had ddr1.",but the vast majority used sdram as the pentium pro wasn't common and the ddr1 chipsets didn't provide enough of a performance difference to really justify them.,(as is the case with every memory generation transition.),the pentium 4 through its history had chipsets for a lot of different types of memory.,"early chipsets used rambus rd-ram, but other chipsets with sdram (uncommon) and ddr1 (very common in both single and dual channel).",later ddr2 was also available although uncommon for socket 478.  the lga775 pentium 4/d had chipsets with ddr2 and ddr3.,"(it's probably possible for the later chipsets to support a socket 478 cpu, but i don't think this combo existed at the time.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"op, the information that you want is here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_intel_chipsets

but to give some proper context w.r.t.","popularity:

pentium + edo dram combo started becoming popular with the 430fx (triton) chipset, the first really successful platform for pentium.","continued with 430hx at the higher end, with ecc support and cacheable area up to 512mb, and 430vx at the lower end.","but later versions of 430vx (along with 430tx), also supported sdram.","this was in early 1997, pentium mmx era (and its main competitor the amd k6).","sometimes 430vx and 430tx were equipped with both simms (for edo) and dimms (for sdram) on the same board, but afair you'd have to choose one.","sdram dimms quickly gained popularity as they don't have to be installed in same-capacity pairs, but didn't become standard until a bit later.",pentium pro chipsets used simms (fpm/edo) exclusively.,"though there were 440fx boards made for pentium ii (slot 1 instead of socket 8), the 440lx (1997) which used sdram (only at pc-66) was the more common chipset for early p2.","that was followed by one of the most popular intel platforms ever, 440bx + pc-100 sdram combo.","the popularity continued on to pentium iii era, which the 440bx can support natively for slot 1 models, or with a ""slotket"" adapter for s370 models, but official support was limited to 100mhz fsb, otherwise you'll have to overclock the agp to use 133mhz fsb (of course with pc-133 sdram, which 440bx could use just fine).","of the chipsets that natively supported p3, the 81x series with sdram were by far the most popular chipsets because rdram was far too expensive for just a little bit more performance.","into the early pentium 4 era, intel was subsidizing rdram to try to give it some traction, but eventually stopped that and thus ddr sdram became the de facto winner.",honestly i never paid attention to (socket 478) p4 with pc-133 sdram but it might've been popular in the low-end segment (esp.,845g/gv variants).,"but for the mainstream, 865/875 + ddr-400 was when p4 (in the form of the very overclockable northwood) became really popular.","and as mentioned in the other post, with lga775 you can pair a p4 with ddr1â€“3 depending on the board.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"memory controllers were not on-cpu back in those days, so there can be variances and it depends on the motherboard/chipset.",pentium 4 started with rambus (drdram) but shifted back to ddr and then ddr2.,pentium iii will likely be ddr.,pentium 2 will be edo or sdram.,pentium 1 will be edo or fpm (thanks for the addition).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

which pentium 3 chipset came with ddr support?,"there were 82x series with rdram support however, if that's what you meant.",also i wouldn't lump in p3 together with ppro and pii as there were major changes going from 4xx series to 8xx series chipsets.,as for p4 lga775 + ddr3 that is def doable with some g41 ddr3 boards.,"otoh, ~~i'm not sure about~~ s478 + ddr2... usually it is the other way around, newer socket with older chipset + older ram.","and there surely are lga775 boards with 865 and 845 chipsets (ddr1, but not pc-133 sdram).",**edit:** found the s478 + ddr2 board!,asrock p4vm800pro-ddr2.,asrock was really the king of odd combos indeed.,"apart from some laptops, there might be some from other makers too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

via had a ddr chipset.,"https://www.anandtech.com/show/755/3

i didn't recall the rd-ram chipset for the pentium 3 so thanks for that correction.",people made tualatins run on 440bx so yes with slotkets you could run ppro and p3 on a slot 1 board (now the socket 8 slotket is unobtainium and i don't know if any board could run both it and a tualatin so it's kind of moot).,ipc wise i know pentium 2 and katmai are the same.,coppermine and tualatin are a little better but cache architecture aside the biggest difference is the clock speeds and instruction set extensions to the best of my knowledge.,"it's a bit of a gray area for sure, but i think i covered it by saying 72-pin simms would be rare.",there is at least an msi ddr2 478 board from what i recall so that's a thing even if weird.,didn't know about the ddr1 775 combo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ahh ok thank you, i stand corrected too, p3 via ddr1 really escaped my memory.","as for the cpu architecture, indeed they're from the same p6 family, from ppro to tualatin, and pentium m too.","the socket 8 slotket unfortunately only works on 440fx slot 1 boards (*edited for clarity: i meant the few that supported it, most likely even vendor-specific), afaik.",bx or lx boards won't work with it.,"and from the wiki page i linked to in the other post, the bit that says 810 has edo support is also suspect.","you're right about ddr2 s478 though, found it instantly after searching, it doesn't sound so weird now after all.","for 'retro purposes', i still keep some asus p2b & p3b-f (440bx) and p5pe-vm boards (lga775/865/ddr1/agp).",there are asrock and gigabyte versions too but someone made a custom bios for the p5pe-vm so it has the widest cpu support.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm guessing the answer is agp but i'm curious what the use case is for bothering with modding a p5pe-vm when as far as i can tell there are 3 and 4 series boards that support the full range of lga775 cpus?,just to name one example the asrock x48turbotwins-wifi but i'm sure there are many others.,i don't know if my perception of time looking back is just distorted but the socket 478+ddr2 combo still seems weird to me given it was a dead end socket and not sure why you wouldn't just do a whole platform upgrade if you were upgrading your memory anyway.,pretty sure the ddr2 chipsets launched with lga775.,but i suppose the fact that there are multiple examples indicates that the board vendors saw a market for such a combo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the bios modder probably just wanted to add wolfdale support to his own p5pe-vm, which seemed to be popular enough among lowest-end budget builders around core 2 era, who wanted to upgrade an old p4 rig to pentium dc e5x00 series.","but if you're asking me, since i'm using it mainly for win9x games (with a3d sound), the reasons are agp, ich5, and official win98se drivers.","but since my 5900xt and 7800gs wouldn't boot anymore, i'm also trying pcie alts with a 7600gt 256mb.","g41/ich7 usb 2.0 runs in win9x with some drivers (orangeware/nusb), while ich9/10 boards incl.",x48 will need to add a usb 2.0 card that has win9x driver.,"rloew's patches take care of the rest (ram>1gb, lba48).","but compatibility wise, ich5 still wins because of better dos sound support with some pci cards (related to isa dma support that was completely dropped after ich5).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4 extra e-cores is not going to make a difference in gaming,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the only somewhat sensible upgrade from 12700k is 13900k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
babeltechreviews might have some numbers.,id guess the cache and ghz might help by like 5-10% in general.,if you must buy now consider getting a 12400 which will still be very fast and then replace with 13th gen in a few months which will bring a lot more cache and faster clocks .,plug in upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"part of that is because vr is often at such a crazy high resolution you'll nearly never be cpu bound as long as you've got almost any upper end, modern cpu.",it is **overwhelmingly** on the gpu the vast majority of the time.,"i'm on an 8k x, which is 4k resolution **per eye** and while i didn't rigorously benchmark, i didn't see much of a difference between a 10700k and 12900k in what i played.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there is difference in gaming between the 12700k & 12900k, these chips are not just separated by 4 e-cores.","that being said, you'd have to be an idiot to switch from 12700k to the 12900k imo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if anything from what i've been reading they are a detriment in alot of games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
base/turbo clock speeds are completely defined by the cooling solution you have.,"maybe a 12900k will be 'binned' a bit higher so can be undervolted slightly more resulting in 100mhz higher clocks...

keep the case for now.,if you wanna buy a case in the future try to get mesh front panels with good reviews.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you could try increasing exhaust case fan speeds.,"if there's any heat 'choked' in the case (often near the top end of the case, i.e.","where the cpu cooler/motherboard vrm sits), you will get less effective heat transfer as the 'ambient temp' near the cooler is hotter, and the cooler (especially stock coolers which are downdraft) also draws in that exact hot air.","in my prebuilt, it's basically 'top surface of my case runs cool -> a cooler cpu', at the same wattage.",might drop a few degrees.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

is it possible to undervolt or maybe decrease the speed of the cpu so i get good temps with turbo on ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm pretty sure corsair 4000d airflow and lancool ii mesh are cheaper than both of your choices.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not sure if bios can do this.,"all i know is throttlestop/xtu apparently can't undervolt, as well as adjust turbo limits/ speedshift (turbo logic) maximum multiplier limit now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or maybe its just my region.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh i was wrong, i could find the lancool ii mech with same price, thanks for the suggestion i will see about it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so there's no way except getting good airflow and maybe another cooler with turbo on?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
one more (dodgy) way: power limit in bios/throttlestop.,but first you have to check the power draw you were getting when it runs at the temps you mentioned.,"&#x200b;

but when you do whatever workload that stresses the cpu and won't load the gpu, you get suboptimal performance because it doesn't consider the cpu temp.","&#x200b;

**setting thermal limits (which is probably doable in the bios, as well as throttlestop) may work too, but i am not sure if the way of throttling is spiky enough to cause frame drops.",**,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

my 9900k still kicks ass but come the 13900k it's getting put out in the cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
man i'm still on a 4th gen i7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why do you need an upgrade?,i have a 10900k and my friend still has his 9900k that still destroys in high fps games like cod or various brâ€™s.,i have money to blow on a new 13900k or 7950x but i simply will skip it.,no need for it unless itâ€™s for a business.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
kick it to me!,!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

can i have your old friend,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
congratulations on the huge upgrade!,"man, i sure do love intel's i9 boxarts.",i hope they continue these on the 13th gen even though they've stopped on the 12th.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
such a shame they stopped making that pentalotsofsides package.,i'm currently on an i9 12900k but wouldn't mind going for a 13900k once it gets released.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i donâ€™t think iâ€™ll get rid of my i9 9900k setup, iâ€™ll just start from the ground up, that thing is just too good to sell for parts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i upgraded from 6500 to 12900ks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hmmm 9900k is still good?,especially for 1440p gaming.,"but, if you're into video rendering then i can understand.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i've been tempted to upgrade my 9900k as well, but i suspect i might wait for the next gen before i pulled the trigger.","i would consider amd's upcoming offerings or waiting in another generation for intel, but i have a lot of ddr 4 ram and don't want to have to change ram type right now",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i know many who are still rocking 4790k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i5-3570k here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's more like an addiction for some people imo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
who cares,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks mate!,"i actually don't like the 12th gen design, it's very squishy due to the empty space around the golden disk.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i used this cpu for years, imo the 9900k itself is still a strong cpu, but the thing is, it is limited to pcie 3... and its already showing sign on bottlenect today and it will be worse in the future

if the 9900k was also compatible with pcie 4, i would have keep using it for at least 3/4 more years easily :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the way i look at it (selfishly) is that i have one more upgrade on my z690 w/ddr4 support motherboard and that's it.",i feel lucky that i'd even be able to utilize the ddr4 ram again so that too.,"so yeah, it's an easy upgrade for me so long as the prices are reasonable.","but if i wasn't already be on 12th gen, i'd probably looking at amd and a whole platform change -- and i really don't want to do that atm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hmmm if i were you, i would just wait for 13600k.","which should be priced just about the same as 11900k, and of course, a lot better performance.",now.... the next gen mobo prices for intel are another story.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
agreed.,not sure why the downvotes on my earlier statement.,"if you compare the benchmarks of the 9900k with the 12900k, you'll hardly see a 3-5 fps difference when playing at 1440p and above.",classic reddit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you're 100% right.,there won't be any real perceptual gains especially for what i do.,"i have a new contact frame and some expensive tg thermal paste (purchased some time ago) that i've been wanting to install but i've been lazy and frankly, my system runs good as it is.",but i always find myself getting excited when new gen stuff comes out and this upgrade (the last for me on this platform) seems like something that might satiate my appetite when the hype is at it's highest.,"we'll see, i might just install the new frame/thermal paste and oc some instead.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11700k?,can just oc it to match 11900k performance at stock.,plus they are going for a reasonable price usually if you search around.,edit: changed my mind just saw an 11900kf for $280 on amazon.,which really isn't too bad i guess.,$240 for the 11700kf.,i'd definitely spend the extra $40 on the better binned cpu though especially for overclocking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
almost nobody needs beyond 240hz.,i'd be floored if most people could point out the difference between 200 and 240hz.,"at least up to 144hz has clear benefits, but beyond that it becomes very incremental.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the cpu has a power limit.,when it has a light load the cpu doesn't draw much power so it can clock high.,but when the load on the cpu increases the clock drops accordingly because for it to clock high in that situation it would need to draw more power than it is allowed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is a good thing.,when idling you want it to use as least power as possible (if you live in eu where electric prices are insane rn) and boost to max clock speed when under load or gaming,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is this your first ever computer?,xd,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can change the power plan to high performance and the cpu will boost to 4.0ghz  all the time .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it literally says right on the image cpu, you know it can be used for more than overclocking your graphics processor right?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
run xtu and see what type of throttling the cpu is reporting when it drops to 800 mhz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
check your power adapter.,dell laptops usually are very picky about them and will severely limit the cpu power if it can't communicate properly with the power adapter or if it thinks you're using one that's not compliant (the bios usually yells at you before boot too)...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"have this exact laptop, and this happens to me sometimes.","what i did to fix it was download throttlestop, and turn off bd-prochot, reset after a little while, and turn it on again.","bd-prochot got stuck being on, which made the laptop think it has to throttle.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what's your power profile set to?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you haven't already used throttlestop, i suggest you do.",that tool was created to solve exactly this kind of problems.,the author is also a regular on techpowerup.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
shitty psu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how do i do that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm using the power adapter this laptop ships with (stock) that's fine right?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have throttlestop but the prchot 97c indicator is red saying it's overheating.,bad sensor?,"it's not 97 degrees so i will try that, thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
high performance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i do have throttlestop but i'm having a hard time getting it to work,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, it's the dell stock adapter and it's working properly but i have tried with others and it just doesn't seem to be the problem",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"do you see any warnings when powering the laptop, or when entering the bios?",the power adapter might be defective...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not necessarily a bad sensor, just sometimes stuff gets stuck.","as long as the actual temps are ok, turn it off.",bios es shut down computers when stuff gets too hot anyway.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
could you post some screenshots to imgur with ts and intel xtu?,"once you run xtu you'll immediately see ""current limit throttling"" shown at the bottom, so see what happens when you run a program that takes up cpu resource constantly.","with throttlestop, for simplicity's sake, choose the ""performance"" profile (the leftmost radio button) (and just to make sure, if if the button on the bottom says ""turn on"", also click on it).",the rest can be left as is.,"if there's no thermal issue, you should be able to tick on the topmost option (select ""high performance"" if it says ""balanced"" or ""power saver"", just in case).",but if your max temps (not the current temps when it's already throttling) are in the range of 80s-90s that would indicate thermal problems that trigger throttling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,i've been using the stock power adapter but i tried another to be sure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is 88c > 100c?,no?,there's your answer.,"https://www.intel.ca/content/www/ca/en/products/sku/192943/intel-core-i99900ks-processor-16m-cache-up-to-5-00-ghz/specifications.html

it's hard to damage the cpu because it has throttling safety built in, but in this case you didn't even reach that high of a temperature for to start doing that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"lol, you're fine dude.",you would have to try extremely hard to damage it with heat.,"at a cerrtain ""dangerous"" temp (usually 100c to 105c) the computer will shut itself off fpr protection.",you could get it that hot quite a few times and not impact the health in any meaningful way.,there are ppl that run theirs at 90c for hours each day and will be just fine.,computers are much harder to kill than people make it seem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nope.,it'll be fine.,make sure your pump in your aio isn't on the way out though.,your cpu will shut down before it cooks itself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i think someone suggested it already but disable e-cores.they still don't have the scheduler right there yet for games (who knows when they will tbh as this has been an issue since the start but i heard it got better)

i would suggest if you have a gaming rig to just disable the e-cores entirely.i've seen videos of games and people reporting less stutters overall with them off with some games being a complete stutter fest with them enabled.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
disable e-cores on bios,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you enable high performance in the game mode graphics settings?,in windows 11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
process lasso,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bios updated.,aspm disabled.,i know it because games feel unsmooth compare to my old pc so when i move mouse around it looks like something is holding gpu back.,"i noticed when i use nvidia overlay ""99% fps"" is not matching actual real time fps.",so in game my fps is 300 but 99%fps is 250 and dropped to 130 fps every 5 -10 seconds.,so something is not working well !,!,!.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the problem was cpu cores was parked because of windows 10 settings.,what fix it for me is cpu unparking tool.,e cores disabled too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it was parking from windows 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which game?,did you check dpc latency using https://www.resplendence.com/latencymon for misbehaving drivers?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
idk why but your comment got shadowbanned.,did you rerun the chipset update inf on the new motherboard?,did you carry over your old os install from a previous build?,"did you try to run ddu, reset your gpu drivers, and check that shader cache isn't set to some small size?",what's your page file size?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
was it disabling the e-cores that fixed it or re-installing w10?i saw you edited your post but you said disabling e-cores fixed the issue in another comment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">i used windows 11 but last update is broken can't open control panel so revert back to windows 10

i thought you where currently on w11.",if you use the high performance power plan it stops cores from parking bdw.atleast that's how all my cpu's have worked so far with w10.,also yea id keep e-cores disabled still if you're on a strictly gaming rig even with high performance plan/w11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i installed fresh windows 10 again 
everything is good ðÿ‘",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hi, disabling e core doesn't fix it for me.","but i think it's windows 10/11

something is not right problem is back again.",i checked temp of cpu it's low.,maybe because i use contact frame which reduce temp.,on 12900k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
naaa.doubt its the contact frame.all it does is help reduce temps and nothing else.,you could try disabling speedshift/speedstep and c-states in bios.it's a trick that still works to this day.it removes power saving features on the cpu and can help with micro stuttering.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that was a incredible deal.,i really liked 11th gen despite all the criticism.,when tuned properly and paired with fast ram the cpu will chew through games.,enjoy it!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yea frankly iâ€™m astonished at the difference in power as well as how â€œspecificâ€ those setups may be despite everyone and everything giving me the thumbs up that itâ€™ll be a solid workstation.,one and done for me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a little warm but well within the safe range.,what cooler are you running?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are good there!,performance will only drop if you reach 100 degree.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"am4 was the current socket from 2017-2022.
intel had: lga 1150, lga 1151rev1, lga 1151rev2, lga 1200, lga 1700.

even if the cpu cost the same, buying a new motherboard would offset that.","even if the motherboard was cheaper, iâ€™d have to buy one more often.","i donâ€™t upgrade every other year, so iâ€™d have to buy a new socket every time i upgrade my cpu.","even if they made the cpu more efficient, intel 10 isnâ€™t as good as tsmc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel already has taken a big hit on gross margins and you want them to further reduce the margins?,not gonna happen.,they have to get their act straight.,design a core that is efficient in terms of power and die size.,only then they could stop losing their market share to amd.,desktop: raphael and raptor lake will probably be neck to neck in the higher tier skus in terms of performance while raphael is going to consume considerably less power.,amd is going to release raphael v-cache that is going to destroy whole intel line up in cache sensitive applications like games.,mobile: phoenix is going to destroy raptor lake both in performance and efficiency.,zen 3 being considerably slow in st and less cores can still keep up against alder lake in mt in tdp constraint environment.,"zen 4 phoenix having much superior st than zen3, considerably higher clocks will going to make things worse for intel.",after all raptor lake is nothing but slightly tuned alder lake with more e cores.,putting e cores in tdp restricted environment is no solution.,"for higher tdp laptops, 55w+ amdâ€™s dragon range (raphael on notebooks) is going to be un disputed winner.","add 3d cache on top, intel canâ€™t even come close to that.",i expect intel to lose market share much faster than ever before.,server: what can i say?,genoa 96c/ genoa-x 96c/bergamo 128c vs 60/64c sapphire rapids and genoa is going to launch earlier than spr.,"its going to be all around faster, efficient and cheaper to produce.",edit: guys instead of down voting without any merit.,come up with counter argument.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think intel has people who made those kind of decisions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1) margins are already very compressed, with current inflation even maintaining prices is difficult.","2) die sizes will go up to accommodate increased core counts, this is extremely optimistic.",3) diy market just isn't important enough for this to be a priority.,how many corporate pcs are getting a new cpu dropped in?,"even in the diy market, how many do it?","4) i *think* motherboards, with lots of discrete components and being quite large, are particularly affected by inflation and shortages.","intel only controls chipset prices, which aren't cheap, but there's a huge bom outside that.",new technologies like pcie 5 and ddr5 also increase manufacturing costs.,"5) starting your marketing plan with ""slightly worse"" isn't very good.","that said, if amd cranks up tdp and heat, it would be funny to see meteor lake push the efficiency angle.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did a similar post for amd in the amd sub so iâ€™ll apply for both companies.,wish me luck!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mere rivaling the god-like brand name of amd isnâ€™t enough.,needs to absolutely demolish amd in price to performance in order to destroy the amd brand name which is slowly eating away intel and making them look more and more like ibm as the years go by.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
people are now sharing that zen 4 16 core can sustain 5ghz on all cores at 65w in aid64 fpu.,i believe 13900k had 5.2ghz on 8 p cores + 4.1ghz e cores at 250w.,"so i guess zen 4 really is magic, and some people are suggesting that the mobile high power 16c zen 4 will have 5ghz all core at base power lmao",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
raptor lake comes with a whopping 1% ipc uplift and you can take that to the bank.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're forgetting the vcache stacked chips coming a few months after launch.,"now seeing how the 5800x version of those did in games and that was 1st gen on slower cores, you can bet the new ones will be something special.",competition benefits us all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s why one of the steps is to make sure a socket supports at least 3 generations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel is losing marketshare in all segments.,in servers intel is utter garbage compared to amd so that is expected.,however in the other two segments it just comes down to image perception and the brand name amd created for themselves as being the underdog.,"for now, as mobile will see a huge amd advantage due to the fact they will be a node ahead, therefore much better performance per watt.",fact is amd has surpassed intel in marketcap and is eating away market share in all segments.,it costs money to recreate their image especially when their execution is clearly lacking.,where is arc?,where are sapphire rapids?,"if they canâ€™t get the execution right, they better price their stuff accordingly in order to compete against the absolutely humongous god-like brand name called amd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
each company has its positives and negatives.,the problem for amd is workstationâ€¦they donâ€™t have all the market share and as corporations refresh more and more stick to intel so when your buying a oc for home what do you end up doing buying intel for your cheap laptop cause itâ€™s the same as what you use at workâ€¦enthusiastâ€™s will always be fanboys unless your like me and trying to remain hardware agnostic.,intel is innovating rapidly to be able to compete on the high end  but as long as they hold the middle of the pack and corporate workstation market (minus threadripper pro which by the way wonâ€™t have a model to compete soon enough with dual socket sapphire rapids) then amd will still be trying to grab the server and consumer gaming marketsâ€¦and if thatâ€™s all they do they will keep intel working and developingâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can't loose if you play both sides,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you joking or is this for real?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(some) of them think a 5950x magically holds 4.4ghz or whatever at the ~130w limit too haha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
zen 4 16 core aida64 at 5 ghz needs around 250w and runs crazy hot around 95 degrees c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
playing both sides will definitely leave you feeling loose.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4.4 at 130w seems reasonable?,"5ghz at 65w on all 16 cores seems impossible, unless in some really simple workload",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pretty sure some review in i think techpowerup?,"said 8 core and 16 core loads were both of similar power draw, and 16 core is around 3.6-3.8ghz.","and 'overclocked' units seem to barely do 4.5 or 4.6, yet is already running 200-240w",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is a very confusing chart.,whatâ€™s +25%?,the a770 vs 3060 overall?,"hardly, even intel shows a deficit in most games there.",so is it specifically the game below the arrow?,meaning the scores of 47 vs 45?,not mathematically that isnâ€™t.,so is it then referring to the â€œnew beta driverâ€ as being +25%?,versus what?,"is the 47 with the 25%, or is it 25% on top of the 47?",and why do i have to do the math either way?,and only any improvement for that one title out of all those games?,"anyways, itâ€™s good news that driver updates are significantly increasing performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hard to judge these significant increases in performance without actually getting any product out.,wish they would work on that also,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
watched the video.,"the 25% is a different point that is made about a driver update increasing performance by 25% for that particular game, implying there are big gains to be had in some games.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

these upgrade posts always confuse me a little when the hardware that's being upgraded is still perfectly good.,i went from a 4690k to a 3800x and i have no plans on upgrading in the next couple of years at least.,"not that i can't afford it, but swapping hardware is too much of a pain for a benefit that i may not see with current gpus at all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same.,iâ€™m going to milk it for another two generations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
me too :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
especially if you're gaming at 1440p +.,9900k will still last.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the kf is baller.,that dead silicon inside acts as a heatsink and allows better oc.,"iâ€™m running 5.2ghz on a 280mm radiator, 4.7ghz cache and 4266mhz ddr4.",itâ€™s smoking fast.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
had my 9900k since 2018 and honestly its showing its age atm.i play at  1440p 144+ fps and it can show its age in certain cpu heavy games like wh3/cyberpunk and any cpu heavy games really.,i've heard of ppl switching  from 9900k>12900k for cyberpunk and they noticed less stutters overall from the switch.games are just getting huge these days.especially if you play on a 144hz monitor which requires a beefy cpu to keep 1%s up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"great is a big stretch, even a $100 quadcore i3-12100f outperforms a 9900k in gaming, and isn't too far off in multithreaded performance.",and the i3-12100 will be replaced in a month.,"as someone that previously had a 9700k, 9th gen definitely is showing its age.","i wouldn't pair it with a new upper class gpu, or use it for 1080p gaming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it depends.. it looks nice but still both processors are way too hot :) 12900ks is a mess actually, i didn't expect those 80+ temps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm not a fan of rgb of any kinds.,it's childish imo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is how it should be.,it works fine for 6-8 years.,some people treat pc building as a hobby and they build it every year or every two years and that's fine for them but that shouldn't be a standard practice.,( my personal opinion ),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

for real.,i keep looking to upgrade to an 11th gen i7 but i'm currently running a 10th gen i5 and i can't justify the price.,figured i'll just stick with the 10600kf for a whiiiiile.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
always kind of funny seeing posts and/or comments like these.,"""i finally upgraded after three years..."" and of course it was upgrading over a platform that's new or relevant for that time.",i just went from a 4770k to a 12600k myself.,eight years of use as my primary and it just became my backup/travel pc.,like you i fully intend to use the 12600k for 6+ years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's why 12 series is on sale.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
true but op still gets to enjoy it today,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it think there will be little difference like it was between 10 to 11 series.,clean and nice setup btw.,":)

p.s: watch out to fully plug in the pci cable to gpu, one of 6+2 pin isn't fully plugged in.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
agreed.,op totally wasted his money when a 13900k is launching very soon.,he already had a 9900k so could certainly afford to wait a month.,how impatient can he be?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
crazy hot mess even on 360 aio.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fractal design flex b-20.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bench-wise the difference is humongous.,but for gaming it's enough 9900k for sure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
<3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not really, the 9900k is valued at like $300.",i'd be surprised if you could do anything more than browse google on a $300 laptop.,"or if you want to go for original retail, still $550 is a stretch for a gaming laptop.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"auto oc is a bloody joke, true.",my 9900k was delidded and even being on 360 ekwb aio it was hot as well.,"no way i can delid 12900ks, it's way too risky.",derbauer killed his 12900k :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
anyone got a thread for me to oc?,9900k with auros ultra gaming motherboard?,z390 i think?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my happiness is immeasurable and my day is made :) gotta research that bios that three times more complicated than the old one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
may i ask why you're doing this upgrade when the 13900k is probably coming out in a month?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i upgraded from 6500 to 12900ks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it can,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's waaay cooler.,i sustain 5200mhz with 75c+- in cinebench unlike **delidded** 9900k that was 80+ hotter.,"the thing is my 12900ks vcore is 1.22v on 5200mhz, 9900k - 1.315v 5000mhz.",the difference is obvious.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 wanted to learn something new :) my buddy bought my old build in advance for a good price and i decided to go for the new one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"nah, no need to wait forever.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i know intel's changed since the days of 10th and 11th gen but i seriously doubt a noticable performance difference between a 12900k and a 13900k.,9th to 12th is a major difference but it's practically the same difference that can be seen from 11th to 12th.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ek, bruh /flex",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no need to wait forever :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's even good for 4k.,depends on your gpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
correct.,the above thing is a remote for the mobo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"they can do whatever they want with their money, plus, 12900ks shits all over the 9900k whether you want to believe it or not",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had to upgrade to 12th gen as my i5 660k was for sure showing itâ€™s age ðÿ˜¬ loves that little workhorse,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think the 9900k was easily the best gaming cpu in the past 5-7 years.,"i have a 7700k and it is about to reach its limits now (hence in-line for an upgrade), though i'm still mostly gpu limited (3080 vr).",a 9900k will easily last years before feeling obsolete.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
im rocking a 8400,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i know.,i just want an excuse at this point to upgrade my 9900kf.,it's perfect still for how i use it but i just want to buy and build a pc with the new cpus coming out.,"hi, i'm a recovering build-a-holic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm still on a 4790k lmao,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8700k @5ghz upgrading soon though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bro 8700k at 5ghz crying in the back,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 9700k was great!,i used one for a few months but found it not to be enough of an upgrade over my 5ghz 2600k so i sold it for msrp and got a 9900kf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why did you upgrade then?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep same.,2025 at best.,"i've never, in any game topped out the cpu.",and work is all migrated to gpu these days,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have a 9900k and iâ€™m trying to think when i should upgrade, maybe 4 years from now?",it does get really hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"take a look into lga1700 socket/die bending, it's really a mess.","there are bending correction plates for cheap, should help but also could void warranties as it replaces the socket clamping mechanism.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the pc i built for my son is running a 9900k oc'd to 5ghz (1.32v) stable ambient temps of 20\~24c and being cooled by an h100i xt using ll120 fans as push config (front mounted 4000d) barely broke 70c in non-real world stress tests... during gaming it averages between 50's\~low 60's.,my daughter's build runs a similar setup but a 9700k also overclocked runs similar temps with an h100i xt with the same fans.,"i believe your motherboard might be the culprit of your temps, normally msi doesn't go nuts in auto oc'ing...

i wish they had the unify-x version on the z490 board.,very badass.,i don't like rgb board that is turned off because their light-ed areas are translucent.,the unify is just pure badassery.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what case is that looks so sleek.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yup, literal waste of energy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah on my next build i'm definitely planning to cut back on rgb bigtime,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nopes.,aio at the top is the way to go imo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no sense in upgrading a cpu every three years but i guess some people have more money than sense.,"gpus are a different story, i usually buy every generation haha",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"actually, no.",13700k has same core count as 12900k and likely have higher clocks.,that didn't happen between 10 and 11 where actually core count decreased from 10900k to 11900k.,13900k will be one tier higher than 12900k.,13700k will beat 12900k and so on.,so i wouldn't buy a 12900k at this point.,better to buy a 13700k in few months.,"i am not talking about gaming benchmarks fyi (not just), but overall perf across the board.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

mine gets hot too and i have the corsair h150 on it.,upgrading is up to you when you feel like your cpu is holding you back.,before the i9 i was on an i5 3570k.,"so about six generations, but i didnâ€™t have a high paying job as i do now.",iâ€™ll see what 14th gen brings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

well it depends.,"if you're doing cpu intensive tasks, an upgrade every couple years usually is quite noticable.",not everyone is using their pc just for gaming.,people have different workloads.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah itll he worth the wait for 13th gen as itll be the second iteration of the new p & e cores design!,until then maybe look into overclocking?,i think the 6600k would benefit from it considering the gpu you have.,"i made my 3570k last 9 years with a 4.5 ghz oc before upgrading, gave the old system to my brother and that little 3rd gen i5 is still gaming today!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you never should have spent that kind of money on a 3080 when your cpu was only a 6600kâ€¦.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i know this is intel sub reddit but have you looked into zen 4 with 3d v-cache?,they're supposed to launch early next year.,3d v-cache does wonders for gaming.,i'm considering upgrading my 9700k when the zen 4 3d v-cache launches.,i play a lot of tarkov and 3d v-cache boosts frames by a lot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what temps is hot for a cpu?,i run all kinds of high processing power apps and games and never go above like 54?,or around there maybe little lower or higher if i can remember.,i have the noctua nh-d15 cooler and itâ€™s verrrrry cool.,54 might be high though.,idk anyways mines never been hot try my cooler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am using my i5 3570k with 16gb ram as my proxmox server.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've got a 9900k and 3080ti which feel great.,"an upgrade only looks like a 3% fps gain, does it feel more smooth or is there more gains than that?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wow, that is shocking.",you got the frame and a decent 360 aio and its still cooking away at 80c?!,"intel have to really get their shit together for 13th gen, thats bananas hot.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ok, i was just implicating.","elsewhere you wrote about a higher than needed vcore, have you tuned that and received better results?","should definitely work good, have fun.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you are probably correct, speaking paranoid i could think the original screws for the clamping mechanism could have a detectable force or some glue inside which could be tamper-detected.","but yes, where should intel get the information about mainboard modifications..
one thing i always hated about lga sockets is that it straight away leaves those two marks on the cpu, where the noses clamp down on the left and right...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yep, i ran into that issue with my asus board and the 10900k oc... a lot of days of tweaking to get it just right lol.",9700k & 9900k still viable till this day.,love those two pc's!,":) and even better, they're happy with their pc's!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your motherboard might be auto overclocking it with high voltage.,also (can happen) reseat the cooler apply thermal paste.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
air bubbles if any will not interfere with the liquid flow as much.,"if you mount as op, you will hear occasional gurgling sounds (since air bubbles would be near the tube's opening); although this wouldn't kill the aio.",mount at the top and you're gold.,"also, many manufacturers recommend mounting aios at the top in their instruction leaflet, if possible.","if not, mount with tubes bottom; with the radiator being the highest part in the loop.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your aio is mounted just fine.,"as long as the pump is not the highest point in your setup, you're fine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no way, really?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if that 18% means that much for you, sure why not.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
was about to thumbs up until that last part about  30fps...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"by the way, that wasnâ€™t me that downvoted you, but i respectfully disagree.",the price to upgrade from a 9900k to a 12900k to get 18% performance doesnâ€™t make much sense financially or performance wise.,itâ€™s like getting a toyota avalon when you have a camry that is 3 years old.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
correct iâ€™m just saying the real world difference between the 9900k and the 12900k is 18%.,"so he bought a new board, new ram and new chip for 18%.",i hardly think thatâ€™s worth it in terms of a worthy upgrade for the cost.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have been on both subs for years.,and intel sub mostly acknowledges amd as a good competition and nothing bad.,just because i didn't mention amd doesn't mean anyone here means it isn't a good option.,"i didn't mention amd because op already bought the system, and the person replying to was comparing intel cpus only.",so amd is irrelevant in this thread.,"it's your opinion that buying rpl doesn't make sense but considering most people upgrade 3-4 year cycle anyway, at which point - any upgrade would need newer mobo, so that's moot.",that's my opinion anyway.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"by that logic, he didn't need ti upgrade anyway.",that's why i said not just gaming.,my point simply is that 10-11th gen is not same as 12th- 13th,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i had a similar issue with my 12900k, thermalright, new cooler and bla bla bla, the manual voltage was the biggest difference.",1.290v and stable 5.1 oc and now no more than 80c on stress test and 50c on gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"check your llc, thatâ€™s probably why itâ€™s hitting that high.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can undervolt these pretty well.,mine is at 1.226v under 100% load.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why are you using auto vcore?,the first thing i would do with a 12900ks is to lower it as much as possible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same.,"i just bought the ks and am trying to decide if i should keep it or swap it for the k, since it runs cooler.","i could wait for gen13, but this i9 is already going to be overkill for my needs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well i play at 4k so it is still a really great experience.,"i know it could be better, but it is still amazing.",the only games iâ€™ve had trouble on are like assassins creed and battlefield could be better.,every other game seems smooth to me.,"just got done playing spiderman with no issues

the reason they are so out of wack is because i originally had a 1080 with the 6600k.",i upgraded to a 1080 ti and then the 3080. with the way the gpu market has been i have used each card for two years and then was able to sell my old one and upgrade for only $200 or less each time.,it was basically a free upgrade.,whereas upgrading my cpu i might as well build a new pc at that point,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
home computing is an evolution.,upgrading part by part when funds become available.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i bought a 3080 12gb with my 8600k knowing very well i would be cpu bottleneckedâ€¦but it still gave me a massive performance jump when not cpu bottlenecks

and besides, its only until 13th gen comes out and its paired with a 13700k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"without knowing his use case, that is a silly assumption.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, i was just making a point about the 9900k not being so old :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and its probably gonna be a year before i properly upgrade to something like a 13600k... i wanna get a 4790k before october but i don't think i will,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1% lows are greatly improved.,the games i play are mostly cpu bound.,e.g.,escape from tarkov.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on the workload.,80c in prime95 ftt is actually decent.,it's important to consider the impact of thermal density in these baseline temperatures.,at some point both air and liquid coolers aren't constrainted by wattage (bigger coolers can dump the heat from higher wattages) but by thermal density.,think of it like this - even an infinitely large and efficient cooler won't cool to temperatures below ambient temperature as long as you're using ambient air to cool the radiator fins.,so an utopian perfect cooler has its contact copper permanently at ambient temperature.,"you can simply calculate the maximum heat transfer between the cpu and the contact pad, and this is where the bottleneck lies nowadays.","with insanely small cpu's you get very high thermal density, and the only way to increase heat transfer when you're limited by surface area and thermal density can't be blowing more air through your radiator fins, equilibrium must be reached by achieving a higher temperature differential between the ther pad and the cpu.",aka higher cpu temperature.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, definitely.","but still it's too hot, absolutely no surprise.",cinebench 90c.,still playing with vcore.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you don't mind me asking what settings did you have to change to get the temps down?,i have an asus motherboard and it's pushing my cpu voltage to be 1.4v idle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks i'll try to reseat it with fresh paste.,how do i check for the auto overclock?,i have an asus mobo?,is it the ai overclock tuner thing?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you better watch [my research post](https://www.reddit.com/r/overclocking/comments/vrx7wy/front_and_top_radiator_placement_part_3_final/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) why the front is better in terms of cooling.,and no way the aio could be killed that way.,been using this configuration for 10 years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"also went from a gt730 to 1060 3gb, to 1070, to 1080ti, to 3080ti.",typing this out seems funny.,"iâ€™m a capitalist, stimulating the economy is good.",ðÿ˜‚,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if the 9900k was holding him back and upgrading doesn't financialy hurt him, why not?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most people riding the latest trends just resell parts to upgrade.,itâ€™s really not that hard.,"i went from an i5-2400 to i5-7500, to an i7-7700k, then i9-9900k, i9-12900k, to a i9-12900ks.",living near a micro center and knowing how to sell on ebay helps minimize losses.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"downvotes donâ€™t concern me, so itâ€™s all good.",not looking for anyones validation.,"again, you seem to be projecting your idea of â€œsenseâ€ onto others.",it doesnâ€™t make sense for you.,fine.,but you shouldnâ€™t presume to tell others what makes sense for them to do with their money.,"iâ€™ve known people who traded vehicles every 1 or 2 years, and iâ€™ve done so a few times at 3 years, until i landed on something i drove for 20 years.","i just lost interest in buying a new car, but it had nothing to do with â€œmaking sense.â€ itâ€™s what they/i chose to do.",it made sense to us if for nothing else than to satisfy a want or desire.,people with the income for discretionary spending like that donâ€™t have to live and spend like someone in poverty.,unless of course they choose to be that frugal (which doesnâ€™t â€œmake senseâ€ to me â€” see how that sounds?).,"i get it that you canâ€™t relate, or just have different priorities in life.",thatâ€™s cool.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"sounds much, but ok, depending on your use case it should not exceed that level.","my 8700k@5000mhz@1.35v runs to about 85â°c in prime95, normal use of gaming never reaches that.",i can feel the enthusiasm and you surely will find a good level.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, go into your bios and see if the ai is running rampant auto oc'ing your processor.",usually to achieve high boost clocks it would need higher voltage depending on the quality of the chip.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea i did mention that it wouldn't kill the aio.,but are the gurgling sounds not audible ?,>been using this configuration for 10 years.,is that the very same aio that you have been running for the past 10 years in that very same configuration?,my guess is no.,"also the reduction in efficiency of the aio would not be apparent immediately, but would definitely impact the lifespan down the line.","also, typically, you wouldn't want air to be pulled from outside of a radiator into the case.","i understand that your cpu will run cooler, but it would result in feeding warmer air to other components with gpu being most sensitive to temps.",i would always do aio rad exhausts unless i can somehow fit relatively more intakes in the case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

big agree here.,asus is real bad about this with their auto-oc tech.,temperatures are typically an afterthought.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
570/580 8gb is the best option for the extra vram.,960 is much weaker than all of them so i wouldn't consider it.,1650 is the newest but it's slower than a 580 and will probably cost you the most.,970 is a good alternative if you want something a bit cheaper.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rx 580 for sure and try to get the 8gb model.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think it is better posted in r/buildapc.,"still, as someone indicated, rx 570 & rx 580 8 gb models would be best but don't forget they are still a bit old.","if your budget allows, check in this order to see if you can get something like this.",rx 6600 > rx5600xt >  gtx 1650 super > rx 5500xt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how is this remotely intel related?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bro this is r/intel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
get intel arc.,at least its something that has anything to do with intel.,"also, the people who advice you things literally canâ€™t, cause they have no idea what ur putting it in to hardware wise and what you plan on doing with it.",i assume gaming but since you dont mention this (nor bother explaining where you are posting this here apparently) thereâ€™s literally no way to provide advice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rx580 is better than any of the other cards.,"get that or an rx5500xt, which is newer and even faster, based on rdna and is more power efficient iirc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rx 570 and rx 580 provide more performance than the other nvidia graphics cards.,"however, the gtx 1650 costs much less than rx 570 and rx 580 on newegg.",so i would go for the gtx 1650 if your on a buget.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you i would highly consider it â˜ºï¸,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah it's basically 960/1050/1630, 1050ti, 1650, 570/970, 580/1060, 1650s in that order performance wise.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this can be considered relevant .,tho i made some questions to consider what is best for the my upgrade and what gpu would fit also on my budget .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

have you verified your power options settings?,"if it's set to ""high performance"", that's what happens.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is it causing temps to run too high?,or using too much power (wattage) than you'd prefer?,i typically run my pcs at max clock speed (when not oc'd) since they're usually plugged in and power draw/temps aren't an issue.,but i understand some people like to undervolt and occasionally set a lower base/boost frequency to have better temps & lower overall power consumption.,"the only device i'd say i have configured differently is my laptop, but only for when it's on battery power.",in that scenario i prefer longevity vs performance since it wouldn't last long at all if i did any gaming while not plugged in lol.,"so the i5-7300hq it has will run at like 1.8-2.6ghz vs 3.5ghz (single core peak) or 3.1ghz (all-core peak) when using battery only, but i had to mess with the individual settings for the power plan instead of just using their defaults",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you cannot be fully commited to two things.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so a largely failed project so far will continue to drag the company down into the foreseeable future.,fun news.,that intel thought they could just jump into the ring with nvidia and amd and put out a comparable product in a relatively short amount of time is peak intel hubris.,i fail to see a pathway where they will be able to catch up to the others realistically in the consumer space.,*maybe* in the data center if they focus more on fpga based boards of some sort that can be customized to accelerate specific workloads.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

good.,they can't expect to break into a saturated market and hit the ground running.,"it will take them a few years to get everything dialed in, but it will be well worth it in the long run.","the graphics market is pretty lucrative, so it's well worth the investment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i mean, if they pull out now then their entire stock won't get sold as no one wants to buy into a platform that is being discontinued.",if intel kill it they'll fire whatever driver team they have working on it and forward support will be trash (or at the very least people will feel that way).,even if they've privately decided to kill the project the only thing they'd do publicly is say they are going forward to hopefully save billions in inventory write offs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that was a bullshit leak.,pat gelsinger has always stated his commitment to discrete graphics.,"from what iâ€™ve seenâ€¦ many of the leaks that you see from intel that donâ€™t have hard benchmarks to go with it are usually wrong, but intel doesnâ€™t talk about rumors so the general population is never corrected.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a350m, a370m and a380 are all available.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's likely going to be a really expensive card for the purpose.,workstation cards have a nice premium to them because of the drivers optimized for specific workloads.,"you should just get the same exact gpu in the a380 if it's just for media transcoding, probably will cost 2 to 3 times less.",unless that's a premium you're willing to pay for the form factor and it's not available elsewhere.,msi seems to have a low profile a380 card though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"man, you and me both!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
care to explain why?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel did not think they could compete right away.,the whole point was to ramp up.,get processes and engineers in place for hw and sw. get the teams and everything all setup and have some products to deliver which set deadlines.,they don't expect to really have a competitive high end gpu until like 2027,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah your right, intel should give up the entire prospect of developing and improving on what theyâ€™ve got, and just leave us with a duopoly indefinitely /s

is it?,you have to consider that the amount of transistors & die sizes on the new cards has skyrocketed from 10+ years ago.,"all things considered, the cost has not really gone up much at all especially when you add inflation to the equation.",gtx 680 for example only had $100 lower msrp than the rtx 3080.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

geekbench isnt very good metric for desktop with sustained high performance.,nobody really uses it (until now by amd) for desktop processors.,ryzen processors historically don't maintain boost clock very long.,thats why cinebench single thread is commonly used because it's a long task.,so that one is what you want to look for and more representative of desktop usage (for single core).,"i am not saying zen4 boost will be bad, i actually i think it will be the best yet but it has to be tested.",on an unrelated note.,i know all the tech tubers like to dunk on intel nowadays and they are more impressed by amd cpus that arguably use more cutting edge fabrication technology and that's perfectly reasonable stance to have.,but i feel like it's been underrated how much intel is getting out of their chips in the end and they have been coming with some innovative engineering to get there.,i feel like these works will pay off when/if they get their fab business up to par.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'm puzzled as to why so many people in the amd slide post think that the 13900k is going to have some sort of significant advantage over the 7950x considering the fact that geekbench is damn near the best case scenario for intel(see adl vs zen3).,i think pricing alone indicates amd thinks the competition will be close assuming intel raises msrp's by 20% as both flagship chips will come in at around $700.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel as usual will have the slight advantage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

your hope is probably an ultra long shot at this point.,"amd is launching first, with a better platform this time around.",am5 is going to last at least until 2024. amd is going to milk ðÿ¼ every early adopter that needs pci-5 without halving the pci-e lanes for the gpu.,intel 12th gen looks like a go to budget power house however.,"argh, intel, please shape up, we need you to be competitive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"itâ€™d be out of character for intel, the 13900k will almost certainly be around $600.","the real danger for amd is the 13400 (which will be fully competitive with the 7600x), the 13600k (which should beat the 7700x across the board) and the 13700k (which will probably beat the 7900x across the board).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if they release better cpu in multithread and better ipc as the leak, at $600, it will force amd to cut prices, so that's a win, but also will make amd lose sales majorly, as some people don't care if 13900k has e-cores.","for rendering, i am almost certain 13900k will take the cake.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you really think raptor will be that good?,i hope so but not sure anymore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think amd honestly don't care about the 13400 or the budget segment.,yes it is the budget king but amd's zen is posturing as if it's a premium brand now.,amd drew first blood so they can hammer raptor lake with an x3d refresh which intel doesn't have an answer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no way that's happening.,look at the single thread scores.,the 7600x outperforms the 12900k which is most important for gamers.,and no way the 13400 is gonna compete with a a12900k and this from historical comparisons.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the k sku is better for the consumer.,"it allows chips that has the correct number of functional cores, but canâ€™t hit as high of frequency as the k sku to be sold as a non- k sku.",otherwise those chips would have to be sold as a k-sku as the tier below with more cores locked.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"good points, very insightful.","and you could be right, if intel is desperate enough they could do that.","they'd also remove the few remaining reasons for gamers to get a highend intel chip like the 12900/13900k though, and that is going to lose them a lot of money, and last quarter was the first one in 30 years where intel lost money so pat might not get away with it.",they need to keep their asps high.,it would be awesome though.,bring back some real competition and force amd to put out a 7600 or lower the price of 7600x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel works harder at protecting enterprise and other family sku's than about any company around.,they work so hard at it that i think it cost them market share.,"while amd will introduce a few sku's, intel has a family of, how many?","generally the consumer only really hears of a few, but consider the power variations, chip packages, marketing packages, and so on.","by the time a consumer gets a product from intel, its a wonder any new features are in it.","for me, marketing is the problem for intel.",less market segmentation means more for the consumer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but you see...you think like a humanitarian.,intel thinks like a business.,"they will continue to make non-k chips, as it allows a bunch of dells and hp computers to be with those non-k chips.",as far as that goes...it won't change.,"many people don't care about overclocking, they will buy a non-k chip, to save 50-100 bucks.",intel will never do this.,"the fight is not just against amd, it's also investors' expectations to be met, and that means quota of sales, and amount of chips for different purposes.","we had i5-2600 non-k in my work at discover card, when we upgraded, and it performed wonderfully.",we had over 4 thousand cubicles of computers that got upgraded from older gen intel.,this was 2012. imagine the profit intel got?,i think it was dell computer as well.,"they don't care about crushing amd, as much as they care about making money in different markets.",not just overclockers and gamers.,"most money comes from servers and office set ups, as companies buy systems by thousands.","especially places like discover card, and yes, i am sure their servers got upgraded to, from ghetto servers that kept going down all the time when i was there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
january 5th @ces according to greymon.,"they'll have 12 and 16 core versions this time too, and they should be clocked as high as the standard cpus, not a bit lower like the 5800x3d.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
theyâ€™re going to probably launch another 8 core v cache part and thatâ€™s it.,it doesnâ€™t seem like theyâ€™ll release a 16 core v cache chip because it would simply be too powerful and would eat into their epyc and threadripper sales,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
possibly.,"i don't get why people think the 13900k is going to beat the 7950x, let alone by a large margin.",there's another thread farther up showing the two damn near neck and neck in geekbench with a slight edge to the 7950x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably.,there is no reason it wouldnâ€™t.,amd is again on a superior production process so they can pack a lot more transistors to the small area and get them to run at lower power.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most likely because of stockpiling vcache chiplets for epyc puts a crimp in supply for ryzen3d.,"once they get enough that they cant comfortably put in an epyc package, they can bin accordingly for a future ""better zen 4"" while giving vanilla zen 4 a chance to be on market for a while.","my theory is that it also helps the vcache parts have better launch supply as well, buuuuut it will all do with how much of a beating zen 4 takes from raptor lake because it's looking good.","if it's bad they might paper launch a vcache part asap to gain ground at least in gaming, maybe?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i was debating on it during that time, just didn't put it in writing, and now i can confidently say: it's worth the wait to see how it will be.","95c chip in phoenix, az, with summers as hot as 120f degrees (49 c) is not making me so open minded about buying 7950x for now.","i wanna see more workarounds to reduce temps, and see how it goes.","if i can lower temps on 7950x3d and still get better performance on this chip than 7950x, i will buy it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i have a 9900k and i'm very tempted.,however i think its a want more than a need at this stage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
makes sense.,the 9900k is a top of the line cpu.,you could probably squeeze 3 or 4 cpu generations of cpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wait a year.,14th gen vs zen 4+ or 5 will be an absolutely massive upgrade which will make the 9900k look like an i3 in comparison.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm pretty much you...

9900k and prob will go 7900 or 7950 for first time ever frankly..still nvidia though haha",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i hate an idea of e-cores, but proper implementation of e-cores may get better.currently i see stutters in some people's experiences.architecture is not fully developed, to have e-cores and p-cores speak fluently.it's such a huge disappointment to see intel do 8 p-cores and then 16 e-cores on 13900k, not even 12 p-cores, kind of makes me mad now.","i almost bought 7950x, until i saw 95c as a new thermal criteria.",i suggest watching those videos.,temps stay pinned at 95c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is one reason and that is newer pcie for storage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, i agree.","that should land around jan 23. according to leaks

"switch to amd, ddr5 price gonna drop next year",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wait a bit, don't rush.","let intel drop 13900k, and you can see them scramble for market, while they drop prices on things such as 13900k.","potentially resulting in pricing of 13700k to be equal now to 13900k, and 13700k being below 13900k.",wait.,:-),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why?,i think it depends on how often a person upgrades their system.,maybe gen 1's 7 cpu gets beaten by gen 2's 5 cpu but i'd argue that the people who upgrade every generation are a small minority..... maybe even those who upgrade every 2 generations.,"if not upgrading often, it makes sense to get the best your budget allows and work/play makes use of.",so what if a 9 gets beaten by a 7 18 months later?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think the answer depends on your needs.,i alt+tab from the game to youtube all day.,"i play r6 siege or insurgency, and i watch videos between spawns/matches when i get killed.",more cores = more flawless experience.,"bro, you can't imagine how horrible it was on i7-4790k alt+tabbing back and forth.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, yes i do.","with core count increases across the board, intel doesnâ€™t even *need* ipc or clocks to compete, and theyâ€™ll have minor increases in both of those areas.","the 13400 will basically be a 12600k, the 13600k, now a 6+8-core chip, has been spotted hitting 24000 (!)","in r23 multicore, which is about 85-90% of a 5950x, and the 13700k will be a 12900k with minor ipc and clock bumps.","thanks to alder lakeâ€™s existing single-core edge, i think thatâ€™s more than enough to compete with zen 4 in single-core and demolish it in multicore.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i saw benchmarks in geekbench above and i can confidently say: yes  
though i am sure in something 7950x will be better than 13900k  
some games are better optimized for amd chips for an example.","i expect 13900k win against 7950x, then amd drops x3d larger cache version, and intel will try to win with 13900ks (binned version of 13900ks)

it willâ€¦ but it will produce lots of heat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel will release meteor lake after 3d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s the key word: *posturing*.,"zen 4 isnâ€™t actually better than even alder lake overall, at least at its launch pricing, and iâ€™m frankly pretty sick and tired of a company whoâ€™s given us some of the best cpus ever made as of late deciding theyâ€™re only going to make spiritual successors to the i7-8700k from now on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"benefit of x3d varies wildly from game-to-game

zen 4 has larger l2, so it would *probably* be more immune to l3 and need even larger x3d cache to achieve a similar level of benefit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
historical comparisons to what exactly?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this happens *every* generation that features a significant ipc increase.,"the ryzen 3 3100 outperforms the ryzen 7 2700x in single-threading, to state just one of many examples.","the 13400 can *absolutely* compete with the 12900k in single-threading, all it needs is a modest ipc increase and/or clock bump.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel can keep the k series if they want, just allow overclocking on all sku's which'll help remain competitive with amd at the lower price points, with amd leaving the lower end of the market open intel could really hit them in this area, especially if intel can get their gpu department working.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah my thoughts is amd wins the performance crown for a month, intel regains with the 13th gen then amd claps back with the vcache chips.",either way gonna be fun to see the results!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
epyc and threadripper are different beasts for different workloads.,"the huge l3 cache of the 5800x3d has a huge advantage in gaming (especially in games like flight simulator), but otherwise itâ€™s way behind epyc and threadripper in performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"looks like 7950x3d will come out, now that i saw several leaks on it.",should be interesting.,"perhaps i will buy that, and lower the wattage on that chip, and still get better performance than 7950x non-3d version.",either that or upgrade to 13900k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why would they eat into epyc and threadripper sales?,"vcache is for gaming, no one is buying epyc and tr for gaming...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they already announced 7900x/7950x vcache variants are comingâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the problem is that itâ€™s geekbench.,"thatâ€™s a very short term benchmark and doesnâ€™t tell us about sustained boost times, etc.",i think both chips are going to win different workloads.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all the zen3d desktop parts are rejects from epyc as epyc is the best zen has to offer for ppw and the ryzen parts can leak power like crazy and it is fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just refuse to get a new platform until ddr5 is better and cheaper.,probably 14th gen for me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"always a want, but my motherboard is dying right now.","so it decides that my 5.0ghz can go down to 4.8 ghz here, or 4.7 in another game, i am so tired of that shi...lol...i am living with it.","i noticed that my rtx 3070 is too powerful for 9900k, and games are running at 87% gpu utilization even on ultra settings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

only when using it at 100%.,how often does the average person max out their cpu usage for long periods of time outside of running a benchmark or testing for stability?,it's not like the cpu is constantly going to drink 200 plus watts of power as soon as you power the system on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
zen 4 produces similar amount of heat and its a lot difficult to cool.,raptor lake is easier to cool because of the bigger monolithic die.,zen 4 ccx's are like the surface of sun.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"unless the leaks got it all wrong, the 13400 is literally a rebadged 12600k but with lower clocks.",i have no doubt it will be the budget king but let's not kid ourselves here.,it won't have faster st than 12400 outside of maybe a 100mhz bump in clocks and the bump in cache.,it will compete against a 12900k in mt in the same way a 12600k does but that's it.,"that and price, obviously.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that wouldnâ€™t make sense though- theyâ€™d have to limit chips below their capability to do that and higher end chips would be more expensive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"once again, the point of non-k is cost reduction, or at the very least justification of the premium price of k chip.",they segment the market for different businesses.,"i wouldn't change it, if i was intel.",you will lose money in the end.,"most business still go intel, over amd.","i mean really big companies still rock intel, as they bought from them for over 20 years.","relationships are good, and support is there, for major businesses.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, i doubt if intel is regaining with 13th gen though.",we know that 7600x is 5% faster than 12900k on average.,"and the 7950x will have faster st performance (2175 vs 2275 due to 7950 being clocked @ 5,7ghz vs 5,3ghz).",so the 7950x should offer about 8% better gaming performance than a 12900k.,but the latest leaks of raptor lakes (13900k) gaming performance indicate between 3 and 11% performance improvement in gaming over 12900k.,if that is correct it should be an average of 7% better.,"over all i think it's going to be too close to call and within the proverbial margin of error, so other factors should decide, like price, power usage, cooling needed, expected socket lifespan etc...

when the 7800/7900/7950x3d's arrive though...they're going to be game changers.","intel needs to counter them somehow, like a raptor lake refresh, but i don't see how.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

they use the same ccds",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no v cache is actually used primarily for data center chips like epyc and workstation child like threadripperâ€¦ larger caches in general speed things up tremendously, especially when a workload fits in said cache.",amd was selling v cache epyc for months before they released it to consumer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but didn't we use to praise geekbench when it gave alder lake better scores than zen 3?,why does it suck more now?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah pretty much this.,ddr5 will get cheaper and much faster still.,if you maintain a gpu bottleneck with 1440p+ were talking barely double digit differences in a lot of titles between a 9700k and a 12700k for example.,itâ€™s not like the old days.,"iâ€™m into building retro systems, among my xp stuff iâ€™ve got an athlon 64 4400+ and a c2q 9650 @4ghz.","just a 2 year gap between those cpus but the c2q absolutely demolishes the athlon, itâ€™s very noticeable in games",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think that's because 4.7ghz is the all core boost speed, 5.0ghz is for only 1 or 2 cores, unless you override it with an overclock.","yeah there are some games where my 2070 super and dlss only has 80-93% usage, it's strange.","it's still fast enough for my code compiles and fpga synthesis so my wallet is safe for maybe a few more years, especially with motherboard prices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
correct but itâ€™s only like 20-30%.,9900k is already a beast.,"also, being the first gen of am5 there are bound to be some issues + 2nd gen chipsets of amd sockets are much better and more long lasting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"oh, wow!","didn't realize they are keeping ddr4 as an option, so we will see both ddr4 and ddr5 motherboards for you to choose from.","you can also wait for massive price drops after 13900k drops, and buy 12900k for like 400 bucks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i thought zen 4 would have trouble competing with raptor lake in the midrange even if it was sanely priced.,"now that i know itâ€™s not sanely priced, iâ€™m expecting raptor lake to be the better buy up and down the stack.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"overclocking is all about pushing it past the specifications laid down by the manufacture, some can't overclock at all others can go far it's down to the user to figure how far they can go with it being stable enough for their own use.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i donâ€™t trust amds first party benchmarks, regardless these are exciting times for cpus!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they are.,"just because you use the same bricks for an office and residential building doesn't  
 make them the same.","64 instead of 8 cores don't really make a performance difference in flight simulator, as msfs doesn't use more than 6 cores.",but l3 cache does.,"so using a 64 core threadripper for msfs will result in one core being hammered, 5 others are doing a bit of work and 59 cores are just idling.","if you look at app benchmarks, the 5800x3d  often lags behind the 5800x.",v-cache isnt't a threat to epyc and threadrippper.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's always sucked compared to other benchmarks.,most third party reviewers comment on it like gamers nexus all the time.,it's a well established fact.,it favors short term burst workloads and simulates more of a javascript like workload.,everyone favors different benchmarks that align more with their own workloads.,"for me, i'll wait until i can see passmark scores plus phoronix compiler and lzma benchmarks.",that aligns with my workload the best.,"gaming is a secondary concern for me, although it does matter some.",this isn't a fanboy situation.,i've got a mix of amd and intel hardware including a 3950x and 11900k desktop and some other systems from both vendors.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well ive been itching to upgrade this new gen coming out but i might just wait for the vcache amd cpus.intel are running way too hot now and 12th gen has issues such as bending in the socket which i doubt 13th gen will solve.,also spiderman remastered really massacred the 9900k its not even funny.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"amd's presentation slides say zen 4/4c, zen 4 3d, then zen 5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"where i live the drops on older cpus are not significant, better to buy the new one.","yeah, ddr4 is a neat option!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"normally you should always be sceptical with first part benchmarks, but lisa su has a pretty good track record of presenting accurate, fair performance numbers.","with zen 3 she claimed a 19% average ipc uplift, the reviews backed that number up.","i think she knows their customers are intelligent enough to see through any attempt at bullshit, we have many good tech journalists that she knows is gonna call her out at the slightest bit of it, like linus, gamers nexus and hub.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"epyc and threadripper use ccd+io die just like ryzen

epyc/threadripper dont have fpga or ai or graphics or whatever chiplets

ryzen would eat into sales of epyc/threadripper because ryzen and epyc use same ccd and every ccd used for ryzen is 1 ccd not used for epyc.",this becomes a big problem when you have more demand than supply for epyc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, wait.",i am waiting now too.,also 95c in 7950x...unless you do watt workaround.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah correct.,zen 5 may have more cores.,definitely worth the wait for more mature motherboards as well.,why buy twice?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
amd under lisa su tried to strongarm reviewers into only doing 4k benchmarks of ryzen 1 & 2 because it could not compete with intel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"again, this doesnâ€™t matter.",the cpus are targeted for different use cases and they arenâ€™t substitutes.,"if there is a supply shortage, amd would of course try to deliver the most profitable cpus.",but thatâ€™s a completely other topic.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well i want the 8 core or even the 6 core since i care mostly about gaming.,almost lost patience but these motherboard prices helped me not buy anything yet.,"also why do most motherboard only have 4 sata ports now?i guess they are pushing you to get more m.2 drives  


the whole 95c thing isnt great but its auto boosting as much as it can and even the 7950x ""only"" uses 200 watts so the less core skus should be using less",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>the cpus are targeted for different use cases and they arenâ€™t substitutes.,"that way even ryzen pro [or intel vpro] would be """"different"""" from the non-pro [or non-vpro] ones",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they are, even if the difference is just tiny.",but the difference between v-cache and non-v-cache cpus ist bigger although they are using the same ccd.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,itâ€™s not possible.,there is no gear 1 mode for ddr5 regardless of how low you go; itâ€™s simply not implemented.,"even ddr5 configurations officially rated to work at 3600mhz (4 x dual ranked modules, ie.",128gb configurations) still only operate in gear 2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"amdâ€™s new infinity fabric on zen 4 was supposed to run in 1:1 for up to ddr5-6000, is that the same thing as gear 1?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i figured as much, do you suppose raptor lake would support higher memory controller speeds?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i believe it is for up to 6000mhz, but i donâ€™t believe that the two different architectures are compatible from that specification alone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you mean like a gear 1 mode?,no.,"official rated ddr5 speeds are getting a boost of 800mhz, i believe, but those kinds of speeds are already usable with alder lake (up to 6000mhz is fairly easy to achieve), however it will be more interesting to see what it can do beyond that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah id have to say my experience with overclocking has been a lot easier on alder lake than on my past systems, got my 2x16gb rated 4800mhz cl38 overclocked manually to 5200mhz 39-39-39-70, and im expecting 13th gen to be able to push higher (probably 6600-7000)

it just looks odd to me seeing the imc running at only 1300mhz when so many other parts of the cpu can push 5ghz or even 6ghz on some circuits, youd think the imc would be able to handle 2600mhz (half of the 5200mhz of double data rate) with the rate at which other ic's have increased in speed.","i get with super high speeds 8000mhz and above the imc would have to run at 4ghz in gear 1, but at the lower ddr5 speeds why is it still an issue?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the alder lake imc seems to top out at an absolute maximum of 2000mhz (and more like 1600-1800mhz for non-k parts where you canâ€™t boost the voltage), which is well below the â€œstartingâ€ or most common ddr5 speed of 4800mhz (2400mhz), so i can see why gear 1 was determined to be pointless.","also, ddr5 has other architectural changes to improve operational efficiency that helps compensate for the loss of gear 1. itâ€™s not merely ddr4 at faster speeds, thereâ€™s a lot of other stuff going on under the hood.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ahh didnt realize it could only reach 2ghz, guess that wasnt a problem before ddr4 4200 and ddr5.","couldnt find much on google to point me in that direction, thanks for the info!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you sure your cooling solution is up to par/mounted properly?,my i5 12600k which is only ocd a few hundred mhz gets up to 65 degrees in games and 95+ in prime95/intel burn test and thats with a 240mm aio.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what does your memory setup look like?,ddr4/5?,manually tuned timings or xmp?,"the reason i ask is ddr5 xmp profiles are absolutely trash for subtimings and you can adjust a lot of them for 'free' (little/no voltage increases)
could be something to look into.",personally i run e cores off at 5.0/4.8 with ~1.2 vcore under load (windows 10) and it's a great setup.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
e cores aren't used by games on win 11 unless you need more than 16 threads for said game.,so you probably have poor thermal conductivity or low power limits.,"as far as the ring issue, you don't need to disable e cores, just park them using the gigabit anti drm tool.",then your max ring multiplier will be respected (above 3.6 or whatever you clock the e cores too).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this is why i ended up not buying 12900k, as some say certain games have this issue, and certain don't.","disabling e-cores in that application specifically using task manager should resolve this, but you can still use e-cores in rest of the system.",task manager -> details -> select game you are playing -> set affinity -> uncheck cores 8 through the last one.,first 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 cores should performance cores.,"this is why i am leaning towards ryzen now, and i am on i9-9900k with no such issues.",e-cores seem to be the main issue.,"one thing to keep in mind, you will have e-cores still communicating in the background with windows 10, causing stutter or delay.","to truly disable them, you will need to enter bios, and disable e-cores.","which is a painful concept, knowing that you just lost all these cores, just to game on 8 core machine now.","but that should do it for you, if you just game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
buy 13900k when it's out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was gonna say try w11 but you already did.,(temps also fine just to be sure?),also e-cores have been known to cause stutters.there's videos on youtube of games having less stutters or out right removing stutters with e-cores off.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think there are a lot of issues with the windows 11 scheduler still.,"there have been reports that with xmp enabled, it misreports cpu frequency data on some motherboards and that is the issue.",i've noticed in other operating systems that a 12th gen mobile part will report est values with all cores at the same frequency which is often the base frequency of the p cores.,"if microsoft is using that data rather than whatever intel's thread director reports, it could explain all the issues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can you try to customize your power plan where you would set maximum processor state to 99% instead of a 100. that worked for me cause i noticed my cpu would have random temp spikes while gaming.,this got rid of the spikes and also got rid of the 1% lows being too low,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"temps on the cpu, gpu and storage.",get rid of the overclock and run stock.,check ram timings.,could be overheating or failing ssd/hdd(has happened to me).,could be a bad gpu driver install(run ddu and reinstall drivers).,or even a bad windows installation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you need to disable all e-cores in bios.,those e-cores have nothing good to your gaming fps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

same on a 9900k and looking to upgrade.these e-cores are a big  meh..they keep saying they're gonna eventually fix the scheduler but i've been hearing the same thing for months.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
surely that will fix everything lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so, get a 12700k and just disable the e-cores.","you 'only' lose 4 e-cores on the 12700k, so it's not that big of a deal.","the 8 p-cores are still faster than the 10-core 10900k, and single thread performance is much better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the odd thing about the scheduler, it was meant for win 11, but some have issues and some don't, when using win 11  
windows 10 will have issues with scheduler for sure, because win 10 has no scheduler of sort to recognize e-core.","intel cut into their own market by pigeonholing cpu to win 11.   
i looked at some performance tests on same system using win 11 and win 10, and win 10 won in 8 out of 10 tests, and win 11 lost in 2 tests.","adobe premiere had worse rendering times with win 11 for an example, and some games would have less fps than win 10.   
until win 11 sorts this situation out, i am not upgrading to it.","if cpu has no scheduler issues, and no issues reported, i would be on 12900k already.","seems like issues are the same too, recurring issues with games, and weird hang ups in windows.",then others reporting no issues at all.,"no such issues with 9900k, or any other intel cpu without e-cores.","easy to trace the issue to e-cores now, but then they are going to repeat this mistake with 13900k.","clearly intel can do performance cores without e-cores, we saw it in hedt market and in xeon market, but they cannot achieve same results with 100% p-cores currently.",my guess it that cpu would literally melt the solder or fail well before if they had 16 p-cores using alder lake structure.,lower mhz - lower heat.,higher mhz - greater heat.,"i just think it's insulting to give us same 8 cores in 2022, but then add weak cores.",if they manage to have them truly run in parallel it would remove the issue.,"the main reason is e-cores and p-cores use same cache at the same time, and that difference in mhz throws off performance in real time.","i am no cpu engineer, but if they could have 2 cache banks, perhaps it would not be an issue, but then again both caches would need to communicate between the cpu somehow.","intel is not telling us something, and i still believe they cut a major corner to stay on top with i9-12900k over ryzen 5950x  
if they could do 16 p-cores at same single thread performance, and somehow lower tdp, it would scorch in multithread.","it would above some threadrippers then

they either don't know how currently, or don't want to do it.","i will skip i9-13900k this time, even though it will have greater performance vs 7950x, just because of these e-cores.","intel, i will be back when you guys stop doing e-cores.","i still want you guys to win, but not like this.","from synthetic tests though...13900k will definitely win, how will it perform in games is something we don't know.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's not just about e-cores.higher end cpu tend to have more cache/higher clock in general.if you're  not fond of manually oc'ing that's a +.,alder lake is gonna have a big boost in cache too which has been proven to help in gaming.as someone who upgrades once every 5-6 years i usually tend to go for the best at the time and if i have to disable the e-cores im still gonna go for the 13900k if the time comes.,(still waiting on amd tbh),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intel core i5-11400f is as powerfull as amd ryzen 5 3600x; radeon rx 6600 xt is as powerfull as radeon rx 5700 xt.","&#x200b;

>so is the i5-11400f good for my gpu or should i save a little more and buy a better cpu like the 12400f?",core i5 12400f is more powerfull than core i5 11400f and has better perf per watt.,also raptor lake will be launched in one or two month.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's great since the 3060ti is also a beefier card then the 6600 xt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you have the 11400f or 11400 with integrated graphics if yes then is there any diffrence in performance?,since in my country the 11400 costs the same as the 12400f.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well the 5600 is already on sale and its 180$ and the intel i5-11400f is 165$ + it gives an digital copy of call of duty modern warfare ii

also the ryzen 5 5600x is 230 $ and the i5 12400f is  207$ +  cod mw2

that's why intel got my interest beacuse of their good prices with good performance but i will also reconsider amd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 11400 is closer to a 5600x than a 3600x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is no difference in performance it's just that one has an igpu and the other doesn't,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"don't forget the motherboard cost, by the time you buy a motherboard you'll be out more money than it would if you just bought the 5600 and the game, assuming you really want the game.","when i upgraded (from a 2600, so basically the same position you're in, except i didn't get a game), the entire reason i went with the 5600x is because if i bought a 12400+motherboard it would've been more than even the 5800x at the time, and i didn't want to spend that much.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"like others said :   

1) dont forget the extra mobo cost you would need to spend with the intel option                         
2) you could also re-sell your 2600  to further reduce the cost of the 5600.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12400f is best out of all mentioned if your budget can stretch to it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sell your current mobo+cpu for 120-170$(depends on what mobo you have).,the 2600 can go for 80$ then depends on motherboard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ive seen the 5600 on sale for $140-160 several times in the last few weeks.,you could keep a watch out for deals.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if i get at least 100$ on both combined then i'm set.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably can get more imo unless youâ€™re on a320,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thats exactly on what im on the a320m-h,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
try for 120$ if you canâ€™t 100 is good.,need to do this fast as new gen is right around the corner which will drag prices further down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes it's enough.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if itâ€™s a 4+4 connector on your psu you should connect that to the 8 pin, and you are fine to not connect the standalone 4 pin.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you don't need to connect the remaining 4 pins until n unless you overclock the cpu or use an high end graphic card like 3090,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've got a similar setup; 12400f and msi b660 mag mortar ddr4+wifi.,"except i have two 8 pins on mobo, i just use one 8pin and the 12400f gets all it needs from it, even with power limits raised.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it would run with 4 pins.,dont even need 8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i see, what's your average cpu temp btw ?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i normally keep my limits at default since i'm using the rm1 stock cooler, average 50-60â°c, but will reach almost 90 during turbo which quickly falls back down to 75ish once it stops turbo.","i did do some testing with limits raised and it sat between 80-90 under heavy load, no thermal throttling, but fan gets pretty noisy.","i eventually plan on getting a better cooler just for noise reduction, otherwise stock cooler is adequate, even at full power draw.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"what do you mean by ""stops turbo"" ?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with stock power limits it will only turbo for several seconds before slowing back down to its maximum *non turbo* speed.,it's extremely noticeable because the difference in temperature and thus fan speed sounds like the difference between a jet engine and a desk fan.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
r/overclocking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
put it to 3200 and see does that help.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"try memtest @3600 mhz

if you can do it no problem, then it has nth to do with ram speed",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can you post a link to where you read about this issue.,i have never heard of 12th gen intel cpus having this problem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
non k chips have locked system agent voltage.,you can't get it high enough by default to push ddr4 to ideal speeds.,ddr5 can push around 6000mhz with the same locked voltage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
remove 2nd monitor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably wrong sub.,i assume the bios and all drivers (especially chipset drivers) are up to date.,have you tried different usb ports?,disconnect all usb devices except mouse/keyboard.,you seem to use wireless.,go completely wired while troubleshooting.,try a different mouse/keyboard if possible.,are you overclocking?,"if you changed settings in bios, reset your bios to default and test.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you go into bios and disable e-cores.,will issue persist?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not sure about warzone, but i know there are some games that perform better with the slow cores disabled.","it's a big thing in the star citizen community, where people had stuttering/microstuttering with the slow cores enabled because windows 10 and 11 both keep messing up the scheduling, and off loading time critical tasks to the slow cores.","disabling them in the bios is an easy thing to do, you might want to try it out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you sure itâ€™s not just you going crazy?,placebo affect goes lord of ways.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i've had a look at usbtreeview 

and it says that all my usbs only support usb 2.0 max?",https://imgur.com/a/n11rts0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"change the gfx card, i had the same issues with that card.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i know i have seen people having strange issues on gigabyte z690 ddr4 boards but i assume they have been ironed out by now.,just for a quick test you can try keeping your 3600 xmp timings but run your ram down at 3200. fps will be lower but focus on the input lag to see if things have improved.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dp or hdmi to monitor?,if it's hdmi then try dp.,whats your sound connected to?,usb but especially blutooth and hdmi sound can make trouble.,turned off rgb light support for mouse and keyboard?,just some ideas...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"try to permanently disable the ironically named ""fullscreen optimizations"" and use true fullscreen mode.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
already done that before :(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes they are,

i've tried all the usb ports, i've disconnected the f usb as well just to see if it would help with the bandwidth; also tried different keyboards/mouse (all wired) to no affect

i've got all the stock bios settings atm, but i've overclocked when i first got the cpu mobo combo

putting it in different usb ports does mitigate the ""feel"" of input.",but it's strange how it only affects me in warzone/cs go.,i play escape from tarkov and it seems to be fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it does unfortunately :(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
by the slow cores you mean the e cores?,i've already done this before :(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no because, when restarting i get a couple of minutes of clarity, where i'll be 10-0 then it'll go downhill someone else has confirmed, when they jumped on my pc",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"what issues did you have exactly, can you tell me?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i've done that as well, i've tried stock, 3000, 3200, 3600 no dice ahh",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"both are dp, but iâ€™ve had hdmi
i have hyperx cloud ii iâ€™ve heard they can cause issues",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah i stopped calling them efficiency cores, as they're not more efficient than the regular cores, just slower.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sounds fine then.,i assume you also did track all temperatures e.g.,using hwinfo?,used both rams idependent as single module and so on?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah right okay, no i thought so, was just confirming 

but yeah i've done this before, in fact gigabyte have got a hot key so that you can toggle them on and off, as they're self aware lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, temps are fine around 55 max 65 under load, my gpu hotspot is around 75 dunno if that would do anything?","ram is in dual channel, and yes tried it with one stick, also tried another ram type",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i feel with you.,it took me half year to find out that i had a ethernet cable that turned bad when it warmed up.,resulting in 1gbit link speed going down to  to 100mbit non duplex while playing.,caused weird lags then.,but you wrote that you already tested wlan too.,so can't be the same problem.,"sry, but i have no further ideas for your problem.",i wish good luck solving it somehow!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah i mean i still haven't tested plugging into the router directly, i'm waiting for us to be able to move back into my room, but i just feel it won't be as simple as that since the feeling was the same on powerline and wifi, but who knows

you've been helpful, thank you for your suggestions!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
old cpus are often a trap.,"value stays too high, even on the used market, and you are buying a platform with outdated features and lower performance.","it only sometimes makes sense if you're in a country with bad import costs of new products, like brazil.","for example the i3-12100 > i5-10400, nearly identical pricing even when its new vs used.","same thing when you go back further and look at a higher tier model, like an i5-9600k.","same prices used as a new 12100, but the 9600k performs worse and uses more power.","you say you want to do overclocking, but overclocking is no longer value oriented.","chips are pushed hard from the factory, and maybe you get a few percent more performance with a 24/7 overclock, but you'll need a better cooler, a k-series cpu, better z-series board, etc.","i have always gone the overclocking route for over a decade, and it just no longer makes sense for cpus for the average person.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably the i3 10105f?,the cheapest option in the market now.,don't even need to buy old.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ever since ryzen came out, there's been little reason to get an older cpu for either amd or intel, unless new stuff is just completely out of your price range, even the low-end (12100f+good b660+16gb of ram ends up at around around $280, around $300 after taxes, or you could even go with a cheaper motherboard, but you're only gonna end up saving maybe $20 or so).","let's say you go with a ryzen 3 3100, they go for around $50 or so on ebay, a b450 motherboard (about $70 at the lowest, but you get what you pay for, you'll probably want a $100-120 motherboard), and ram ends up being the same price, overall you're saving about $112 if you go with the cheapest motherboard, however only around $50 if you go with a similar quality motherboard, but you're getting an overall worse product at the end up of since the 3100 is a much worse cpu than the 12100f, ideally you'd want to go with at least a 3600, however even used 3600 on ebay for for about $100, however if you wanted to you could just buy a cheaper lga1700 motherboard and it'll end up being a very similar price.","although there is the 10100f, while gaming would be pretty decent for the cpu it is, motherboard prices are pretty similar to motherboards for the 12100f, so you're only saving about $50 overall, i'd argue it's not worth it, especially since outside of gaming (strictly talking fps) the performance will be worse, if you play games where it needs to load large maps then the slower cpu can be noticeable (years ago i went from an i5-6600 to a ryzen 5 2600, load times and fps were more or less the same, i just wanted the extra threads at the time, however when i upgraded to a 5600x it was a day and night difference for load times, i remember some maps could take as much as around 35-40 seconds to load, load times about halved).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
youâ€™d do well to be more specific about the kind of gaming you have in mind.,a pentium 233 mmx is pretty good for dos gamesâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

totally spot on.,"it used to make sense at times to buy an older chip and overclock the hell out of it, but not anymore.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i hope that this becomes the consensus.,"too many people buy, for example, a 12700k, z690 and expensive cooler, when the patience of a 12700f, b660, and $50 cooler is almost identical.",plus they can spend the extra money on other parts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

just a 10% increase over the 12th gen. not looking so good for amd.,but the 7600x matching the 12900k is something else,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they also most likely picked the benchmark where they did the best over intel.,i have a feeling when the real benchmarks come out it's going to be pretty much the same single thread performance as alder lake on average.,i don't see why people think amd is ahead when even with a process node advantage they can barely beat a 1 year old intel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that's the part that i think crosses a bit of a line.,"amd isn't unique here, so i'm not going to drag it too far, but it is downright fraudulent.",cutting off the base and hiding the scaling to impact visual perception is misleading.,putting things on the same graph with completely different scaling (and not making clear how/why) is lying.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the scale looks okay to me?,except for the last one which seems to be a mistake because the number changes but the bar stays identical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think the bars have the correct length, but the numbers above where changed later... i think between 7950x and 7900x ist no different, the barslength shows it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that's one thing but the other is that benchmark is done in quick bursts which i think are not enough to accurately measure performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it makes sense, because if you have products at 101, 103, and 105% of base performance, in order to show any difference in the bars, your entire screen will have to be taken up by them if you start at 0, or the bars will look identical if you have them smaller.","instead, you can start all bars at say 100, the difference is more visually noticeable, consumers are more likely to actually consider it a real difference, even when it's not.",literally every manufacturer does this.,intel is no different.,it's not technically misleading as long as the start of the scale is listed somewhere.,"for all people here saying it should start at 0, customers don't actually want a graph where they need a magnifying glass to see the difference, or it to take up an entire screen in portrait mode.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not here.","when the intent is show your competitiveness versus a business rival, it's deceptive, not something they did for readability's sake.",you dont understand this is more than just about being able to read a graph.,"it's working on a more psychological level, even for many who can read the numbers fine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 7700x wonâ€™t even do that, the leaked 13600k samples so far are scoring something like 24000 in cinebench and the 7700x is *not* 60% faster than the 5800x.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in gaming.... where intel's own $300 chip would perform the same.,hell you can get a sub $200 12400 and get nearly the same performance as a 12900k in most games.,comparing lower core-count cpus to higher core-count cpus in gaming instead of the similarly priced alternative is misleading.,a 12600k would be almost the same or basically identical after equalizing clocks in those games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't believe the marketing.,there is not much difference in gaming between intel's own $250 cpu and 12900k.,you just saw some hype material and fell for it.,that's exactly what they wanted to get at.,that's why you shouldn't take anything in these presentations seriously.,they talked more about intel than their own products.,"reality is that, it's comparable to a year old product with a node advantage for higher cost of entry.","if you present it this way, it's not so impressive anymore.",marketing and blind fanboys take the fun out of the actual engineering and tech and all the impressive work that went into these products.,"7000 series are great, specially 7950 seems like a no brainer but not the way they present it.","they didn't compare these against their own 5800x3d for example, the current best gaming cpu.",did you ask why is that?,because it doesn't look good there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think intel's real problem will be power draw.,"5950x is already more efficient than a 12900k, amd is claiming the 7950x is 74% more efficient at 65watts!",which is incredible!,will be interesting to see how 13th gen performs under tight power constraints.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'd take ""only"" 10% better performance for 1/2-3/4 the power over 15-20% better performance for 240 watts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"single threaded should match ryzen 7000, however multi-core should run well ahead of amd.",the i5-13600k scores higher in cinebench mt by over 50-60% compared to the 7600x based on the leaks.,the ryzen 7 7700x unfortunately will be competing with the i5 in that regard.,"this is thanks to the improvement to st, but also the doubling(or addition) of e-cores.",meteor lake is expected to have bigger gains though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"12900k max turbo boost = 5.3ghz

clock speed alone will, on single or light thread, beat zen 4 (all of them).",for a 13900k.,the call-out on 13600k is that its single core turbo is only 5.3ghz.,that's what i was getting at with the sku differentiation on raptor lake.,pat should fire the marketing people if they did that to differentiate the skus.,"whether you win on multi-core, frankly with both zen 4 and raptor, will likely depend on how much cooling you have.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if they had even done just a little more performative appreciation for their old low to mid end base, especially when it came to rocm, i would probably have some lasting loyalty.",now i just hope they stay sharp enough to keep intel from getting greedy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"amd almost didnt release the 5600 until they were forced to, when 12400 started eating up their marketshare.",amd will not release their budget options until intel forces their hand,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

we really shouldn't include benchmark scores with oc'ed cpus.,most of those geekbench scores are oc and/or exotic cooling.,in some cases probably even liquid nitrogen.,normally a 12900k scores between 1950-2050. amd were kind to intel in this case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"my guess is avx-512 would make the cores bigger, which defeats the purpose of the e cores as a concept.","contrary to popular belief, these little cores are aiming for silicon area efficiency, not power efficiency.",and most likely for the same reason they are not hyperthreaded.,iirc a rumor was claiming mtl would support avx-512 for both p and e cores.,"it's plausible, given the fact 14th gen is supposed to have a new generation of little cores called ""crestmont"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they were probably supposed to launch a few months following, or alongside lakefield.",with meteor lake combining 3d stacking and hybrid cores on the desktop after alder lake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> if the hybrid cpu was years in the planning, why would intel not design the e-cores to support avx-512?",because everyone was complaining about avx-512 being a huge waste and power vampire.,now suddenly everyone loves it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i meant alder lake, hybrid of glc and gmt first appeared in 2018 slides.",hybrid architecture has been around for a lot longer of course,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> my guess is avx-512 would make the cores bigger, which defeats the purpose of the e cores as a concept.",the way the efficiency cores handle this is to microcode bigger vector ops and then break them down into smaller ones.,"so for example, since they don't have a 256 bit vector alu, each 256 bit avx2 operation is split into 2 individual uops that run one at a time so that you don't need to add much extra hardware.","this will be slower, but it makes sure that software is compatible with both cores.","for avx512 they would probably do the same, except instead of 2 operations it would be 4.

they didn't do this because gracemont is based on tremont, which was designed well before intel was going to do hybrid cpus.","presumably they'll correct this in crestmont or its successors, whatever is the first part designed after they decided to do hybrid cpus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14th gen doesn't support avx 512. that was recently confirmed.,"i think they won't support it until e cores become capable enough, which won't happen soon.","anyway, wasn't avx 512 called ""useless"" and ""intel's gimmick""?",why all of a sudden it matters for the mainstream market?,"for workstations and higher intel isn't abandoning it, since p core server chips support it.","i guess we'll see what they do with e core server chips, i believe xeon phi did have some avx 512 capabilities.","plus avx 512 isn't one unified feature, i think different cpus have different levels of avx512 support",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"avx-512 on skylake-sp used tons of power, but on 7nm it is pretty awesome.",fixes lots wrong with avx2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at least avx-512 is not junk of piece hardware on my cpu.,it working very well especially it had 2 x 512-bit fma on each cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"skymont is rumored to be a redesign, so arrow lake might finally bring avx512 back on client.","if it isn't skymont, maybe some ""royal e core"" or whatever on 14a process might",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wasn't aware the e cores split the avx2 operations in 2 uops.,"if that's the case and intel can emulate avx-512 support in a similar way with 4 uops, then why release both adl and rpl without avx-512?","was it because they were behind on schedule and wanted to release asap, or was crestmont still in development?","if they can already split avx2 operations, doing the same for avx-512 doesn't look like it requires a lot of effort.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's a bummer.,"i hoped mtl would support it, even though it is more of a nice to have thing, rather than a necessity.","anyway, avx-512 is indeed useless for the average consumer, the only real application benefitting from its existence so far is rpcs3.","modern c++ compilers can spit out avx-512 instructions, but afaik it is not really common, maybe with xeon phi things are different.",all the practical examples i have seen take advantage of the instrictics manually with hand written code.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">14th gen doesn't support avx 512.

source?",">anyway, wasn't avx 512 called ""useless"" and ""intel's gimmick""?",if you listened to clueless people.,it actually fills out tons of stuff avx1/2 should have had but was missing.,"i'm skeptical they'd remove it since it leaves avx in kind of a bad, half-finished spot.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not all avx-512 instruction required tons of power.,7nm on amd side had only 1 x 512-bit fma output port (zen4).,**14nm on my 18 core skylake x had 2 x 512-bit fma output each cores.,"**

thus **skylake x consumed more power** than zen4.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

12600k will work fine.,my son's computer has a 12600k with windows 10 and he has no issues at all in gaming.,he won't upgrade to win 11 either (neither will i yet).,we will wait til bugs are mostly out of 11. if you can wait 13th gen may be worth the wait.,i have a 12500 myself (which is more than plenty for what i use it for - had 4790k til earlier this year) and i might upgrade to a 13th gen i-5 later or i-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

doesn't the 12600k only have 4 e-cores?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

they have the same lga1700 socket.,"in general, it will support.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it be disabled 4 e-cores from i7 or i9 with 8 e-cores.,then it just has 4 e-cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

oh the 4 kb read in ssd benchmarks.,"understandable, i didn't think that they had anything to do with cpu performance though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that was from before, now problems are gone",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was a bit sceptical about that because in workstation/server market they don't spoil their customers as in gaming hw industry.,"so i have contacted supermicro support yesterday about their x13sae board and here is their response:

>yes, x13sae-f can support intel core 13th gen cpu with bios update.",the bios will be released next month.,"however, the bios can't be updated with intel core 13th gen cpu.","so it's good, but one would need to buy / borrow an adler lake cpu just to upgrade bios.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, if you want a cpu with high clock speeds and p-cores only, i'd suggest you to go with amd.",they do exactly that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 4k performance has positive correlation with the frequency of cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there's like a 10% discount through beneplace or something if i'm remembering correctly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no discount off hand i ever recall.,retied from apple 2019 even employees ( corporate ) only got 25% off one time a year.,rest of the year its 10% and you have a employee store page you could use points at if you had acquired them from sales etc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
used to work there many moons ago.,macbook was indeed an option for a work laptop,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

isnt the student discount like 10% anyways and requires no verification?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no discount for apple products.,only on intel products.,"edit: hmm, i guess there is supposed to be, but the pricing on macbooks didn't seem any different when i went through the discount program.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they are supposed to ask for student id or school number for it technically but at the apple store those are non corporate employees.,they do not have the same benefits as corporate.,"not sure why never asked, but i do know it was that way for 2 decades of work there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you worked with apple on a project or as a team they would allow people to purchase from the employee website it gave a 10-15% discount at most to non employees and 25% off once a year( and they keep track ).,things may have change/d since 2019 when i retired but that's how it was my whole time there.,"but i really didn't need to buy a mac either i had 2 x27"" imac's and a mac pro at my fingers always.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

have u considered the 12700?,wanna say i've seen it lately for between $350 and $399.,"and to answer your question, 12th gen i9 and a 3070 should run smooth as a baby's butt.",i might be mistaking but i think even the 12 gen i5 can run a 3070 just fine.,the 12600 that is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i mean, i canâ€™t say how many fps youâ€™ll get (plus that depends on your screen resolution as well), but the 12900kf is one ofâ€”if not the mostâ€”powerful consumer processor, so itâ€™s more than capable of a good gaming experience.","all iâ€™m saying is that amd is releasing processors in september, and intel in q4 as well.","even if you donâ€™t want the amd cpu, intel will have to knock their prices a little bit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"0.1% (not shown on this chart) and 1% lows are extremely important for fluidity in gaming, and itâ€™s clear in this specific example the 12900k delivers the best performance - and steps ahead even further with a proper core and memory tune

no.,there aren't any 500hz monitors on sale right now.,there is a single 500hz monitor announced.,"and since it is a tn panel, i doubt it would worth whatever price they will charge for it.",and it isn't even on sale yet.,they just announce it as a bleeding edge tech achieved in a lab.,no commercial product or sale date.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

x3d literally loses to 12700k in pubg.,3d cache is great for many titles but the performance gain is still very game dependent.,but somehow thereâ€™s just a blanket expectation that itâ€™ll outperform everything in gaming.,i would always recommend doing a bit of research on benchmarks for most played games and looking at best value per frame if money is a consideration.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if you've got decent enough hardware waiting isn't too bad, 5800x3d would've been a massive upgrade for me but raptor lake or zen 4x3d will be an even bigger upgrade, zen 4 is a let down, amd charging $299 for 7600x is just as bad as when intel kept cranking out 4 core i7's for 5+ years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

now oled technically blows tn out of the water, with true sub 1ms response times.",i just wish someone would make a super high refresh rate oled panel for competitive gaming.,"it would be an incredible experience to see for instance, 240hz on an oled.",the smoothest and sharpest motion clarity you can get with sample and hold display tech.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

itâ€™s battlenet it literally tells you requires a battlenet account and has a link for you to create one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you have to wait.,intel will give you the key on release day which is stupid because [battle.net](https://battle.net) would already lock it from you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was hoping i could change my time-zone on my pc but that didn't work.,"it's still the 27th where i am, 7pm.","what zone are you in, it's already the 28th for you?",maybe intel releases it based on midnight the 28th wherever intel's hq is or something.,says intel is in california so maybe 12am pdt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you get the code once the pc is shipped the company you bought from will email you the master key but intels site is fkd rn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea ä± have the same thing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
boys keep refreshing the website i just got it to work make sure you wait for the redeem now blue button and click it and wait for 5 mins and itll work,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and did the retailer give you the key or did you have to redeem it on intel website?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what happens if i return the cpu after i activate the intel master key?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the laptop or the code?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah i'm in the same boat, but just in case you didn't know i'm pretty sure we have to go back to the intel software offer website and get the game code from there when they let us (should be 12am the 28th or sometime the 28th), then redeem that code on battle net.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you get it working im in the same boat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

click â€œhereâ€,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah the website is fkd atm i have done all the shit but on battle net its stuck on this game is currently not avalible its got the install button but its dark blue not highlighted to download it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it actually worked for me.,"it was down for maintenance for a while, but it started working and i was able to download the game (still had to refresh a few times for it to load without errors though).",guess they just don't care enough to have a capable server for a promo website,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah intel messaged me back saying they are trying to fix it aye,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"got it, much appreciated ðÿ‘",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think you will get the answer on oct 28. they might check it then.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is the email from best buy?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so amazon sent me an email after i went on live chat with an amazon rep about my issue.,they gave me a master key and told me to sign up on the intel website.,"so if you don't get your master key, make sure you contact best buy's support so you don't miss out on the free game(s).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wait seriously?,how's it not considered a preorder?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i was doing some research and i believe youâ€™re right.,says my game is available on the 28th which would be midnight (est) for me.,sucks that we can pre download it though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got it to work last night at 8:30 pm central time.,maybe the intel site is over loaded,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yes, from best buy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
im in the same boat from sydney australia is it stuck on 'you cant install this game yet' launch was 3pm aest but for the intel code do we have to wait till 12am?,considering buying the game hahaha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thatâ€™s strange, for me it refreshed the page to which the redeem button appeared.",now iâ€™m not even getting what you shared earlier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if you want to oc all core 5.0, probably not, even nh-d15 cant really handle it.",except if you lucky enough to hit the silicon jackpot.,"&#x200b;

"impossible, intel requires at least 1 performance core to work.","you can watch some alder lake benchmark on youtube, people tried that, but the lowest number of p-core that can be set in bios is 1.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
isn't it already doing this by default?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, but you can adjust the power plan in windows.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, on the performance monitor most things cause cores 2/3 to spike up but the ones that are e cores i believe are cores 7-13",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i9 will be a bit better.,there are benchmarks out there if you want to look.,"we have no information on raptorlake quicksync yet,  it might be same as adl but you shouldn't buy 12900k right now, just wait a month or two.","12700k is quite a bit cheaper but performs like 10% worse, see here if its worth it to you.","[https://www.techpowerup.com/review/intel-core-i7-12700k-alder-lake-12th-gen/14.html](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/intel-core-i7-12700k-alder-lake-12th-gen/14.html)

either is drastically better than 5600x.",you could also just buy 5950x and slot in your current desktop if your motherboard can handle the power delivery.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think 13900k will do the job perfectly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is a lot of confusion going on here.,all 12 gen intel cpus will perform about the same and have same quality when using quicksync because they all have the same quicksync hardware.,the differences come with generations where usually there is a new quicksync version in each generation.,intels best quicksync version is currently in intel arc gpus and will probably be on the 13th gen. the m1 also has hardware acceleration for hevc similar to intels quicksync which is why that is also fast.,the amd 5600 does not have a gpu in it so there is no hardware acceleration for hevc and is instead doing it all in software which is why you are seeing a speed difference.,the software encoding has a massive benefit of being able to encode with much greater efficiency though if that is what you are after.,for software encoding thats where higher tier cpu is better with the 5950x being the current consumer champ for encoding.,hardware accelerated encoding is mostly for live streaming or if size is not an issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if you actually read what it tries to do you will quickly realize how (at least on adl) it's mostly pointless and ineffective.,this is no exaggeration.,thread director classifies threads into 4 classes on adl.,"see this slide from anandtech, sourced directly from intel's hotchips ([link](https://images.anandtech.com/doci/16959/td%20classes_575px.jpg)).","these are:

1. busy loops - uncommon
2. mainstream apps - this is practically everything you do
3.","""emerging applications"" which is intel's name for avx heavy apps (2 classes of avx)

essentially what this tries to solve is, if you were running 2 concurrent workloads - both in the foreground - and one is mainstream and the other is a rare ""emerging application"" with heavy avx.",if you actually manage to use up every single p-core and you spill over to e-cores... which workloads threads should stay on the p-cores?,so all else being equal (i.e.,"workloads in the foreground, same priority, etc etc)... which thread is going to make the best use of a p-core?","thread director will say the avx heavy thread is best, move someone else.",that's it in a nutshell.,but people aren't running avx heavy workloads.,especially not **concurrently** at the same time with other apps at the **same priority in the foreground**.,"and if you are doing these things, keep in mind it still doesn't matter if you have enough p-cores for both tasks, it only matters when spilling over to e-cores.","so if you bought say a 12900k with 8p-cores, thread director is even less useful.",i have yet to find a single reviewer actually demonstrate thread director in action.,its functionality is such a limited obscure edge case.,"disappointingly, even anandtech failed to properly review the thing.",i was really hoping they might dig in and do it justice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my experience on windows 11 has been solid.,"i've never even had reason to think ""what type of core is this being scheduled on?",""".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm still very skeptical of the thing.,on the arm side big.little has never had anything similar and they got around just fine with fancy schedulers.,on linux apparently the thread director outright doesn't work and adl works just fine.,"now, i believe android and linux share the same scheduler (schedutil).",maybe the thread director is there just to help the windows scheduler?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it just works.,"the e-cores are a net win, at least on win11.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> but people aren't running avx heavy workloads.,especially not concurrently  at the same time with other apps at the same priority in the foreground.,"fwiw, a bunch of foreground threads using a mix of avx and scalar would describe a lot of game engines as well as things like gpu device drivers pretty well.",basically anything touching pixel or texture data.,i agree with your larger point though.,you don't need 100 extra performance counters to figure out that a game engine is probably performance critical.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"thatâ€™s because windows scheduler is infamously bad, while linux is not.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"why would the windows scheduler need help, it's also run arm big.little for years and years (first windows phone, then later on the desktop, same kernel & scheduler).",performance of adl on win10 is nearly identical without thread director.,maybe the thread director is there just for... marketing fluff?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,it depends on other networks in your area.,mine is at 36 because my neighbors are not using that channel (5 ghz ax 6e),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37 is one of the 6 ghz band channels.,you can change you ap to use a different one but since 6 ghz is so new probably not many people using any of them so it won't matter too much.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ohhh i see, thank you",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
generally the router will pick a channel that has least interference from neighbors.,"as mentioned, you can choose your own, but you need some guidance of  neighboring channel usage and signal strength.","if you are on windows, there is a neat tool in the windows store called  ""wifi analyzer"" by matt haffner.","it will show channel usage in your area, including your channel, and the relative signal strengths graphically or in a table.",you can use this information to guide you in manually choosing a channel if you wish to.,"i do not have a 6e router, only 6 so i don't know if the 6ghz spectrum channels are supported in the tool - not yet i expect.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
