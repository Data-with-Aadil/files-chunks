single core is lower amperage than gaming amperage...so i have no idea what you mean.,and also gaming can be pretty heavy depending on the game.,vid is not actual vcore.,so to get 6ghz its probably around 1.45ish.,hell even in what you showed me it looks like the v/f curve for 6ghz is 1.428.... if your gaming your probably at a vcore of around 1.3-1.4....which is you see what i said above is normal and safe for gaming amperage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

skylake or 6th gen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also if you're using just the igp to do the encoding/decoding...that's not what quicksync does.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
icelake and newer can decode hevc 444.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"damn, those are gonna be hard to find, but thanks though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"unfortunately the app i use doesn't support av1 yet, and doesn't seem like it will get support in the near future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that same page mentions that tiger lake and higher supports hevc 12-bit 4:4:4. in my case i just need 10-bit, but wouldn't they support it since it's a lower version?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4:4:4?,skylake caps out at 8-bit 4:2:0 iirc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as other users said, skylake doesn't do 4:4:4, so it won't work.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
really?,"i thought quicksync was intel's version of nvenc/nvdec, and the wikipedia page seems to say so.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
really?,"i thought quicksync was intel's version of nvenc/nvdec, and the wikipedia page seems to say so.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but from what i'm reading here it kinda implies that it's 12bit hd which is like 1080p not 4k it's a resolution distinction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'd say you grab a 12100 and be done with the search, should be cheap enough.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"exactly, one of the very few things intel did from skylake to kaby lake was improve hevc support, my old 6700hq laptop would shit itself whenever i sent 10 bit hevc at it, never tried 4:4:4 8-bit video but i'd be surprised if it was watchable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can always use a 12100 or a 13100 or an a380 though.,"driver issues aside, if you manage to get any of those working it might be okay.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is correct.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"quicksync is intel's work-share between gpu and igpu to speed up encode/decode jobs, technology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"unfortunately intel gpus haven't arrived to argentina yet, and i doubt they will since both nvidia and amd's latest gpus aren't here too.",we don't even have 13th gen yet.,will look into the 12100.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't think that's correct.,"the work-share is done by the os when detecting multiple gpus (be it dgpu or igpu), and it assigns simple jobs to the igpu to leave the dgpu for heavier tasks, though that is configurable on some os.","quicksync is a dedicated chip inside intel's igpu whose's sole purpose is to encode/decode video, speeding up the process and improving the quality.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"considering the overall power of the igpu of an intel 12th gen is not up to a 1050ti and the 1050ti can't do that, there's no hope of the igpu doing more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's not the gpu processing power that matters here, its the dedicated encoding/decoding chip's capabilities.","a quick search shows that, as other stated before, a 6th gen cpu can do the same as my 1050ti.","this dedicated chip is improved on each generation, and doesn't correspond to the cpu's raw performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ideally you aren't even using the gpu when hardware decoding, just the hardware decoder, so the gpu power is irrelevant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes the cpu is easily more powerful than the 1050ti...but the igpu is a seperate thing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hardware encoding implies hardware is used...which hardware would you be using then?,quicksync is useful because the igpu is literally doing nothing else and can focus on encode/decode in tandem with something else handling the computer actually being on and booted and displaying things.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hardware encoders are also a separate thing from a gpu's general processing rate.,quicksync is fine let it be.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hardware encoding is actually using separate fixed-function hardware to do the encoding.,"like how in intel's meteorlake the vpu is going to ""do"" ai-related stuff (whatever that ends up meaning) without using the cpu at all.","not all the work is being done on said hardware of course, but if you use game dvr and set task manager to show individual units' graphs on windows it shows that it's using a ""video processing"" part instead of the 3d part of the core",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>hardware encoding implies hardware is used...which hardware would you be using then?,the hardware decoder.,">quicksync is useful because the igpu is literally doing nothing else and can focus on encode/decode

you have no idea what you're talking about.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, the encoding hardware for an intel cpu is in the igpu part of the chip, and quicksync uses that in conjunction with something else doing all the computer stuff aside to encode/decode, or nvidia's nvenc/hvec stuff is in the gpu and in general using quicksync is done when you have a gpu doing the display/play stuff and the igpu doing the encode/decode bit.",nvidia's encode/decode is stronger than intels and amd's is generally ignored or considered bad.,"i'd consider a new jraphics card before buying an 11th gen, they really weren't that much of a step up from 10th, but upgrading to even a 3050 will make a huge difference in every possibly way including encode/decode because nvenc is the better system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i guess the important thing to note is that the video format the (fixed-function) hardware (en/de)coder supports generally isn't related to the actual power of the hardware but is more like an instruction set that it supports.,"like if you have an 11900k with avx 512 it might be faster in some tasks than a 12900k because it supports fixed function avx512 ""acceleration"" when the 12900k might need to do the calculations with avx 256 then.","similarly, intel's uhd 730 can hardware decode 4:4:4 hevc while the 1050ti can't (not even the 1080ti iirc) just because it doesn't support the format

i dunno this is definitely patronizing but i kind of feel bad if someone just talks to the person like ""you have no idea what you're talking about"", so that's all.",lol.,"it's just a misconception not a complete lack of understanding (ex: i do actually know that hardware encoding in the kaby lake igpus used some 3d processing power which is also used by games, but it also uses the actual encoder)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

just undervolt without changing the speed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"undervolting doesnt decrease performance if done correctly, so no difference on battery or not.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
undervolting doesn't reduce performance.,in some cases it increases performance instead.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can also lower the maximum boost on battery to improve efficiency,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it does, but its a matter of what you want.",more efficiency will often have less performance as you will drop the speed to decrease volts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thats not undervolting.,thats power limitting.,"undervolting is lowering voltages while maintaining same clock speeds, therefore, you dont loose performance.",lowering voltages lower than required for your cpu max speeds is power limitting.,two different things.,"my 13600k used 190w by default on cinebench multicore test, and got 24k points.","i undervolted it, so it uses 170w, while scoring same 24k points.","then, i put a power limit of 160w, making cpu use even less power, but loosing a bit of performance, it was like 23500 points on cinebench.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
clearly you do not know the art of overclocking.,"overclocking is not just increasing the speed, undervolt is also an overclock.","when undervolting you are pushing more than the set voltage can do at stock, it doesnt need to be the top speed.","while power limiting is when you still stand in the stock speeds just with limited power, you are not exceeding what manufacturer has set.","&#x200b;

this is probably unknown to a lot of people in pc subs, overclocking is just as it sound going above set limits.",when max volt is 1.1v and speed in increased from 2 ghz to 2.1 ghz its an overclock and so is 0.9 volt max speed jump from 1.8ghz to 1.9 ghz.,"undervolt to 100w will be more powerful than a power limit to 100w, since its actually oc vs stock",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"clearly i know more than you, because you are talking in circles and havent said anything that would make anything i said incorrect.","undervolt is not an overclock, even by intel or motherboard oem definitions.","only k series cpus from intel unlocked for overclock, yet you can undervolt any cpus, not only k series.",so your definitions are wrong.,"undervolt is not overclock, its 2 different things, and intel, gigabyte, msi, etc think the same.","undervolt is increasing efficiency, nothing to do with overclock, which increases performance, not efficiency.","power limitting is limitting power so your cpu no longer performs as it would on stock settings, resulting in less performance, less power use, less heat.","you are talking nonsense, no one even mentioned clock speeds or overclocks, no idea why are you bringing that in.",intel cpus have standart clock multiplier and you wont change it simply by undervolting.,"i have no idea what are you trying to say with your examples, but everyone knows that, its not any secret knowledge.","undervolt is simply lowering voltage for the same clocks, thus, increasing efficiency, by using less power, but getting same performance.",not less.,that is undervolt.,"if you undervolt too much, you dont loose performance.",your cpu becomes not stable and crash.,"if you have undervolt protection turned on in bios, it wont crash, but you will loose performance, as something called clock stretching will happen when cpu doesnt get enough voltage to boost anymore.",this is no longer correct undervolt.,"so i repeat again, main point, which i said, and you didnt agree.",you dont loose performance with correctly done undervolt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you clearly dont know, nor understood what i said.","to start of intel is not locked from overclocks, its locked from increasing the clock above its maximum boost.",z boards can somewhat by pass it and on older motherboards undervolt was not even an option.,what can you do with the cpu depends a lot on the motherboard it self.,overclocks are meant for power not efficiency?,"perhaps, but what happens when you overclock with the stock power limits?",it gets 20% boost lets say and uses 100w (its max tdp) and somehow the one with 20% less power using 98w is more efficient?,not how it works.,"&#x200b;

i will repeat, overclock is when you go faster then what tha manufacturer has set.","so in case of undervolt stock is 0.9v 1.8 ghz if you were to lock it to that you would be simple power limiting, but if you choose to do 0.9v with 1.85 ghz thats an undervolt.","oc and undervolt  are eesentially the same thing, just when going below stock volts we call it undervolt and same/above overclock.",overclock example stock 1.1v 2ghz and speed is increase to 1.1 2.05ghz (funny how it is still same volt but more power.,sound familiar doesnt  it?)...,now i ask in what way are they different?,"sure the volts are different speeds are too, but are you going to claim that it is not the same thing just because the volts and speed differ?","no, you wont.","note, in both scenarios here you increase efficiency with power.","i used this in quite a few topics and everyone agreed that it was true, that undervolt is a type of overclock, yet you do not (its fine to object but you dont know both methods even go).",and more to that you confuse power limit with undervolt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thank you, you said it yourself.","intel non k processors are locked from increasing multiplyer or bus clock, which intel calls overclocking.","undervolt, you can do with any board, h610, b660, b760, z690.",when was undervolting not available on some boards?,20 years ago?,"it was always available, apart from plundergate.","so its not the same thing, because one is increasing performance, another is increasing efficiency, with possibility to increase performance.","you seem to be intent on arguing on sematics, and how things are called.","i really dont care man, undervolt and overclock are 2 different things.","my main point, which you still havent proven otherwise, you dont loose performance with correctly done undervolt.","thats a fact, thats what i said, and thats what you argued about.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10 year of cpus like 3570 cannot control the multi at all if its not a zboard.,and were not talking what intel refers to.,ok let me put it this way.,"if stock is 1.1v and you increase above its voltage speed its an overclock, but if you do it on 0.9v above its rated speed its suddenly not an overclock?",logic?,"well whatever, keep not knowing what undervolt truly is.",i tried all i can.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what does multi has to do with anything here?,we are talking about undervolting.,"you can undervolt 3570 just fine, by adjusting voltages, which is not locked on bios.",and  you are talking nonsense again with your examples.,here is your example in normal world: 13600k runs 5.1ghz on p core on default.,"if you undervolt it, it will run same 5.1ghz, but on less energy.",thats undervolt.,"just because it uses less voltage on lesser clockrate, like 4.9ghz, its still undervolt, because its not exceeding its stock clockspeeds.","no matter what undervolt you do, its not gonna go above 5.1ghz, because thats stock multiplyer.","when you actually increase multiplyer, or bus ratio, and it goes over 5.1ghz, thats overclock.","i know perfectly well what undervolt is, you seem to be in your own little world denying what is obvious to everyone.","even the world itself overclock, pretty much explains itself.",its going over the stock clock speed of cpu.,"jeez, its trully hilarious.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"again, what you can and cannot do will depend on the motherboard.","some can, some cannot mine could not.",the claim of undervolt not going above stock speed is not accurate.,"cpus who alter the speed by temperture with undervolt will go above stock speeds, because the algorythm says so.you do realize you cannot maintain the same multi with lower voltage.",all cpus have a voltage/frequency scale that tells if voltage is that the speed should be that (if cpu speed changes with temp it will be a bit different).,"i mentioned this with gpu in mind, since it literally shows points on voltage/frequency (same with cpu).","heres an example for you, auto settings are stock settings, if you decrease the voltage the speed will also be decreased unless you manually change it to its normal speeds that only should exist in higher voltages.",so if auto (that follows stock) setting tells you that lower voltage should run at lower speed and you force it up its not an overclock?,ok,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
getting the same issue.,any luck?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah they are.,itâ€™s a bios glitch.,once you update bios you have to remove your cpu and put it back in and youâ€™ll get the real score.,mine was sp125 then i updated it and removed the cpu and reinstalled it and i got the real sp score of sp103.,on overclockers.,com one of the main ocâ€™ers has tested about 100 chips and the highest real sp he got was 118. he was the one that posted you need to update bios and then remove and reinstall to get actual number.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
flash the latest bios (2103 or 2201beta) and update me firmware.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hey bud ya he messaged me he was able to get the latency down to 60 ns from 70 .,think he's shooting for 50 ns.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how do you even cool a 13900k at 1.45v?,:o are you running direct-die cooling?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so i guess e core sp score does matter even if you disable the e-waste cores and use p cores only but want to overclock p cores as much as possible with lowest voltage and best thermals as possible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah it's probably a pressure issue... many asked if i had a 1700 frame installed and indeed i have one installed... i might give the stock ilm a try and test it out... i swapped my tuf to an apex board and i got 6600 c30 out of a 6000 c40 kit which was like exactly what the previous owner of the mobo/ram achieved with his 12900k...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"but ecores help with performance as they deal with background apps, on raptor lake we keep atleast one ecore on or you lose single core perf.","even alderlake it's suggested to keep them on but they don't allow for max ring frequency, on 13900k i run 5000 ring with 3600 ecores and 5500 pcores",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got 420mm these figures ainâ€™t happening without liquid metal or direct die,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how would you lose any single core performance if e-cores are off.,and why would one e-core help.,"&#x200b;

with e-cores off the 13900k is a super 8 core 16 thread chip quite a bit better in fact than the 7700x as the p cores of intel are better than amd zen 4 at same clock speed and they clock higher too.","update:

well someone over at [overclock.net](https://overclock.net) did say that somehow thee-cores being off totally did hurt single thread performance due to some arch change or arch and having 1 e-core on gets rud of that.",i tested that on win10 and got same exact cpu-z and cinebench single core score so did not see this bug.,"&#x200b;

though here is the thing:

&#x200b;

apparently the thread director causes issues and starts doing everything wrong with e-cores disabled.","&#x200b;

unfortunately you cannot disabled the thread director.","however if you use win10, the thread director is effectively disabled as win10 cannot interact with it.",so this issue appears on 12th gen as well.,so with win10 it should not be a problem at all with all e-cores off on 12th or 13th gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

any pricing increase arguably makes a few skus worse buys.,"take the 13100 vs 12100, right now the indications are going to be a 100mhz clock speed bump.",anything more than 5% price bump in that case makes the 13100 worse value on the cpu alone.,"this isn't even accounting for the motherboard situation in that boards that support the 13100 out of the box will likely be more expensive than those that support the 12100. existing budget b660/h610 boards will not have a bios that supports 13th gen. 

the 13400 vs 12600k is another interesting example.",12600k in many regions (most major ones) are selling below launch rcp now.,"this means any increase in rcp for the 13400 vs the 12400 essentially starts running the price up close to that of the existing 12600k, which will still be faster (10%+ higher clocks) and possibly better in other ways (unlocked sa voltage).",you also avoid the previously mentioned motherboard issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

first: why are you looking at t cpus?,those are designed for systems with extremely limited thermal headroom.,"assuming you know why you want a t cpu, then the next point is that the base speed is essentially an estimate by intel of how fast the cores will run when under an all-core intensive load while maintaining the pl1 power limit of 35w.",it has no other practical bearing on the cpu.,it does not sit there at that speed or something.,it ranges constantly core-by-core from like 400mhz up to maximum turbo.,"so, stick a t cpu in a big desktop case and remove the completely optional power limits, and itâ€™ll maintain the fastest turbo speed indefinitely, assuming your cooling keeps up.","or, take a normal not-t cpu and apply the same arbitrary power limits, and itâ€™ll behave just like a t.

"about that first part, aren't amd's zen 4c and intel srf lineups specifically aimed at those markets?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they have a 4x4 grid of cores, but one of the spots is taken up by other silicon, not a core.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 16th ""tile"" is actually the memory controller.","so a 15 core configuration has all of the tiles active, at least assuming you want the chip to have ram :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""i installed intel xtu, and its settings (especially power limit) are entirely ignored after sleep.","before works fine.""","ok. a brief plan of action:

* uninstall intel xtu (you do not want software oc utility especially if it does not work properly after sleep state).",* boot into bios.,* restore bios defaults.,* turn on xmp.,* turn your cpu cooler fan curve in bios to pretty aggressive during testing.,try again if the crashes continue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they are notoriously hot when running hard core benches like cinebench.,"if you're using it for gaming, turn off hyperthreading in order to test stability.","very few, if any, games use more than 6-8 threads.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"windows 11 is having problems with waking from sleep right now, my guess is that's your problem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unfortunately the same problem existed before xtu.,only tried it because i thought that might be a way to force the limits.,bios reset didn't help either.,all fans+pump are maxed during testing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
change max power in bios to that 250w,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also tried that.,"it has multiple settings for that, tried pretty much every combination possible.","same behavior, works fine on boot, ignored after sleep.",also just wasted most of my day making a fresh windows 11 install.,same behavior there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
c states enable the cpu and even individual cores to go into lower power states when nothing is running on them.,there is no benefit to peak performance when they are disabled.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why do you want to do this?,this sounds like a brute-force solution to a non-existent problem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why would you disable c states?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"disabling c-states is only potentially beneficial in applications that are highly latency-sensitive (e.g,, network packet routing, high frequency trading, etc.","), and also comes with significant trade-offs in terms of power efficiency and overall throughput.","games are not latency-sensitive (with respect to these optimizations), and tweaks like disabling c-states would be counterproductive to game performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
doesn't disabling c states improve your 1% lows in gaming especially in the transition phase between cutscene and gameplay as an example?,idk just genuinely asking because i disable it to overclock on all the k series i have had but that's it really,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cause ive red that when more c states are enabled cpu has more space to rest and so when you lanch a game to play it takes more time to fully wake up from sleep.,so does this somehow impacts performance?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in the past?,yeah.,nowadays?,not sure i've seen tests.,"they've massively improves c state transition latency in server in the last couple generations, i'd bet it's no where near as noticeable on client now either.","c states give significant power savings, so it's an individual tradeoff on energy bill vs a small hit on 1% lows.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"are you thinking that the response times of a cpu exiting sleep mode are like a laptop waking up, so itâ€™s like adding many seconds to anything it does?",a cpu exits c-states as a one time event in a range of nanoseconds to milliseconds for the deepest modes.,just leave this kind of stuff alone.,you will screw up the behavior of your system long before you hit a better combination of power management/performance settings than whatâ€™s stock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
okay so it doesn't hurt performance in any way right?,that's my only point though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"https://rog.asus.com/motherboards/rog-strix/rog-strix-b560-f-gaming-wifi-model/helpdesk_cpu/

yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, but you wonâ€™t be able to overclock 10900k, nor use the top m2 slot which is only reserved for 11th gen. otherwise, you will be able to use it with 10900k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't see why not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
only if you really want to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just so you know you can check out compatably in pc parts picker, just add the parts and it will throw a warning if they donâ€™t work together",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea but you might need a bios update,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can i overclock the 11900k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"man, iâ€™d rather have one less m.2 slot and 2 more cores.",11900k is a joke.,10900/10850k are the best platform chips.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i didn't look at the manual but are you sure the top slot won't just revert to pcie3 with a 10th green cpu installed?,becoming totally disabled doesn't sound right.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you would need a z-series chipset for overclocking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™m not saying they should get 11900k, iâ€™m just mentioning the limitation of the board with a given cpu.",thatâ€™s all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nope, itâ€™s disabled.",doesnâ€™t have enough lanes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
b560 mobos came out after 10th gen came out and sometimes the bios needs to be updated in order to support 10th gen cpus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i see thanks a lot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah sorry i edited my comment.,"i think the 500 series boards are better built than the 400, so imo itâ€™s worth the hit for not getting the *entire* feature set.",also b560 can do xmp and mce.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how do i do that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah but no need to pay premium for pcie4 that you canâ€™t use on 10th gen either.,you really benefit with the 500 boards only if you have 11th gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"forget what i said, i was wrong, it should work out of the box",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
now hereâ€™s the interesting parts.,iâ€™ve only found the 500 boards to be $10-15 more expensive.,"so heck, definitely worth it to me.","example, msi z490 gaming wifi is $150 on amazon, decent board, kinda ugly.","msi z590 unify is $160, amazing board, and i think it subjectively looks better",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i aint built a pc a since 2018 ðÿ˜…,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"eh i guess with 6/700 boards out there, 4/500 boards arenâ€™t popular anymore.","i just remember when it first came out, there were some price differences that didnâ€™t make sense just to get first intel board with pcie4.","now thatâ€™s pretty normal, itâ€™s not really a premium.","also, pcie5/ddr5 stuff is â€œpremiumâ€ and you can tell by price of those boards lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep i completely understand where youâ€™re coming from.,i appreciate the conversation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah for sure, even $10-15 you can use elsewhere for decent upgrade.","faster ram, f cpu to non-f cpu, extra fan, etc.","rather pay for things you can use, not for features you wonâ€™t be able to use anyways!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you'll need to undervolt or put some power limits on it.,"you can scrape by with a 280mm, but if yuou let it run wild without any limits it'll overwhelm that much cooling capacity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how's your temps been on the h115i?,i'm running the same 280mm on 13900k and see about 35-38â°c idle and up to 100â°c on cinebench r23 multicore test.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so far so good.,"when gaming, i usually hit high 70â€™s/low 80â€™s.",thatâ€™s with balanced settings for the pump and fans.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is that 70/80's while gaming or benchmarking?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i wonder if these will also boot standard xeons, would be a good upgrade path down the road.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"looks interesting, hopefully it isnâ€™t as infamous as the last unlocked xeon, the w3175x.",that thing was a complete furnace and required some of the most overbuilt motherboards out there.,along with frying itself sometimes to my knowledge.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"maybe i'm missing something, but those seem like some really terrible scores, especially that single core.","even disregarding threadripper, compared to the intel's previous generation workstation cascade lake (skylake) cpus, this is a really weak showing.","around 10% single core increase, and well below linear scaling for multicore, from the cascade lake xeon-w series, despite having golden cove cores with much higher ipc, the same (or higher) boost clocks, a much higher rated tdp, and ddr5 memory?",the comparison becomes even worse for those thinking about upgrading from the previous hedt 10980xe (cascade lake).,"compared to threadripper, this is just straight up worse (both single and multicore) than the nearly 3 year old 3995wx, let alone the 5995wx.",let's hope whoever leaked this is simply using a gimped setup or this is a serious flop.,"**edit: this is indeed gimped, see post below.",**,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"after checking the original twitter leak (https://twitter.com/benchleaks/status/1618320753794899972), this is indeed a crippled setup.","only reached 3.2 ghz max clock instead of the rated 4.8 ghz boost, and only 56 threads active out of 112. there was no indication of this on the geekbench page which only stated a base/max of 1.9/4.6 ghz and 56 cores.","i'm not sure why they ""leaked"" this severely crippled setup and even put a direct comparison to the mainstream 5800x (how are these two products even remotely comparable?",).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it looks like a bot that just has a default comparison (3070/5800x) for benches it detects.,"generally these are not ""leaks"" as much as they are simply system integrators running quick tests to see how the system is working.",they don't care much other than that it runs and the software qualifies it was error free.,"it's when you start seeing insane numbers of clearly oc'd equipment that are real ""leaks,"" sometimes coming from companies like intel/amd themselves for pr.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how did you get a master key?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whatever is cheaper for them when they bulk buy keys.,my guess is on battle.net but i hope for steam.,"either way, i canâ€™t complain.",it was free.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i bought from bestbuy but haven't recieved an email yet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
anyone know if it is a code to steam or battlenet yet?,hoping steam,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i redeemed everything and it say it worked but it still says pre order in [battle.net](https://battle.net) did i do something wrong or do i have to wait for it to come out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i am writing that i can download a free copy of the game but i do not have any code or link where i can activate the game on my account.,"additionally, their website is barely alive",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

do you know whether i'm allowed to return cpu after i redeem a code?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
buy an intel laptop with a qualifying cpu or buy the cpu itself,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the answer lol i didnt know if it was gonna be on some random launcher or not haha.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wait until it ships,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s battlenet it literally tells you requires a battlenet account and has a link for you to create one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you have to wait.,intel will give you the key on release day which is stupid because [battle.net](https://battle.net) would already lock it from you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was hoping i could change my time-zone on my pc but that didn't work.,"it's still the 27th where i am, 7pm.","what zone are you in, it's already the 28th for you?",maybe intel releases it based on midnight the 28th wherever intel's hq is or something.,says intel is in california so maybe 12am pdt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ve got a redeem option but out of codes :(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not yet.,been trying to load their site properly for 3 - 4 hours now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™m not even able to see the other 2 games anymore, i click on the bundle page and itâ€™s just blank with no options to redeem anything.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
on the intel website thereâ€™s nothing in my downloads and it says already claim for master keys.,battle.net still says pre order and i tried downloading mw2 from battle.net and it says error.,website is also down.,not sure what else there is to do,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it still says temporarily out of codes for me , did u get the game yet?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i keep getting oops something went wrong when i click the here link,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you can login with google it's linked to intel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you get the code once the pc is shipped the company you bought from will email you the master key but intels site is fkd rn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea ä± have the same thing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
boys keep refreshing the website i just got it to work make sure you wait for the redeem now blue button and click it and wait for 5 mins and itll work,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and did the retailer give you the key or did you have to redeem it on intel website?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what happens if i return the cpu after i activate the intel master key?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i doubt it.,activision/blizzard only had the previous 3 cods published through their own launcher.,this year itâ€™s on steam in addition to battlenet but i think thatâ€™s the only 2 platforms.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the laptop or the code?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so technically we won't be able to play the early access ?,doesn't it count as pre-ordering?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same thing for me.,i redeemed my master key and on battle net it still tells me to buy the game.,smh.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my assumption is it'll either be available at launch time or yeah midnight what ever time zone intel picks.,my local time zone is aedt.,"so rubbish from intel, i'm okay with no early access but to not be able to pre-load or be given any intel (excuse the pun)  on when/how the hell we redeem is super disappointing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yes i need this answer too

edit: spelling",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"good question, not sure though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just did this with best buy.,"nothing happens, you keep the code and there's no issues with the returns.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ordered a laptop (asus scar 15"" 2022 edition) from amazon that had the notice about this and amazon is telling me now that the laptop isn't part of the deal.","after i ordered, it said wait 2 days after it shipped for the code.",no code.,"when i contacted amazon support via live chat, that's what they told me :(",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it does not count as a preorder.,i bet you can call up activision and get a beta key if you throw a tantrum.,you can get a beta key if you have xfinity as an internet service provider.,that's how i got.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah i'm in the same boat, but just in case you didn't know i'm pretty sure we have to go back to the intel software offer website and get the game code from there when they let us (should be 12am the 28th or sometime the 28th), then redeem that code on battle net.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you get it working im in the same boat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so when i click redeem offer it says codes temporarily not available ðÿ™„.,"however, now the website is down.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
click â€œhereâ€,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah the website is fkd atm i have done all the shit but on battle net its stuck on this game is currently not avalible its got the install button but its dark blue not highlighted to download it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it actually worked for me.,"it was down for maintenance for a while, but it started working and i was able to download the game (still had to refresh a few times for it to load without errors though).",guess they just don't care enough to have a capable server for a promo website,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah intel messaged me back saying they are trying to fix it aye,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"got it, much appreciated ðÿ‘",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think you will get the answer on oct 28. they might check it then.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is the email from best buy?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so amazon sent me an email after i went on live chat with an amazon rep about my issue.,they gave me a master key and told me to sign up on the intel website.,"so if you don't get your master key, make sure you contact best buy's support so you don't miss out on the free game(s).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wait seriously?,how's it not considered a preorder?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i was doing some research and i believe youâ€™re right.,says my game is available on the 28th which would be midnight (est) for me.,sucks that we can pre download it though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got it to work last night at 8:30 pm central time.,maybe the intel site is over loaded,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is just to connect my [battle.net](https://battle.net) account to intel account .. i connected it and then it redirect me back to the same page with the same text and same everything ..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

itâ€™s already on my intel account as claimed - iâ€™ve done this before with games like bf 2042 and it has worked without any issues.,theyâ€™re multi-billion dollar corporations - they really couldnâ€™t care less if you get the game or not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, from best buy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
im in the same boat from sydney australia is it stuck on 'you cant install this game yet' launch was 3pm aest but for the intel code do we have to wait till 12am?,considering buying the game hahaha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thatâ€™s strange, for me it refreshed the page to which the redeem button appeared.",now iâ€™m not even getting what you shared earlier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my redeem full worked like a month ago for the beta and i could play.,maybe they ran out of keys or some shit fkn annoying that we cant play on launch day idk whether to just buy the game on steam or not,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"hereâ€™s a hot take:

i wouldnâ€™t want meteor lake anyway.",itâ€™s going to be intelâ€™s first non monolithic die cpu for consumer desktop on a brand new process.,the raptor lake refresh will probably be the best option until arrow lake comes out on the intel 3 process node.,"raptor lake is a really good cpu, itâ€™s as good as it gets at the moment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
honestly now is a great time to upgrade to ddr5 as many of the new server refreshes will be ddr5 platforms and the demand will be much higher.,i built a 13900k with gskill 7200s and a pcie4.0 ssd and you are smoking crack if you think your ddr3 platform is faster.,how much ram do you even have?,8gb?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

c states enable the cpu and even individual cores to go into lower power states when nothing is running on them.,there is no benefit to peak performance when they are disabled.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why do you want to do this?,this sounds like a brute-force solution to a non-existent problem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why would you disable c states?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"disabling c-states is only potentially beneficial in applications that are highly latency-sensitive (e.g,, network packet routing, high frequency trading, etc.","), and also comes with significant trade-offs in terms of power efficiency and overall throughput.","games are not latency-sensitive (with respect to these optimizations), and tweaks like disabling c-states would be counterproductive to game performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
doesn't disabling c states improve your 1% lows in gaming especially in the transition phase between cutscene and gameplay as an example?,idk just genuinely asking because i disable it to overclock on all the k series i have had but that's it really,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cause ive red that when more c states are enabled cpu has more space to rest and so when you lanch a game to play it takes more time to fully wake up from sleep.,so does this somehow impacts performance?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in the past?,yeah.,nowadays?,not sure i've seen tests.,"they've massively improves c state transition latency in server in the last couple generations, i'd bet it's no where near as noticeable on client now either.","c states give significant power savings, so it's an individual tradeoff on energy bill vs a small hit on 1% lows.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"are you thinking that the response times of a cpu exiting sleep mode are like a laptop waking up, so itâ€™s like adding many seconds to anything it does?",a cpu exits c-states as a one time event in a range of nanoseconds to milliseconds for the deepest modes.,just leave this kind of stuff alone.,you will screw up the behavior of your system long before you hit a better combination of power management/performance settings than whatâ€™s stock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
okay so it doesn't hurt performance in any way right?,that's my only point though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm not 100% sure so don't take this as a fact, but i'm guessing it acts like a power target rather than a hard limit or something similar

like maybe instead of using as much power is available to say, watch a youtube video, maybe it will sivert less power to that instead 

or lowering frequencies more for idle use to draw less power, and on that note, maybe effecting the way your boost behaves, and instead of hitting the max frequency it can based on it's temperature and hard power limit, maybe running a little lower when not required, ect 

i can smell the downvotes already because i can tell i'm just saying random bullshit lmao",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there are three options: balance, maximum performance, maximum battery life.","so my first guess would be: this power plans only affect the integrated gpu, and if my pc has a discrete graphics card, it won't be that much of affect?",so should i set it on max battery when using the laptop battery since morden igpus are good enough for watching videos/online meetings even without full power?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to be honest ,i tried on uhd 620 ,and i didn't see any difference ,may be the igpu is weak enough so that it didn't reflect any change ðÿ˜‚ðÿ˜‚ðÿ˜‚",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"could just control the power budget between the cpu/gpu, skylake gpus might also have something like speedshift to decide clocks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"click start, type ""edit power plan"" and hit enter.","then click on ""change advanced power settings.""",from this screen you can see a detailed list of what each power plan actually does and even adjust them if you wish.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's not related to the graphics.,"it decides how the cpu cores are clocked, what the base clocks would be and how high and frequently it would clock up.",performance mode keeps the core clocks high and the other two keep them low.,intel itself only recommends balanced because it usually works the best and performance mode barely improves the performance for the battery cost.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"oh, probably the whole cpu chip since i don't see why they would have different power modes for something that sips less power than an electric car sips gasoline",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i also thought of that for a moment, but then there is power mode in settings, power plans in control panel.",wouldn't day contradict with the power setting in graphic center?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think this power plan can override the one built into windows but not sure but they essentially do the same thing.,"as to why it's in the graphics command center, no clue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

older cpus had square ihs.,the ilm of the supported boards did not produce enough torque to bend them enough to affect cooling.,12th gen and 13th gen cpus have rectangular ihs.,the distance from ilm's contact and the edges of the cpus are bigger.,thus giving more leverage for bending.,"and that is enough to cause lack of contact between ihs and cooler's cold plate, resulting in higher temps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

because the older cpu sockets were physically smaller and more square and as such didn't have the issue of unequal retention pressure.,similar frames did exist but they were mostly used for direct die cooling or other exotic options.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

mostly wondering because i brought a parts not working maximus extreme fairly cheap and it is half missing 2 pins but still works with dual channel ram.,i was wondering if those 2 pins are ground because it would be nice if they are.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for providing me with the link.,i have looked at the pdf but i can't seem to find the excel file.,where is the excel file located?,which page is it on?,thanks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for this.,just saved me a  motherboard.,i fat-fingered two of the pins in the cpu socket when installing the cpu.,one of them bent back almost perfectly and the other broke off when i tried to fix it.,i was so pissed at myself that when the system didn't post i instantly blamed it on the broken pin and ordered a new motherboard and started researching how much i could sell this one for for parts on ebay.,"but after looking up the diagram and realizing they were both ground pins, i started thinking again.",problem: i pulled the cpu out of my gaming rig so i could upgrade it to a 13th gen. failed to remember that i bought a kf for it.,definitely explains the lack of video output.,two stupid moves in one day.,maybe it's a good thing that i can't get a new cpu until tomorrow!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you could always check with a multimeter...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's not on a page.,it's a separate excel file attached or embedded to the pdf.,your pdf viewer should have a paper clip icon or something that should let you view pdf attachments.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i had to open it with actual adobe reader, but can confirm the attachments are there.",for me the paperclip icon was on the left edge of the window.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i suppose that is an option although i do not have one right now.,thanks for the suggestion.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hi yes, i have found it.",according to the excel sheet i'm missing a vccgt pin ac46 and a vss pin ac45.,ac46 is said to be cpu power.,i have not tried any overclocking on the cpu just xmp on the ram.,ac45 is said to be gnd which is ground so that shouldn't really cause a problem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">my understanding is that, if i'm constraining the processor by limiting its power (and all other things being equal), the only variable then becomes ipc,

no that's not correct.","the variable is efficiency, not ipc.","the 12600k has more cores and access to efficiency cores, so it will be significantly faster at a fixed power limit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1t i would say the k will boost higher so even with a power limit k chip will be faster in games and single thread apps.,"nt my guess is e cores are more power efficient, by using the e cores you probably get more multi core performance with same 65w power limit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as a individual core's frequency increases, its efficiency decreases.",what this means is that having 10 (or 14) cores sharing 65 watts means each of them can run more efficiently than they would if you only had 6 cores sharing the same power budget.,"the size of this effect obviously depends on the exact conditions, but you will see a benefit in multithreaded performance with increasing core count, even without increasing tdp.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
single-core loads do not reach 65w so performance will only depend on the boost clock.,"for multi-core loads, golden cove is most efficient when operating \~3-4w/core.","unless the core count is so high or the power limit is so low that each core gets less than that, you will see performance benefits from higher core count parts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pl 125w cinebench r23 score 24k.,pl 65w 19k.,i donâ€™t know whatâ€™s the score for 12400f tho.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i would suspect the 12600k at 65w would perform better, it is also more expensive... i have a 12400f (from 6700nonk) that i bought for 179 euro - great cpu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12400f consumes by default about 75w in cinebechat 4ghz all-core.,i guess at 65w you will see small to no difference with 12600k in this kind of conditions.,gaming is very different story though.,power consumption is much less and there will be a difference.,i canâ€™t say it will be noticeable though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's a good point, actually (efficiency, not ipc).",thanks for pointing that out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's true - i guess the k parts should be better binned by default so able to do more with a given amount of power (as per another poster: efficiency, not ipc).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hey sorry to both you!,"in another thread you said "" on idle my 5600x consumes 18-20w of power.",15 for the soc and 3-5w for the idle cores.,"considering the whole chipped is capped at 75w i think this is a lot.""",i'm assuming you checked this in hwinfo.,"i define idle as about 10% cpu usage, so like 20 chrome tabs already open and a youtube video playing at 1080p.",can you double check your cpu package wattage under these conditions?,do you have any special settings to get wattage that low or is it stock?,what ram do you have - is xmp on?,if you have time to check that it would help me a lot in deciding if i can afford the power draw of that cpu.,thank you!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
huh.,interesting - hadn't considered that.,"i suppose that, in retrospect, i should have specified that the primary usage for this pc will be gaming, and therefore (unless things have changed recently in this respect...?","), single-core usage will be more important.",does that change the calculus somewhat?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
golden cove?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'll have to look but i'm pretty sure one of the big review sites (tpu, i believe) had, in their review of the 12400, some power-limited data in their charts, so that's actually quite useful, thanks!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just looked at it.,"if those numbers are correct, there would indeed seem to be a massive difference.","[https://www.techspot.com/review/2392-intel-core-i5-12400/](https://www.techspot.com/review/2392-intel-core-i5-12400/)

12400 pl to 65w on cb r23 is 11621.  that's a crazy delta.","edit: i know there's probably other variables that could influence that score, but still, on the whole, this is still getting in the realm of double the performance at the same pl.",insane.,"guess i'll have to look at the 13600k then, for future-proofing if nothing else.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, that's the question - better, yes, but worth the extra money?","mind you, canada computers had a pretty good sale on 12600kf's right now, i might go for that too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there's the bigger cache too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"most games these days aren't entirely single core bound, but they do benefit from a few fast cores more than a bunch of slower cores.","and for gaming, power consumption tends to not be too high anyway.","if a game consumes more than 65 watts when running on a 13600k, it's probably not much more.","for your situation, i'd just look at benchmarks comparing the 12400 and the 13600k in gaming and see if the price difference is worth it to you, ignoring tdp restraints.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the core architecture of the performance cores in both processors.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hi.,just saw that youâ€™re mainly gaming.,iâ€™ll suggest you to check out the youtube game benchmarks.,"difference in 1440 is very minimal, like 5-10%, between the 2 cpus, even tho in cb r23 got a crazy delta like that.","but i agree with you, i chose 13600kf for future proofing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
does that translate into measurable performance gains?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">ignoring tdp restraints

but - doesn't ignoring those restraints invalidate the conclusions of the comparison given my projected use case...?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i see, thank you.",wasn't aware of that particular bit of nomenclature.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, i was looking at some of those benchmarks and est having the same thought.",i game at 3840x1600 so i'll most likely be gpu bound anyway....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well an extreme example would be 5800x3d vs 5800x.there was an article/video(don't recall the source sorry) showcasing the differences between a 12900k vs the other skus with all things being equal except the cache by disabling cores manually and there was a measurable difference.,not huge mind you but the more the better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 13600k averages [about 75 watts](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/intel-core-i5-13600k/22.html) while gaming.,restricting power to 65 watts will not meaningfully change the results.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah, i see.",thank you!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it may be related to hdcp (copy protection).,does it work when one display is plugged directly into the igpu output and the app is active on that same monitor?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes that works, but i wouldn't call it ideal at all.",anyway to get the hdcp to pass through from the intel igpu to the nvidia?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"whoops, didn't see your followup.","no, not that i know of.",the display essentially has to have full direct custody of the source gpu to allow hdcp to remain enabled.,"passing that output over the pcie bus to the dgpu breaks the chain, so to speak.","if the secondary display is mostly for video output and random tasks, i'd leave it connected to the igpu and see if it's livable.",there shouldn't be any major performance difference for 2d/ui tasks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you could remove it and use isopropyl alcohol to wipe the sticker residue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

lol those arenâ€™t pins.,itâ€™s fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
soak it in pure alcohol to ease removal of the sticker.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
*update* - just heard back from the online store i bought it from and they advised me not to remove it and that it won't affect anything to keep it there.,so i guess that's what i'll do.,thanks for the replies everyone!,was close to getting the rubbing alcohol out but it honestly looks like a bitch to remove and i don't want to risk damaging something under it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"like others have said, it's not on any pins.","but, most intel cpus don't have pins on the actual unit.",the pins are in the socket.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it likely won't matter.,"it's not stuck to pins because 1) there are no pins on the cpu, those are on the mobo and 2) the pads on the cpu are the little gold dots on the outside.","the sticker is covering components on the cpu, mostly capacitors.",these don't connect to the board.,that square in the center is just open on the mobo socket.,"i, personally would remove the sticker.",it's not supposed to be there.,a pair of tweezers should be able to easily peel it off and the residue can safely be removed with a q-tip and some isopropyl alcohol.,i recommend 90% or better as it has less water.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"\-peel it off as well as you can

\-put a little goo gone on anything that remains, let it sit for a couple minutes

"it doesn't matter, no pins contact that part of the cpu but it also looks incredibly easy to take off with your finger nail or tweezers, so idk why you can't remove it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the sticker won't affect anything.,"if anything, it'll just fall off on its own after you use the cpu due to the heat.",there's just empty air there anyway on the socket too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they also writ on the sticker when placed after on cpu or before?,i definitely remove the sticker and check underneath.,"i never seen this, so it pisses me off.",i would be pissed off if i bought this.,hammer time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
im running a pc with that sticker inside for 8 years not a single problem.,that's completely fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's just covering resistors, but i'd still try to remove it because it might burn.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"like most people say, this is fine and doesnâ€™t influence anything.",itâ€™s usually used by certain sellers to mark for warranty purposes.,i personally would advise you to remove it if it doesnâ€™t affect your warranty from the seller.,there have been some shady sellers use it to cover up missing capacitors located there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it should be fine to use the processor as is, but if you're worried, use some alcohol to loosen the adhesive without damaging the processor.",might be a good idea since the processor will likely get hot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"those are not pins, sir",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your bigger issue is that that marking only appears on es and qs samples -- this is almost certainly not a retail model.,this is a grey-market chip.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it should be fine but iâ€™d definitely remove it if it was me for heat reasons.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mainly no-contact components in the center  (caps).,"iâ€™d still remove it as paper blocks heat, so will impede heat distribution for the center of the chip.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"great, thank you!",so leaving that sticker on (not that i can easily remove it) should be okay?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nope, those are pads.",pins are in the socket.,edit: by â€žthoseâ€œ i mean â€žthe things on the outsideâ€œ.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
those are pads.,the pins are in the socket.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"those power delivery components can hit upto 100â°c, and that sticker might hamper thermal dissipation.","most cpus have temp sensors only in the cores so you might not be aware itâ€™s cooking & lowering lifespan :/

don't listen to anyone who tells you it's going to be fine.,its absolutely not fine.,do a simple google search on an intel 12th gen cpu and see if you can find one that has a sticker on the same spot as yours.,you won't find any.,remove it before installing!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"nope, those are components.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the question is why bother if it doesn't come off easily?,"i'd probably warm it up slightly with a hairdryer to soften the glue and clean it up with isopropyl alcohol personally, but if op doesn't want to tinker with it, there really is no reason to do anything.",it won't have any impact on the functionality of the cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just because intel didn't put it there doesn't mean it's hurting anything.,if it's easy to remove then remove it.,if it's a pain in the ass then just leave it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is absolutely fine.,what do you think the problem is?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you got a point, but also it seems intel don't care about their coolers, the 13700 and 12900 are basically the same but the cooler of 12900 is larger compared one shipped with 13700, i'd be throwing money out buying that stock cooler",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"its nothing to do with the coolers, people are also getting 100c on multiple rad custom loops.",the stock voltages are set through the roof with no explanation or acknowledgement from intel why they decided to do this.,the stock ihs is basically incapable of transferring the heat to any cooling solution used.,we know this because all these issues also completely vanish when people have delidded and used direct die cooling instead.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you have thermal headroom?,turn it on and test for yourself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
find out what your limits are (pl1 and pl2) and use throttlestop to set them to lower values than what your system manufacturer has set.,that should bypass dynamic tuning.,intel recommends not turning dynamic tuning off.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

older cpus had square ihs.,the ilm of the supported boards did not produce enough torque to bend them enough to affect cooling.,12th gen and 13th gen cpus have rectangular ihs.,the distance from ilm's contact and the edges of the cpus are bigger.,thus giving more leverage for bending.,"and that is enough to cause lack of contact between ihs and cooler's cold plate, resulting in higher temps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they had similar enthusiast level products.,"similar to contact frames, they are not necessary.",the extreme enthusiasts delidded and direct die mounted their processors using delid die guards.,"or, simply used liquid metal and a copper ihs.",now what intel uses to mount the ihs is actually decent so delidding is less worth it but the longer cpu size makes a contact frame more effective.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because the older cpu sockets were physically smaller and more square and as such didn't have the issue of unequal retention pressure.,similar frames did exist but they were mostly used for direct die cooling or other exotic options.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

whats your cooling setup?,id like at least a 240mm aio (a 360 wont fit my chasis) but im fearful that a $420 cpu and whatever $300 fan i get wont be enough to keep the thing cool if idk how to tweak something.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
currently i have the artic liquid freezer 2 360 aio.,"frankly i was expecting temps to be slightly better with it, as it seems to be a top 3 in the aio market.","i will say it is extremely quiet though, even when running at its fastest speed, the pump is silent and artics p-series fans are much more silent than any case fans i've ever had.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
donâ€™t use high performance power plan.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"use balanced power plan, also check if there are any programs in the background that is putting your cpu in constant load.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wait, all of the cores are hitting 5.8ghz?!","if that's the case, your motherboard is applying some funky settings.",check for any auto-overclocking features and disable them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yep.,"according to the intel spec sheet, it supports pcie 4.0 and 5.0 https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/134586/intel-core-i512400-processor-18m-cache-up-to-4-40-ghz.html",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intel ark or google is always the answer to these types of questions :-d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm not 100% sure so don't take this as a fact, but i'm guessing it acts like a power target rather than a hard limit or something similar

like maybe instead of using as much power is available to say, watch a youtube video, maybe it will sivert less power to that instead 

or lowering frequencies more for idle use to draw less power, and on that note, maybe effecting the way your boost behaves, and instead of hitting the max frequency it can based on it's temperature and hard power limit, maybe running a little lower when not required, ect 

i can smell the downvotes already because i can tell i'm just saying random bullshit lmao",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there are three options: balance, maximum performance, maximum battery life.","so my first guess would be: this power plans only affect the integrated gpu, and if my pc has a discrete graphics card, it won't be that much of affect?",so should i set it on max battery when using the laptop battery since morden igpus are good enough for watching videos/online meetings even without full power?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to be honest ,i tried on uhd 620 ,and i didn't see any difference ,may be the igpu is weak enough so that it didn't reflect any change ðÿ˜‚ðÿ˜‚ðÿ˜‚",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"could just control the power budget between the cpu/gpu, skylake gpus might also have something like speedshift to decide clocks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"click start, type ""edit power plan"" and hit enter.","then click on ""change advanced power settings.""",from this screen you can see a detailed list of what each power plan actually does and even adjust them if you wish.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's not related to the graphics.,"it decides how the cpu cores are clocked, what the base clocks would be and how high and frequently it would clock up.",performance mode keeps the core clocks high and the other two keep them low.,intel itself only recommends balanced because it usually works the best and performance mode barely improves the performance for the battery cost.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"fun fact: on every pc i've had, if i let my cpu use 100% of its power, it will stay on 100% all the time.","but if you put it to 99% power as its maximum output, it will use the correct amount.",so put the least to 1% and the max to 99%,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for sharing!,iâ€™m still wondering if that option only control igpu (since itâ€™s in the graphic center) or the whole cpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would imagine this is actually the power plan for your entire computer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you want/need the extra battery life, definitely keep it on max battery when unplugged, chances are you won't notice a big enough difference to disable that anyway if you're just using it to watch or stream videos and basic workloads",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes when i played around the power plans, i noticed there is a section to control the intel graphic powerâ€¦wondering if thatâ€™s the same thing as in the graphic command center",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so i guess my question would be: since it controls the whole cpu, why would it be in the graphic commend center?",and how is it different from power mode & power plans?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh, probably the whole cpu chip since i don't see why they would have different power modes for something that sips less power than an electric car sips gasoline",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i also thought of that for a moment, but then there is power mode in settings, power plans in control panel.",wouldn't day contradict with the power setting in graphic center?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think this power plan can override the one built into windows but not sure but they essentially do the same thing.,"as to why it's in the graphics command center, no clue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it probably changes both.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"any ram setting other than 3200 ddr4 and 5600 ddr5 for 13th gen voids the warranty, intel support won't even know what gears are.","if it had anything at all to do with the imc freqency, then 3200 ddr4 = 6400 ddr5 for the imc, but intel only officially support 5600.

good news is they never have to know, just don't ever mention anything relating to ram xmp or overclocking to intel support, if ever you need cpu support and they want to to run tests / upload screenshots, just set the ram to auto jedec before hand.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i ran into similar issues with my 9900kf and went a different route.,i set the maximum turbo boost limit to 4.5ghz (as opposed to the default 4.7ghz).,this downclock allows my temps to max out at 85c rather than hitting 100c in prime95.,gaming & 3d mark performance yields the same results with the 200mhz loss.,i had to reset cmos multiple times in order to post when i was trying it the way you are.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i was sure i read that intel had blocked undervolting of their newer cpu's, a quick google shows this-

'tldr: undervolting is a feature of unlocked cpus.","it decreases power consumption, lowers temperatures, and improves performance by reducing cpu voltages.","this feature was blocked in the recent intel microcode update, distributed with new bios versions.","it affects alder lake (12th gen) and raptor lake (13th gen) cpus.16 jan 2023'

ok but your not understanding me.,you say there's 10 + cases.,"i go to google and type in ""13900k degradation"" and nothing pops up.",i click your link and all its talking about is people overclocking their cpu and what settings they do.,"at no point do i see anyone say ""i was at stock and my cpu degraded"" like wtf are you talking about.",mce on 13th gen only unlocks power limits.,"it does nothing to voltage like gigabyte is with their ""instant 6ghz""  option

oh so the vrms degraded that fast?,nah man.,this is normal behavior for cpus.,"they experience rapid degradation when you first get them (my 5ghz and 4.9ghz losses in the first few weeks) then depending on the voltage you hit them with, they degrade over time.",these modern chips having to face 1.5v is absolutely absurd and will result in dead chips well within their lifespan.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
where exactly did i say 'at stock with no overclocking'?,asus mce / gigabyte auto oc is not stock with no overclocking!,gigabyte shoving 1.5v into these chips for 6.0 on two cores is not stock with no overclocking.,what exactly is wrong with your reading comprehension?,"all the cases of degradation so far are with far less than 1.5v core voltage which this gigabyte feature is doing, and likely also less than whatever asus mce puts through them, i mean you are literally commenting in a thread about overclocking these chips to 6.0, not about running them at stock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's just absolutely not true.,intel 14nm could handle voltages like that just fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dude.,mce lifts power limits.,while considered an overclock i would consider it stock since they ship it default.,now.,mce only lifts power limits.,it does not raise core voltage.,so when you said.,mce and anything over 253 watts will degrade your chip.,i call bullshit.,"&#x200b;

if you raise voltage and oc then yeah of course your going to degrade your chip and shorten lifespan faster.",but what ?,your going from 10-15 years to 8-10 years lifespan?,come on man.,its like your fear mongering,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is true.,if a 65nm chip could experience much more degradation at 1.5v then a 14nm one which has far less atoms per transistor is going to experience electromigration even faster.,and my experience with this 7700k proves that to be true.,i didn't even push super hard with insane workloads and it still lost stability at previously good voltages multiple times.,"it's reality, it's physics and there's no avoiding it.","seriously go look into electromigration, read up on it and understand what it is.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would be surprised if this was not the same user in that thread claiming widespread degradation(widespread?,nope.),when in reality seeing changes in overclocks and performance is likely to be some other reason.,you can get a better sense of degradation rates after multiple years and many samples.,people on overclock.net can think themselves to be cpu engineers because they bios gud.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

plenty of availability here in japan.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s to be expected.,the i5-13600k draws about 150-190w under full all-core load.,thatâ€™s *much* more than any low-profile cooler is capable of dissipating.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

they're slightly different.,the uhd has the same 3d pipeline but adds hardware decode for a couple extra video codecs/formats.,otherwise they're essentially the same thing.,op's problem sounds like drivers to me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your t470s has a maximum bandwith of 5gb/s over usb-c and the t490s has one usb-c port that can do 10gb/s.,"the t490s should be able to drive the most things through your dock, in theory.","however which displayport and hdmi standard are being used will also play a part in this, the higher the standard the more bandwith you'll need.","the maximum number of displays that your intel hd or uhd can handle is three, but as intel states on their website this can be limited by manufacturers.",so perhaps you're running into an artificial limit imposed by lenovo here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yes, although i have to say i am running ""enforce all limits"" (253w).",which means if someone triggers a 24 core 100% stress/torture test it will clock down with a small penalty.,but in every other case 24/7 the cpu runs at all core 5.8 ghz and e core 4.5 ghz butter smooth.,in gaming its sweet!,because i still run some games that only run on a few cores like ex.,starcraft ii with my son in 120hz 4k- so there the 5.8 also gives a great benefit.,overall its an epic setting imo.,"at the end of the day i dont really care if i can run cinebench ""unlimited"".","everything i do- gaming, widows etc.",the cpu runs amazing 5.8/4.5.,but of corse i will admit a 100% workload on 24 cores would downclock with a little penalty.,but its rock stable and super cool and butter smooth this way.,and i never run into a scenario where i need 24 cores at 100%.,in regular use and or gaming the cpu will never downclock from the 5.8/4.5.,edit: forgot to say this setting also works great before my cooling mods!,you should try it!,;),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

haha yes !,and thanks!,its because my son is obsessed with it haha!,"its his favorite game, he plays it every day!",i think it has something to do with we played it a lot together when he was a little kid on the lap and of corse its a great game they updated a long with time.,but then he forced me back into co-op with him haha!,":) the thing is for me that after i recently moved to 120hz and 42"" oled (came from 60hz) it gave new life for me as well haha!",i have never seen the game run like this!,its quite amazing it still holds up!,but the old engine 4k 120 is quite something haha!,i say to mike my son ..  miiiike its too fast for your old dad!,but we manage anyway haha!,":)  but the game unfortunately relies on heavy cpu in 1440p / 4k ultra and basically only a few cores.. and even my previous 10900k 5 ghz would not be able to hold very high frame rates at times, but this alder lake/ raptor lake is amazing on a few cores only its can hold 120fps almost all the time.","you remember the baneling level, it was a killer!",we ran it butter smooth the other day totally impressed both!,:) normally it laggs totally with all these units exploding haha!,and my son he got a 12600k we ocâ´ed to 5 ghz so he also run 120hz.,hehe .. so its quite fun!,before his computer in multiplayer could drag mine down so its win win haha!,:)  also because some incredible dude made all 3 campaigns custom for co-op with modified maps and balanced harder so it works for 2 player.,i have to admit its quite cool!,;) so now we are in the zerg campaign!,:)  but last level terran campaign against the queen of zerg co-op was amazing and difficult!,;) you know this was also a time where they really made these games epic with the storylines.,"i mean jim, kerrigan, zeratul and all the others are just epic!",:)  a shame blizzard is not blizzard anymore... imagine a starcraft 3!,;)  but no doubt its king rts.,happy to hear you are also a fan!,":)

its a combination of intense competition between amd/intel for marketshare and the general trend of cpus not improving as fast as they did 10 or 15 years ago which means even low end parts often age pretty well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the single thread performance of a specific range of processors is usually pretty similar throughout the range.,"there's some clock speed differences, but the faster clocked high end parts are basically being pre-overclocked these days and dont usually get linear performance gains through these faster clock speeds.","or put more simply, the main, meaningful difference between lower end parts and higher end parts is core counts.","you also tend to get more l3 cache, which does matter, but the difference isn't game changing most of the time.","so yes, the architecture is the main factor that makes lower end parts still be 'good'.","a 13100 is only four core, but those are four very powerful cores.","that said, unless you're just *very* budget restrained, i'd still recommend going with a six core part at minimum if you want something that will last you a good while.","cpu demands go up over time, and there will be more and more situations where having six or more cores proves very beneficial.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is because a large majority of the demanding things an average hobbyist uses a computer for are just gaming.,"outside of gaming, demanding software is almost all professional stuff where the cost doesn't matter that much.",so there's no point to talk about spec.,just buy what their budget allows.,"inside of gaming, it is almost all about the gpu.","long as your cpu is the most recent, even low ends one will work fine for almost all games.","and they are right, it will play the game just fine.",it will **operate**.,"when you want it to do better than just the minimum, that is where the real discussion goes.",by that time you generally have some ideas now pair well together.,"and if you don't, at least you know which title you are playing and have somewhere to start doing research.",that's why you don't need to worry about it too much.,when you need something you will know it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh very thanks for this explanation, was planning on buying a 14100 and thinking that might keep me content for a very long while since i'm not a multitasking type person; or gaming aaa games for that matter.","i think i'm still fine with buying one, i hope i won't regret it.","overwatch and pubg's fine with me, and a bit of blender 3d stuff.",very budget restrained is my case that's unfortunately right.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh yea, if you're not into aaa gaming or anything, you'll be good.","not that it cant still do aaa gaming alright right now(especially at 60fps), but it'll be more limited over time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the game menus have fps caps?,vsync turned on?,the menus running at hundreds of fps?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"unless you have performance issues in gaming, then there is no problem.","cpu is pretty ancient though, i would consider upgrading when you can.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
those are cpu intensive games.,the cpu works very hard loading levels and textures.,it shouldnâ€™t really worry you unless you get very high temps or really bad lags.,nonetheless monitor it using msi afterburner software.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i myself am using i3 10105f,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you upgraded your gpu recently?,which gpu do you have?,"try playing at a higher resolution to shift the bound from cpu to gpu, also try limiting your fps to the amount you're comfortable with, rather than have it uncapped, check if there is background app using the cpu.","the cpu is pretty old, so it makes sense for it to be bottlenecking but unless you are dissatisfied with the performance or find it hard to keep the thermal under control, it is perfectly fine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
donâ€™t worry about your processor.,itâ€™s dope.,just monitor your fps in msi afterburner.,and tell me what fps are you getting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cap it to your refresh rate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes i have tried all that but it is still at 100 cpu usage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so its normal for my fan to be going on like max to cool it down as well?,sorry if its a dumb question since ive never had any games make my pc hit 100 cpu usage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have not upgraded my gpu, i have a rtx 2060 super.",no but the problem is i was running the game at like 20 cpu usage before and just recently it began to shoot up to 100% cpu usage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i did that but still using a lot of cpu, but the weird thing is that there were no problems a couple months ago but all of a sudden overwatch 2 started using a lot of cpu when playing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"when the gpu/cpu reaches higher temps set by either you or the factory it has to cool down and come below those temps because they are designed that way so that they donâ€™t burn themselves out, so they do it either by increasing the fan speed or by decreasing the voltage as electricity produces heat.","the latter negatively affects the performance and you might get sudden frame drops, lags and stutters.",to counter this just provide enough ventilation/airflow and set the temp limit and fan speed to the max.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i found a fix.,"&#x200b;

try to change to borderless window and change it back to fullscreen window.",100% cpu usage is now fix,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you're referring to the 'product line suffix' and 'k' simply indicates that the chip is unlocked, supports overclocking, and has integrated graphics.","as such intel usually squeezes out a little bit more stock power from the k variants, but you wouldn't notice a difference unless you ran it through benchmark software.","although looking at the multi-core performance scores between the 13700 and 13700k, its somewhat significant.",i've never seen a \~15% gap like that.,the 13700k might be something of a special unicorn.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there is nothing ""crippled"" or ""defective"" about this part.","when they manufacture the silicon wafer, not all parts come out with the same level of working components.",the best parts are chosen for the higher end models and the rest are chosen for the subsequently lower models in the range.,this is a standard industry practice and ensures very little of the silicon wafer is wasted.,the 13700 silicon is very close in quality to the 13700k but not so close that it could have just been packaged to be sold as a 13700k.,it can hit clock speeds that are within 100mhz of the k model.,the lack of overclocking support is just an artificial limitation to justify spending extra on the k model.,the base clocks you quoted are largely irrelevant and are deliberately lower to achieve the lower base power of the 13700 but both will reach more or less the same turbo power under load.,"for all intents and purposes, the two will perform the same under most testing conditions.",and the fact that you can buy the 13700 and basically get 13700k performance makes the 13700k the scam.,"this has been true for many generations, which is usually why the non k models arrive later after enough people are duped into buying the overpriced k models that they rarely, if ever, overclock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't pay attention to base frequency.,the maximum frequency is [lower by 100-200mhz which you'll never notice.,"](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/compare.html?productids=230490,230500) the power doesn't mean anything as it can be set by the motherboard.",there aren't any reviews that i've seen so far but for 12th gen it was a negligible difference in performance for a lower cost.,but if it's $10-15 then it doesn't really matter anyway.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's possible the 13700k is better binned.,"in other words, the 13700 didn't meet the chip quality/performance requirements of the 13700k and sold as a 13700 instead.","this is binning, and is quite common in this industry.","for example, there are some rare unicorn chips of the ryzen 5800x that have two core complexes, likely just a failed ryzen 5900/5950x.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they have essentially the same clockspeed and power consumption (within a couple percent).,the difference is that the k is unlocked while the non-k includes a heatsink in the box.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thank you a lot for the reply, very insightful.","i'm going to delete my op post though, because i got downvoted for asking stupid questions, and i don't like to look stupid, so i'll sweep it under the carpet :)

just wanted to let you know i appreciate the help.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah.,it's a by-product of the extremely small manufacturing process from both chip manufacturers.,the non-k and non-x chips are basically k and x chips with slight manufacturing defects that keep them from hitting spec.,"as long as these defects still exist, and they don't have a good way of recycling the silicon, i'll take this approach instead of even more e-waste coming out of these plants.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks, that's what i needed to double check on.","yes, but selling a ""defective"" product at just â‚¬10 ""discount"" doesn't sound very nice to me.",they could drop the price down a bit more.,"i mean, even if i don't want to overclock, i would rather pay extra â‚¬10 for a product that meets the highest quality criteria.","so, are there any downsides to 13700 (non-k), except that i can't overclock it?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you already have a heatsink and you can get the same price then no reason to buy the non-k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

look at the photo of this post - thatâ€™s a contact frame.,"instead of default bracket that locks your cpu in place people often are using the contact frame, because the stock one might bend your cpu ihs in the middle and result you in not having enough contact between ihs and the heatsink - hence high temps.","it doesnâ€™t apply to all cpus, but itâ€™s a pretty common issue on 12/13th gen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you should be able to use any cooler because you normally remove the original paste or solder and replace it with better paste or liquid metal and then put the original ihs back on.,before reinstalling the ihs you can lap it to make sure it has the best contact as possible with the cooler's cold plate.,this requires determining if the cold plate is concave/convex/flat and then lapping the ihs to mate to it.,or instead of re-using the ihs you could get a direct die frame (this is supposed to be the best.),cpu die->paste/liquid metal->cooler's cold plate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 i was using av1-svt 10 bit.,the evidence appears that gpu acceleration of decode was indeed present as 3d gpu usage went up at same time cpu usage went way down.,"i downloaded latest version of vlc beta 4.0. on vlc 3.18 the cpu usage was much higher & gpu usage much lower suggesting gpu accelerated decoding on vlc 4.0 & not on 3.18. that combined with now near perfect playback without evidence of lost frames or stutters i was getting on vlc 3.18.

av1-svt is a upposed to be the fastest av1 encoder capable of real time encoding speed or better & i can say for most part that is true except where high motion can bog speeds down slightly lower than real-time.",for most part remained around 30 fps which is faster than the original 24 fps.,"encoding was done on latest version nightly build of hand brake which offers av1-svt & av1-svt 10 bit which i used for my transcoding experiments

on further examination i found a graph that displays gpu compute usage & you are correct in that vlc 4.0 does not support gpu compute as there is no activity on that graph but the gpu is still heavily involved in the decoding process with vlc 4.0. not sure what api is being used as such but performance is drastically improved in vlc 4.0 for av1 playback.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thatâ€™s so nice of the liquid cooler to welcome you with brackets that fit your cpu.,kinda reminds me of the three wise men.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"check your cpu for what socket it uses, if you just look it up online you should see it, should be lga 1200 or something along those lines.","as long as the cooler is compatible with the socket, it should work, as long as it fits in your case, which it probably will as long as its not a big tall tower cooler.","make sure you get thermal paste, a lot of coolers come with some and that'll be more than enough for your needs

another thing to consider with intel's server pricing is that they made effectively no profit on server in q3 2022. hopefully sapphire rapids has better cost to manufacture/performance than ice lake, but if not, intel can't improve price/performance for the buyer either.","do keep in mind that many buyers are not paying the public msrps, though, and i don't think it's public knowledge how much intel is charging on average.",i certainly don't know.,"> intel really needed at least a real 7 nanometer process (what is now called intel 4) to drive down energy consumption with sapphire rapids, but the yields are so bad that it is moving to intel 3 (5 nanometer) process for the next-generation â€œgranite rapidsâ€ due in 2024.

this statement is flatout not-even-wrong.",there's no such thing as a real 7 nanometer or 5 nanometer process.,intel 7 is competitive with other foundries' 7 nanometer processes.,"intel 4 is denser than tsmc 5 nm, and intel 3 is not a full node improvement over intel 4, nor is it meant to be.","> by the way, if you look at the entire sapphire rapids sku stack, there is one xcc configuration that has four 16-core chiplets and one monolithic mcc die that has 34 cores on it.",there is no sapphire rapids chip that has all of the cores active.,also wrong.,"the chiplet has 15 cores on it, not 16.  the 60 core model is fully enabled.","> in all cases we are using our own relative performance metrics, which is gauged relative to the nehalem xeon e5540, which was a four-core, eight thread x86 cpu that ran at 2.53 ghz, consumed 80 watts, and cost $744.","we calculate relative performance by multiplying the number of cores times the clock speed times the relative improvement in instructions per clock (ipc), and set this processor at the 1.00 level and reckon all of the other 337 official xeon and xeon sp skus launched between 2009 and 2023.

a couple problems with this - base clock is not a meaningful metric, as all-core boost clocks can (and are) much higher.","they also don't state what metric they use for ipc, although it's implied to be intel first party claims.","granted, it is hard to get a consistent metric for use across over a decade of top tier server hardware, and then actually own all the hardware to benchmark it, but it's still important to acknowledge the limitations.","for reference, reversing their math, we see they give sapphire rapids 208% the ipc of nehalem.","really, the biggest lesson of this article is ""just because you can do math on numbers, doesn't mean you should"".",it's hard to tell whether any of the conclusions of this article would still hold weight with more precise measurements.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

pl 125w cinebench r23 score 24k.,pl 65w 19k.,i donâ€™t know whatâ€™s the score for 12400f tho.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i would suspect the 12600k at 65w would perform better, it is also more expensive... i have a 12400f (from 6700nonk) that i bought for 179 euro - great cpu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12400f consumes by default about 75w in cinebechat 4ghz all-core.,i guess at 65w you will see small to no difference with 12600k in this kind of conditions.,gaming is very different story though.,power consumption is much less and there will be a difference.,i canâ€™t say it will be noticeable though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

huh.,interesting - hadn't considered that.,"i suppose that, in retrospect, i should have specified that the primary usage for this pc will be gaming, and therefore (unless things have changed recently in this respect...?","), single-core usage will be more important.",does that change the calculus somewhat?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i ran into similar issues with my 9900kf and went a different route.,i set the maximum turbo boost limit to 4.5ghz (as opposed to the default 4.7ghz).,this downclock allows my temps to max out at 85c rather than hitting 100c in prime95.,gaming & 3d mark performance yields the same results with the 200mhz loss.,i had to reset cmos multiple times in order to post when i was trying it the way you are.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

right sorry.,setting pls to 181 also does not work.,been there tried it.,"the cpu will continue to 'overvolt', but run within the pl limit, so instead of running 5.1 all core, it will run 4.6-4.8 instead and never boost to its maximum specification.",you want stock speeds at stock pl right?,"you get that by lowering lite load, on my 13600kf, at lite load 1 stock voltage drops from 1.409v to 1.259v and it runs 5.1 all core at 150-160w.","other people have managed to get the stock all core boost on 13600ks and 13900ks to work as low as 1.1v and sit well under the rated tdp, even with pl limits left uncapped the chip never reaches 181w / 253w usage this way, and continues to run at maximum stock turbo boost.","no 13th gen chip appears to need its 'stock voltage' to run stock speeds, they are overspecified with aggressive vids, and running the stock voltages for too long is what leads to lower voltages becoming unstable from degradation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if you can't even find the cpu voltage setting i don't even know how to help you sorry.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just because you don't know anything doesn't make me wrong.,you are partially correct that you shouldn't get any degradation at stock.,the issue is that most motherboards are not running the auto voltages at what stock should be.,"on brand new / never ran at stock voltage chips, multiple ocnet users are able to run 5.1 all core on 13600k and 5.4 all core on 13900k at just 1.1v.",can you do that?,what about even 1.2v?,if not thats because your chip has already degraded with the motherboard's auto voltage.,auto voltage =/= stock.,the only people that cannot lower their voltages as such are the ones that have left their chips at auto voltages and went and ran days / weeks of stress tests and gaming already on auto overvolts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"with offset you change idle and any load voltage, with ac loadline you change voltage after scaling to power draw as a result of ac (in ohm) multiplied by amperage, so ac of 100 (1 mohm, mind the unit) under 140a power draw will bump your voltage by 0.001\*140=0.14v or 140mv, which will add 20w if it'd be a load under 1v originally.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"enhanced turbo is not stock, this isn't difficult.",you need to disable all motherboard trash overvolt settings.,"lite load is the main one, enchaced turbo / mce / 6.0 turbo etc are the other vendor specific ones.","the problem isn't the chip or the pl, its all the trash that mobo vendor twats keep adding to make it go even faster and more volts out of the box.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you donâ€™t have to help me but iâ€™d appreciate it if you wouldnâ€™t be so condescending.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this again?,iâ€™ve already had this with you.,over volting doesnâ€™t do any harm at stock clocks.,stop spreading this misinformation.,voltage can be as high as 1.45 as long as amperage/current is low ( hence gaming can be around 1.3-1.4v since itâ€™s low amperage) itâ€™s not just core voltage you need to look at its amperage/current.,this is what your not getting.,as long as core voltage is below 1.35 during an all core workload it is fine.,i have an asus board with power limits disabled and all core workload core voltage is around 1.28 which is more than safe.,with intel limits i get 1.21. stop spreading misinformation please.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel spec for 13900k is 253w.,"they are proven repeatedly on ocnet to require more and more voltage to stabilise minimum stable volts if pushed much past 253v, or over 1.35v sa in high end stress tests like y cruncher.","several users degraded their chips from simply playing chess using stockfish ai, which turns out to be a huge stress test now for cpus.","this isn't misinformation, people far more knowledge than anyone in this sub have proven it time and time again.","none of those people are running the stock volts, and even msi support have told me they expect users to manually configure lite load based on their chip quality.","the ac_ll / dc_ll settings need to be manually tuned per chip, they are set to 'worst case scenario' out of the box so the boards pump enough voltage to boot with any chip no matter its quality, except this is still far too aggressive on 13th gen for any chip at stock.",the actual cpu voltage you leave on auto.,pl can be left uncapped.,you adjust ll settings until it is working at the correct tdp and voltage.,"the reason these chips will continue to work is they are being overvolted beyond intel spec, which is 253w / 181w for the advertised boost speeds.","to run within intel spec means enforcing 253w / 181w and adjusting lite load until boost p core turbo boost is maintained, in the case of the 13900k and 13900ks, this is meant to be 5.4 all core not 5.5 / 5.6 that a bunch of them run at due to motherboards auto overclocking them.","now when overclocking these chips, you screen for the max clocks at least voltage they will run at 253w, thats what everyone with knowledge on this is doing.","running 300+w on these chips, they will very quickly no longer undervolt to intel spec, and just wait and see they will not last 3 years with daily use.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you have no idea what your talking about.,wattage limit has nothing to do with core voltage.,and its not proven on oc net.,"its people who are pushing their chip too much, i read that forum and i see nothing that currently says what your saying at all.",again i repeat.,5.5 is within current spec with abt which is enabled by default.,boosting technology made by intel.,to run the chip as fast as possible which is 5.5 p core and 4.3 e core.,and confirmed by intel.,and intel also confrimed any k version of cpu is pl1=pl2 so i have no idea where your pulling 181w limit from your ass.,this is the most ridiculous thing ive ever heard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

7600 is a far superior cpu.,iâ€™d also consider the 13600k if the price is reasonable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the real answer is to get the 13600k with ddr4 for 100 dollars more.,it is a better cpu than the 7600/x whether on ddr4 or 5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if you're going below a 6800xt for gpu and you need 144 fps +, i can understand going 1080p.",but you should probably go with an amd videocard and a 13600k: amd performs better at 1080p per $ (driver overhead); 13600k overclocks easily - you need more (usually single threaded) cpu in competitive games at high refresh rates.,intel outperforms amd stock -- especially when you look at 1% lows (more important than avg).,see gn graphs.,it all comes down to $.,but for competitive shooters in your price bracket ddr4 is the way to go.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah, -175mv is really high, but i would also wonder if it would pass prime 95 small ffts with avx without crashing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"would be more interesting to know the voltage while actually running c23, as different mobos also set different base voltage.",currently i have a -0.065v offset which seems to be the max stable one i could run c23 with.,"voltage while running it is at 1.17v - 1.185v, score of about 40k.",capped at 253w.,"p rock stable at 5,5ghz, e at 4,3.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have a i7 13700kf was playing last night with cb r23 went from 230-240 w 100 c all core.,dropped -100mv to 220w  100 only on 2 cores.,then tried -200mv still 220w but all in the high 90's have been running this for a couple of hours.,plan to check seating on my 360mm aio.,i7 12700kf could not get stable undervolt.,may have done something wrong.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes i am aware that ks is typically purchased by overclockers.,it all depends on what youâ€™re going for.,if the ks can meet performance targets that are not all about all out maximum performance while running at lower temps then the ks price difference vs the cost difference of air cooling vs aio may not be that high.,ideally we would have the k vs the ks vf curves so we clearly see the different options with each processor.,this is something iâ€™d like to work on in the coming weeks once i get my ks setup.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good point but if typical usage isnâ€™t going to stress the system that much then maybe thatâ€™s too strict of a criteria in terms of limiting the undervolting unnecessarily.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what would you consider an extreme/impressive undervolt amount?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
those temps with that cooling?,something is wrong.,"a 360 aio is extremely capable of handling a 13700kf, under any load.",usual suspects.,"check mounting, check thermal paste, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what a waste of money.,just get the k at that point.,but hey its your money do with it what you want.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
totally valid point that itâ€™s an unrealistic workload.,"still, i have a real tough time knowing that any workload that doesnâ€™t crash stock, is somehow â€œokayâ€ if it crashes while undervolted.",i fear something random during normal use will trigger that same instability and cause my system to crash just when i donâ€™t want it to.,"and for a primary working system thatâ€™s not just for gaming, that feels like a bad risk.","so i only go prime 95 stable, which does strongly limit how much i can undervolt - although i would really like to try some llc stuff on my asus board next.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ikr even an average k can be overclocked to match the performance of a stock ks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i do the same, i don't care if some loads are ""unrealistic"" i still want my hardware to pass them.",stability is a complicated matter and i've always had bad experience with *real life loads* when i didn't ensure perfect stability for absolutely everything i can throw at it.,"sure i'm limiting myself a little bit but it's worth it, for me, for the peace of mind.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

in newer games absolutely.,"the 4790 is just way too slow nowadays, and gets beaten by an old 10th gen i3.",the fact that it still uses incredibly slow ddr3 1600mhz ram is an issue too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

are you talking from experience?,cause i've spent a year playing on an i7 4770k coupled with a more or less high-end card.,at 1440p.,titles like rdr2 or cp2077 ran just fine on high or ultra settings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i didn't say that the cpu can't ""run"" it, i said that the user is lying about ""probably have a minimum fps bar set a bit lower"".",it will run those games but significantly limit 3060ti's performance in specific scenarios.,especially in 2077.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"now you're talking about ""specefic scenarios""... 
again - i'm talking from experience.",what about you?,"4770k did not just ""start"" those games - they were running on high settings just fine.","so stop spewing your bs about me ""lying"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
color-blind persons may think that the world is what they see before they can see its real colors.,4770k/4790k is a slow and weak cpu for current games.,the slowest 13th gen i3 may double fps in those scenarios.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in what scenarios?,raytracing?,not like that matters for a 3060 (ti or non-ti).,new cpu will improve minimum fps and stuttering.,"but it won't magically double the fps, cause at 1440p you're much more likely to be already gpu-bound in most games.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you may do google/youtube research on the frame preparation process and how fast cpu (single core performance) may drastically improve min/avg/max fps.,"for example, a slow cpu may prepare a frame for 10ms, and gpu with 6ms in total will take 16ms for a single frame which will result in 62 fps.","if 4770k can go with 10ms, 13100f may go with 5-6ms, which will result in 62 to 90 fps abstract difference with the same gpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how can you improve maximum fps while being gpu-bound at high settings and 1440p resolution?,a year or so ago - i've tested several games on 4770k and my newer 12700k system while using the same 2080 gpu.,the results correlated with what i've already said.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"any ram setting other than 3200 ddr4 and 5600 ddr5 for 13th gen voids the warranty, intel support won't even know what gears are.","if it had anything at all to do with the imc freqency, then 3200 ddr4 = 6400 ddr5 for the imc, but intel only officially support 5600.

"any xmp technically voids the warranty, only jedec speeds are ""authorized"" (yes, there is a ddr4 3200 jedec, but it has very bad timings, and is sometimes gear 2).","just use xmp and dont tell anyone you used it, they do not have any means to know you used xmp unless you told them...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

your motherboard will dictate the max allowed frequency.,"your cpu imc can most likely handle it, since with 0.95 sa voltage im able to hit 7000 mhz

&#x200b;

if the motherboard qvl says 6200, then usually even hitting 6200  is hard.",only way to know its to try.,"frankly doesnt matter, get the 6400 kit and if it doesn't work, drop it to 6000 and tune the timings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if the motherboard says it only supports up to a certain speed, that's literally all they're guaranteeing.",you could very well squeeze out an overclock beyond that but they aren't making any promises that it'll work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hello.,i can't try it myself since i don't have the motherboard.,i'm asking before purchasing so i won't make a mistake,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that was on a z690 motherboard that has 6400mhz as supported on their page,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so i need the motherboard to say that is supports higher than 6400mhz to have a good chance of running 6400mhz?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the speed you can run isn't based on the imc?,let's say the imc can handle 8000mhz while the motherboard says 6200+(oc).,wouldn't i be able to easily enable xmp for 7000mhz for example?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it depends on the cpu's imc, no guarantee.","most non ks can do 6400 ddr5, but struggle with 3600 ddr4 due to the locked sa voltage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"most z690 and b660 will not easily support 6400, unless you go for 2dimm motherboards that are expensive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"bro i can't even give you a serious response with that name lmao ðÿ˜†

first one i didn't even look at your name.","now i feel dirty even talking to you haha



edit, real response, the imc may be able to handle higher, but its also board dependent.","it's not a ""one or the other"" situation.",if you get a better mobo you'll probably get your higher ram speeds.,"but even if you get the 6400 ram and still stick with that mobo, it'll still work, providing its on the qvl for that motherboard.","worst case scenario you might have to lower the speed down to 6200, but then you have more room to tighten the timings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so it's possible to use 6400mhz even though the motherboard only says 6200mhz?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what about b760?,will i be fine in this case with the i5 13500?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

always has been.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"haven't checked b760 at all, but probably youll be fine.","check the qvl and see what memories they officially support, z790 usually go above 7200, if b760 is anywhere near that you are good to go.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

running the latest bios.,after reading about inflated sp ratings and the way to fix it is by removing and reseating the cpu with bios reset i decided to do that.,now my sp rating is true.,it's 97 with 101 on the p cores and 80 on the ecores.,was too good to be true !,[gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|disapproval),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"its based on temp, bios has no idea how good is the chip.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>where do you see the different values for p and e cores?,"**in rog asus bios go to:**   
**extreme tweaker** \> scroll down to **ai features** \> **values** should be in there at the top.","i got 99 sp overall:

i think thereâ€™s more to it then that (vid table math): https://youtu.be/olpjn4q3ygi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol same here just 3 points worse 109/73 overall 97 those shitty ecores definitely affect overclocking potential!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did recently get a response from an experienced overclocker about it.,"i asked him: "" with my e-core sp rating at 76, will that impact my build tuning much, or can i get away with it?""","they said this: ""with a low sp e-core rate you may have some ring/llc clock limitation and e-core frequency limitation, but you need to try... sometimes you can find the bad e-cores and limit them.""",so it looks like we just need to experiment with the clock speeds and see how they do.,"i'm following his guide, it's a lot to read but looks to be worth it in the end.",the overclockers post/guide for beginners if you're interested:  https://www.overclock.net/threads/asus-maximus-z790-extreme-and-intel-i9-13900k-a-tuning-guide-for-beginners.1801569/#post-29055947,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah i know him, i'm on that ocn thread",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you try reducing the speed shift max value in the tpl window?,this can be used to reduce the cpu speed when the turbo ratio limits in the fivr window are locked.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
adjust power limits,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to lower temperatures,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that worked thank you!,what about the pl1 long power and pl2 short how should i set those?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>speed shift max value in the tpl window?,how i do that?,"i activate turbo mode on my intel 11700 k and i'm getting 100â°c while 100% usage, i don't know what to do",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can use throttlestop to reduce the cpu speed or the power limits or you can do both.,whatever works best for you is ok with me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"run throttlestop, open the tpl window, go to the miscellaneous section, check the speed shift box and change the speed shift max value to a lower number to slow down your cpu.","if your cpu is reaching 100â°c, what you really need is a better cooler or a properly installed one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its a combination of intense competition between amd/intel for marketshare and the general trend of cpus not improving as fast as they did 10 or 15 years ago which means even low end parts often age pretty well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the single thread performance of a specific range of processors is usually pretty similar throughout the range.,"there's some clock speed differences, but the faster clocked high end parts are basically being pre-overclocked these days and dont usually get linear performance gains through these faster clock speeds.","or put more simply, the main, meaningful difference between lower end parts and higher end parts is core counts.","you also tend to get more l3 cache, which does matter, but the difference isn't game changing most of the time.","so yes, the architecture is the main factor that makes lower end parts still be 'good'.","a 13100 is only four core, but those are four very powerful cores.","that said, unless you're just *very* budget restrained, i'd still recommend going with a six core part at minimum if you want something that will last you a good while.","cpu demands go up over time, and there will be more and more situations where having six or more cores proves very beneficial.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is because a large majority of the demanding things an average hobbyist uses a computer for are just gaming.,"outside of gaming, demanding software is almost all professional stuff where the cost doesn't matter that much.",so there's no point to talk about spec.,just buy what their budget allows.,"inside of gaming, it is almost all about the gpu.","long as your cpu is the most recent, even low ends one will work fine for almost all games.","and they are right, it will play the game just fine.",it will **operate**.,"when you want it to do better than just the minimum, that is where the real discussion goes.",by that time you generally have some ideas now pair well together.,"and if you don't, at least you know which title you are playing and have somewhere to start doing research.",that's why you don't need to worry about it too much.,when you need something you will know it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh very thanks for this explanation, was planning on buying a 14100 and thinking that might keep me content for a very long while since i'm not a multitasking type person; or gaming aaa games for that matter.","i think i'm still fine with buying one, i hope i won't regret it.","overwatch and pubg's fine with me, and a bit of blender 3d stuff.",very budget restrained is my case that's unfortunately right.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh yea, if you're not into aaa gaming or anything, you'll be good.","not that it cant still do aaa gaming alright right now(especially at 60fps), but it'll be more limited over time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe?,i cant really see what it says on the cpu so idk.,i7-something,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"find it very hard to read anything on the cpu in your photo, but the code sr0pl corresponds to the i7-3770k.",and apparently thatâ€™s what you wanted.,"obviously it was repackaged, but the cpu looks appropriate for 3rd gen, and faking a 3rd gen cpu has zero market.","basically, this is the kind of cpu they would be using to fake a 12th or 13th gen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looks like an i7 3770k to me.,that is an 11 year old cpu.,so probably a scam yea,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank god i never sold to anyone this knit picky i always sell my old gpu in my new gpu box itâ€™s a common practice to have adequate packaging and protection while being shipped,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this isnâ€™t â€˜new old stockâ€™ like happens in the car rebuild industry.,you bought a used cpu and the person sent you one in the closest matching container they could find.,i guess they should have just thrown it in an envelope and hoped.,"people donâ€™t hold on to packaging from decade old electronics, someone is selling off their old computer.",youâ€™re either an idiot or trying to play one on the internet.,edit changed wording to correct my rant.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why in the world are you spending so much on decade old hardware?,just get it used off ebay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why are you looking for such old parts?,$500 for a 780ti is ridiculous.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what's fake about it?,i legitly can't understand why people don't just install it and check for themselves.,you will know if it's fake pretty quick.,also you are insane for buying those parts for that much money.,780 ti for $500 is so goofy i can't even tell if this is a troll.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if you are not trying to get specifically new parts you should be able to find a 3770k and other parts for much cheaper.,the cpu is probably a legit one in the picture they just used the box of the cpu they probably upgraded to at the time.,which if you bought it as new would definitely point to it not being that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

they're slightly different.,the uhd has the same 3d pipeline but adds hardware decode for a couple extra video codecs/formats.,otherwise they're essentially the same thing.,op's problem sounds like drivers to me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your t470s has a maximum bandwith of 5gb/s over usb-c and the t490s has one usb-c port that can do 10gb/s.,"the t490s should be able to drive the most things through your dock, in theory.","however which displayport and hdmi standard are being used will also play a part in this, the higher the standard the more bandwith you'll need.","the maximum number of displays that your intel hd or uhd can handle is three, but as intel states on their website this can be limited by manufacturers.",so perhaps you're running into an artificial limit imposed by lenovo here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that's some incredibly fast ddr5!,what speed ram did you have with your 8700k?,i've got a 9900k with 3600mhz ddr4.,i recently was benchmarking pubg by watching replays and noticed a 10-20% performance increase going from 2666mhz to 3600mhz.,i wonder how much of the performance increase in games like spiderman come from the cpu vs ram?,"i've been looking at upgrading to 13th gen, but fast ddr5 really increases the cost.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8700k to 13700k is massive.,just the context of their release timeline tells you how much better it is.,intel went from coasting with 14nm 8700k to 2nd gen 10nm trying to beat amd with 13700k.,leaps and bounds better from a technical perspective,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have a 9700k with a 4090 and i donâ€™t feel like iâ€™m too cpu bottlenecked.,i have a 120hz 4k monitor and most games run 4k 120 fps no problem.,the only game where i experience stuttering is borderlands 3 but iâ€™ve always felt that game was woefully optimized to begin with.,would upgrading my cpu make that much of a difference?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd say before 13 gen it only existed 4790k 8700k 10700k to 10900k.,done.,everything else is unexistant trash.,"8700k is still a pretty capable cpu but it's time to rest, 10gen is still holding firmly.","11gen never existed, whomever designed 11gen commited heresy of the highest order and should get bitten by squirrels and their dog always poop inside the home in places that will leave them confused.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hey there.,want to convict the people to buy a new cpu.,my cpu is way older than op so it may not a good comparison.,"i7 3770 non-k push to max clock at 4300mhz, ram 32gb 2400mhz and 3070ti (yeahhhh my gpu is overkilled my cpu lol).",i recently bought i7 12700k.,brand new build pc.,with 1660ti from my friend.,game test: total war three kingdoms.,total war game is one of the most demands on cpu power to render 10000+ troops on screen (custom battle play large army vs large army).,i7 3770 = you see a slideshow animations when there 10000 troops on screen despite you moving around smoothly.,this is typical cpu bottleneck in total war game.,"note: this is with 3070ti, even gpu beast can't save this.","now, i7 12700f = fuck.... this is the most smoothness battle play i ever see.",everything is 50-60 fps smooth no slideshow animations at all.,"every animations, every kill.",damn smooth.,i even try siege battle with full stack large army vs large army.,"holy cow, damn smooth!",so much smoothness!,note2: this is.... 1660ti!,"not even 3070ti lol  


  
conclusion: if you play the game with cpu demanding like total war game.",don't wait.,buy it.,even if you don't play cpu heavily game.,still worth it man!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thx for this threat.,was exactly what i was looking for.,im gaming in 3440x1440.,"with a 6900xt
the amount of money you need to upgrade is probably still not worth.",the boards and the ram is so expensive.,and ddr5 still slow.,64gb with decent speend 7000+ is crazy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you still need the 8700k???,can i have it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what gpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i can vouch for the days gone improvement.,i went from a 8700k to a 12700k and that eliminated like 98% of the stuttering i was seeing in that game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you game at what resolution?,"for me, just going from 10700k oc to 5.2ghz on all cores, to now 13600k @ 5.6ghz was a pretty decent difference with spiderman.",my 10700k was basically bottlenecking my 3080 at 1440p 165hz gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i had some g.skill tridentz 3600mhz cl16 prior to this build.,ddr5 has come down in price as i only paid $441 aud for the kit.,you can actually buy 7600mhz ram now but that was incredibly expensive at $709 aud.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i saw some good gains the 13700k is like 70% faster single thread.,also came from 9700k.,"playing in 4k 144hz 3090, but i enjoy all types of games and got the 13700k below msrp unlike the 4090 which is still sold well above msrp in germany.",the 9700k is good but i saw it hit 100% on single core often.,every 4-5 years it is noticeable to upgrade the cpu imo.,spider man is the most notable case of the 9700k showing itâ´s age.,the ecores are getting 500 points in cpu-z whereas 9700k gets below 600,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are not a bit but extremely bottlenecked with that pair.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
given you're playing at 4k then i don't think you would notice much difference for the majority of games as you will be gpu bound.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rocking the same setup.,i think the 9700k is still a solid processor.,"honestly, i'd only upgrade when it starts to feel that way.",i'm looking to upgrade next generation me thinks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it replaced a hx850i corsair psu as i wanted a little headroom plus the ability to upgrade the gpu down the line.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
although i am running a 3070 now so i could use a pcie 4-5 mother board,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i didnt know days gone had issue with stuttering, i know it has this weird issue with gamespeed at launch.",i put the game on hold when i was still on 8th gen because i dont have the time for it and just finished the game last month on 13900k and it was a stutter free experience.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this!,"people should stop upgrading every new gen, just because.","i swear, many people don't need to upgrade every year.",use your electronics for longer people!,stop e-waste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
days gone is typical bad port performance wise.,for all console port i usually wait at least one year after the release to play it because eu am fed up being the guinea pig paying full price for a beta.,and the fact that we needed a 13700k to say it is stutter free is terrible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the biggest factor for me was with spiderman.,"no dlss, everything pretty much maxed out at 1440p 165hz.",my 3080 was running between 45 to 65% being max.,"thats when stuttering would happen, to low frame rate, and drops.","unless i disabled hyperthreading, for my 10700k, then i was okay, but then at that point.","my cpu is running around 75% to 85%, and high temps.","however, for games like forza 4, to horizon, to cyberpunk, i would avg just about the same fps as my previous 3070, with my current 3080 + 10700k.","then, with 13600k upgrade, i saw just about a 20% uplift.","only with games like god of war, to red dead 2, which is very gpu bound, i didn't see much difference for 1440p.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
read my other comment.,i already mentioned the games i was good with my 10700k + 3080. spiderman was the biggest issue for me.,"i really didn't want to upgrade, because i was short on cash.",although it only cost me about $340cad extra in order to upgrade to a 13600k barebone system.,"again, games like red dead 2, god of war, or basically any heavy gpu bound games, i had no issues.","any other games that rely on cpu just as much, well, thats where the issue starts for me.","all i can say is play spiderman if you have it, and see for yourself.","otherwise, i had to upgrade for a reason.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
kinda depends on which games you're talking about.,"but, for a game like spiderman, farcry6, horizon, or forza, you're looking at about 15% to 20% difference.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i see.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"far from a smart buy, but such is life.",i would advise undervolting your cpu btw!,i managed to get my max temps under sustained cinebench r23 down by like 5c.,"also, did you get a contact frame by any chance?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had the same feeling regarding the whole socket thing but given i won't be buying anything for another 4+ years then it doesn't really matter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as op said below, i dont care about the socket as i will be using this cpu for the next 4-5 years anyway.","that being said, 7000 series with 3d vcache will probably be better in gaming",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can look at the 13th gen being the pinnacle of what the architecture/socket can do while as 14th gen will be a new architecture and will further be optimized with 15th gen/ future refreshes as theyâ€™ve always been doing.,14th may not even bring substantial improvement over 13th gen and thereâ€™s rumors of them going with less p. cores for the flagship.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same feeling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
going from a 9th gen to the 13th gen this thread is mainly focused on is hardly 'every new gen',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i heard about some issues with running all cores enabled unless you turned off e cores.,you running stock 13600k settings?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that ok i think.,not a big jump.,im.,using a 6900xt and in aaa titles it still runs perfect in 3400x1440 ultra.,despite tarkov,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
such is life indeed!,temps have been that good that i haven't even looked into undervolting.,aida64 yielded a max temp of 84c after running it for an hour with an ambient room temp of 25c.,no i haven't used any contact frame either.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that is correct, i do find that people tend to upgrade more often than necessary though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
?,i have no issues whatsoever with my 13600k.,"if anything, i oc the e-cores ghz a bit to 4.1ghz, and i got better 1%lows, plus my 5.6ghz on all p cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's hit or miss depending on the game.,"some games/the scheduler seem to properly know how to handle the e cores, while others try to treat them as normal full power cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hmmmm for cpus, anything above 15fps is a pretty big jump, especially for 1440p gaming.","for me,  i was mainly facing a bottleneck with my 10700k.","where i would face stutters and dips, due to my 3080 being a bit too powerful for 1440p gaming.",where my 10700k couldn't catch up.,"as long you're not facing any stutters or dips, then you should be okay.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hell yeah.,the 13600k is my next processor upgrade from my 8700k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, you are right.",15 fps is good.,i hope for some more from 8700k to 13700k.,my max fps are good but i dont like the big fluctuation over 20 to 40 fps.,i dont have stutters and triple a title run well in ultra mostly around or over 100fps.,its still super fast but there are games the 6900 is bored.,unoptimized titles like tarkov.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
remember... it wasn't just a cpu fps gain for me.,you also gotta remember that my previous 10700k was holding back my gpu in fps gains.,"if you have some sorta fps counter like with msi burner, check what is the % for your gpu usage.","if you're hovering around lets say 70 to 80% most of the time for all your gaming titles, then for sure your chip is holding back your gpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

iirc the i7 8700k motherboards donâ€™t have the option for rebar in the bios.,i think 9th gen (z390 chipsets) was as far back as they went.,due to this i would not get an arc card as they are designed to use rebar and not having it obliterates the performance of the card.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

just because amd lists 45 watt tdp does not mean that it uses only 45 watts of power.,often intel/amd will list the default tdp so that the laptop designer or end user will know the type of wattage that the cpu alone uses.,thus the end user will know what kind of cooling/heat/battery life to expect out of such a machine.,it also informs the user somewhat what kind of power they should expect.,power well equals power.,more power = more performance.,"edit:

as another user below pointed out, the amd chip keeps going upto 95 watts.",it is just that the scale of the graph is skewed so that it looks like 45 watt to 95 watt is the same.,"but if you look at the multi-score value, it is increasing.",similarly both intel and amd chip in single core mode performs roughly the same at 45 watt or 155 watt.,i think that is the point of the test.,i suspect that the cpu isn't really using 155 watt but they are using 45 to 60 watts in the single core test.,the tester only increased wattage but you can't control how much wattage the cpu gets.,the cpu itself determines that based upon the load.,and currently no single core test can load the cpu more than 100 watts i think.,they all just taper off to 45 to 60 watt or so.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i don't think 8th gen intel cpus support rebar.,but if they do your problems are with the os.,it was installed with csm enabled so it is an mbr install.,"1. you need a windows installer usb
2. boot from usb
3. open command line and use mbr2gpt on your main partition
4. reboot your computer and disable csm in your bios
5. if nothing went wrong your os should boot with no problem.",now you can install your gpu and enable rebar.,please note that rtx 2000 and rx 5000 series does not support rebar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"check all the capacitors on the board, some of them may have started leaking/failed.","might also try replacing the power supply with a modern equivalent, assuming it's an atx board",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

depending on the game 70-80 is normal.,even a gen before it was normal for both amd and intel.,i remember when i got my 5900x at launch people were freaking out that their 5800x-5950x were consistently 80c+ in games and that's not even the power spikes.,what people need to realize is that its more about boosting until a temp is reached rather than efficiency.,right now amd temp will boost until 95c.,and 100c for intel.,yes motherboards do overvolt the cpu for stability reasons but if you want to undervolt you absolutely can unless you have a really bad bin.,right now intel is way more efficient when gaming than amd.,what you have is normal in terms of temps.,your cpu reaches 5.5ghz and is basically the fastest cpu in the world.,so it will run a little hot.,just enjoy it and be happy with this cpu for years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

so this temperature won't affect the processor in the long run or it will not shorten its lifespan right?,and if i undervolt will this affect the stability?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
im guessing you’re looking through device manager?,"open hwinfo to see how its actually performing

check your power management settings in windows and in your bios as well and make sure its on maximum performance settings

as long as its not doing that in game, momentary drops in frequency are normal",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm skeptical of a cpu or ram failing while sitting unused for 20 years if they worked when the machine was last powered-on.,it's a good sign that the board capacitors are not bulged or visibly leaking i'd keep testing them on your troubleshooting list just in case it's a non-visible failure.,"i'd also throw that psu on a tester to see that it's in normal ranges, as they were also subject to capacitor failures and fall into that ""high heat"" use case that tended to exacerbate failures.","have you made any configuration/hardware changes from the way it was set-up when you parked the pc years ago (different gpu, ram, etc..)?",it is probably worth pulling the ram and potentially utilizing an electronics friendly cleaner like deoxit to clean off any corrosion on the slots or contact surfaces of the rdram modules before reseating.,a bad cpu fan header and zero rpm reading could be putting the mainboard into a self protection mode if it thinks the cpu fan failed or isn't connected...the question is what would cause a single fan header to fail on the mainboard that worked last time you used it?,"the good news is, a socket 423 cpu runs about $10 shipped on ebay so it isn't an expensive process of elimination investment to swap the cpu just in case its playing a role as you suspect.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">  for gaming and general usage, there will likely be no noticeable difference.",at that rate you could dip all the way down to the 13600k and say the same.,i9 is a great cpu if time=money and you need to produce more widgets per hour to make more money.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is inaccurate.,"the 6600k is on a z270 at best, the 9900k needs a z370/z390 or similarly locked motherboard",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is the right move.,intel needs the money.,anything they throw to investors is just money being taken off the market cap imo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cpu failure is incredibly unlikely.,plus you're getting error codes indicating a memory problem.,it's likely something with the board or memory.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i absolutely left all other settings untouched, so perhaps setting package power overrides (partially) lite load...?","again, at 6 it provides enough power to keep stock speeds, but about 5 mins of cinebench makes vrm throttle (even with the cheap aftermarket heatsinks :) )... which is far better as default, because that way it did only last 5 secs and it even throttled while gaming... now gaming is unaffected.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i don't think you're going to find any burst capacitors if the device has been powered off.,"without electricity there is nothing to heat them up, so how are they going to burst?",or at least it's probably a lot less likely.,instead they'll go high impedance and the circuit will act like the capacitor isn't there.,you'd probably need to go through with an esr meter and see if they're still low impedance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

whats wrong with msi boards lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
100% wrong mate.,9900k needs a 300 series motherboard to work properly.,"while the pin counts (1151) were the same for 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th, the power pin outs were not the same.",the 8th and 9th gen would draw more power than the socket and vrm could supply.,"so while someone could possibly frankenstein one to work, it’s not within spec and will be considerably unstable as the 9900k clock speed stock took more power than previous z series boards could provide.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no the temperature will not affect the cpu.,you have to remember laptop cpus have been running at 90-100c for years and last over 10 years (assuming you take care of it).,also the cpu will take steps to make sure nothing happens to it automatically.,undervolting does affect stability whether people want to believe it or not.,if you undervolt too much it can cause windows corruption and some other minor issues.,but a nice undervolt wont do any damage depending on your cpu and the undervolt you do.,but it requires hours of testing and benchmarking.,its up to you if you think thats worth it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's a 12th and 13th gen issue.,the ihs is larger on the 12th gen and more prone to warping.,previously on larger dies like that intel used a double lever ilm mount but didn't change the design for the 12th gen from how they had been doing things which results in uneven pressure across the surface of heatsink and causes it to bend slightly.,a contact frame is used in place of the normal motherboard lever mounting mechanism and keeps the mount pressure even across the entire surface of the chip resulting in full contact with you cpu cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you may need to get a contact frame.,there are a number of versions to pick from.,"thermalright, thermal grizzly and others.",you can also try to limit the frame rate to 120 fps.,my 10700k clocked to 5.1 ghz to 5.2 ghz can manage this easily and it floats at 40 to 60c around there.,the gpu is a different story and can go up to 80c.,however i play with dlss on performance mode so the gpu floats at 55c to 70c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
during warzone i have temp spikes of maybe 75c peak.,try remounting your aio.,"ima speak honestly though, you have a z63 which is only a 280mm aio on a 13900k.",while in less demanding games its probably fine its not surprising your getting high temps in cpu heavy games.,if your going to watercool id suggest a 360mm aio minimum for a new gen i9.,hell even on a 360aio i still get in bf2042 temp spikes to 83ish.,if remounting doesnt work try upping your fancurve and monitoring your liquid temp.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i’ll try replacing it as i’ve heard that suggestion often and see if that fixes the issue a little.,maybe even thinking about overclocked the 13900k so it might be time to upgrade to 360mm aio just trying to get by fro now with 240mm.,if it’s an absolute need to cool it in avoid to avoid throttling and performance dips then i’ll most likely upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

one example of the cool tricks the fan control app can do is to ramp up your case fans when your gpu is hot, the idea is to have a comfortable limit on your gpu fans while the case fans work on bringing in cool air to cool the gpu, it works really well for me.","jaytwocents has a video on this if you want some guidelines, you can find a link on the github page.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it helps by removing the possibility of cpu bent caused by the ilm on the 13th gen cpu, so it may not help if your cpu does not have this issue, to begin with.","if your cooler has a convex heatsink cold plate, it tends to work better with a slightly bent cpu, the contact frame may make things worse in this case.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"extremely worth investing into imo

they're cheap, ~10-15$, and tend to drop temps substantially

the 13900k needs all the headroom it can get",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's hard to say.,according to them everything is running within spec.,the ridiculous thing about this is that they had already previously designed a dual lever ilm like that used on lga 2011 that would have completely prevented the warping that occurs on 12th and 13th gen chips.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

undervolting is a way to go.,i suggest you to go with an msi board which use this nice option in bios called cpu load lite the default one is set to mode 9 which is high and causes higher volts so the solution is just realy simple from mode 9 change it to mode 2 and your thermal and power consuption issues are solved by a one click in bios.,it can easily reduce temps by a 15 degrees and lower the tdp around 50-70 watts depends on a sillicon quality of the cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

power on non z series motherboard is often limited to 125 watts after 29 seconds where on z series it may or may not limit to 181 watts for you chip.,some z series motherboard default to no power limits at all.,only temperature limits at 100c.,non z series motherboards often have weaker power supplies that could overheat if pushed too long at high power.,many non z series  motherboard boards have only 6 or 8 phase power supplies for cpu whereas most z series motherboards have 14-20 phase power supplies.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

while cooler can be an issue your voltages are ver suspect.,bios updates are free though granted not without risk.,the is also risks in changing heatsinks so it balances in favor of the free bios update.,if you not comfortable doing that you could have a shop do it that has done many of them.,you can get thermal throttling even with water cooling at 200 watts.,many of these boards have undervolt protection meaning you can't lower voltage below what manufacturer deemed stable.,this is determined by the vid programed into the bios.,new bios updates can include new improved vid profiles allowing lower power & cooler running preventing throttling period of any type.,that is what happened when i updated my bios.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have heard you can undervolt the cpu and get rid of the cep limitations with an old version of  microcode.,"some asus boards, in the newest bios, now have this functionality (by allowing you to use the so called 0x104 microcode, or the microcode that was in the bios back in mid 2022, which basically lowers the cep triggering limit by a lot that you get sufficient undervolting headroom without performance loss from it).",however i am not sure if the board you choose can do that.,"(given that it is a strix, it should be able to if you update the bios.",i have heard strix g has it already.),"&#x200b;

a proper undervolt will not lower your performance.,i am running my 13600k with a slight oc at 1.15v.,"that is the beauty of undervolting, ""potentially"" more performance, but using less power.",it sounds like you are affected by intel's undervolt protection and the undervolting is not applied.,were you monitoring your vcore(not vid) voltage in hwinfo and does it show what you set in the bios?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

disable ecores and go test without them to make sure your pcores are ok its unlikely they won't be ok as intel check them and it might indicate that theres a hardware problem maybe the pins underneath or your motherboard.",if your pcores are ok try enabling the ecores again but start with only 1 enabled and work you way up to 16 enabled if it works then all of a sudden it crashs when you enable say 10 or 12 you know you have a bad ecore which could be possible because ecores arnt binned like the pcores.,if you get it fixed definitely set cpu lite mode to 3 theres no reason your cpu should not be able to run that and it should fix your temps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ok, but that's not the point of my reply.",i was referring to the fact that people are saying they should use faster speeds for intel and what i'm saying is that it doesn't really make much of a difference for intel.,if it was about amd then they might have a better argument (outside of what you are saying about the x3d chips).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
last year i got my son a 12600k processor for his birthday and a new asus tuf gaming b660 m board with wifi (micro atx was needed for his space).,i also put 32 gigs of ddr4 ram in his new build and he had a 2060 msi card i carried over from his old machine.,i also got him a noctua nh-u12a cooler.,he has a 27 inch acer nitro monitor.,he plays stuff like jedi fallen order and doom eternal sometimes and he runs them all at pretty high settings and they run smooth.,"he plays tons of other stuff too, fallout 4, and other things that i forget what but they run great at pretty high settings.",i don't remember what kinds of frame rates off hand but he's happy with it.,basically you'll be looking at a board change with a newer cpu.,non k will often come with a cooler too.,i think any newer 12th gen or 13th gen will be a huge boost.,even like a 12400.  i run a 12500 in my machine with a 3050 graphics card and it is enough for me.,i only play a few things.,"he was using an old 4790 i had, so got him basically everything including a 1 tb samsung 980 nvme drive, and a separate 4 gig rotary drive for his games.",he saw a big jump in game performance due to the old processor he had before.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">if you're asking about using quicksync on cpu vs quicksync on arc

yep!",that's precisely what i'm asking!,>probably about the same quality.,what data have you seen that shows this?,or have you personally determined this in your own setup?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
benchmarks that use high spec'd ram for intel vs the more 'common' speeds say otherwise.,i'm referring to gaming where you generally see insignificant gains (there might be some outliers as always).,happy for you to show me otherwise.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea i thought of that after my last post.,"i know there is a big difference on my machine, but i've also tuned the secondary/tertiary timings which may be the bigger gain.","xmp for me is 3600cl14, but i'm running the kit at 4200cl15.","also, it's possible the 7200 kit they used has very conservative xmp timings which would hurt performance quite a bit.","i can't tonight, but another night i might run both configs in shadow of the tomb raider to see how big the difference really is.",i'm thinking it's low 300's vs ~370 fps.,it's not small.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eposvox has a good video with arc and believe he has cpu in there too.,"media engines are usually carried over and/or iterated upon, not redesigned for each new product.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would consider that a substantial increase.,however i think if you keep it at just your default xmp profiles across different speeds the gain is no where close to what you are reporting.,we cannot expect reviewers to test beyond the 'standard' setups,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intel still has a good lead in non gaming workloads vs the 7950x3d but that only matters if you’re doing more than gaming.,some apps may benefit from clock speeds more than anything and intel still has some lead there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

well ram speed does matter.,i know because i tested myself and 6000 vs 8000 is about 10-15 fps in games difference on 13900k same cpu same board.,"only reason why amd made 3d chip
is to overcome the issues with their mc and to match or outperform 13900k for example.",i do believe that anything over 8000 is a waste in my testing no difference.,i would say they are neck to neck in performance 13900k or ks with 7200+ vs x3d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if you want better power consumption then there's no reason to keep the ks as it's objectively the most power consuming cpu.,"the ks is more of a chip for people who want to build a nice water loop and see 6.0ghz+ on all cores, which unfortunately costs a lot of power right now.",since you mentioned the arctic aio you wouldn't have enough cooling available for the ks to achieve quiet 6.0ghz all core anyways so yeah i'd definitely go the x3d it's less effort for great performance and half the power.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it'd be sufficient for stock settings as long as you limit the power to what your aio can handle because 100% use will push 350w on most motherboards and that's a bit higher than what a 420mm can handle.,"i'm able to run a ks just fine at 5.7ghz all core with 6.1ghz boost on a 360mm aio with normal work loads, but there's no way i'm pushing the chip harder until i get a custom loop completed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"for gaming i wouldn't be tempted by the 7950x3d, 7900x3d *or ks but* the 7800x3d\*.",*how much performance would be left on the table if you limit the powerdraw of the ks to the level of the x3d?,* maybe not that much?,then again... non x3d zen4 was best served by limiting it's powerdraw further.,\*(or a 6/8p + 0e ks i5 ... there was a 0e die with adl 12500/12600 but no 1***2500k***),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes it does.,x3d ram speed don’t matter.,that is only reason why amd can compete with 13900k fast memory,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the current amd motherboards have issues with long boot times due to ram training as well as gimped ddr5 support.,"even though the socket is going to be supported for a while longer, i'm going to bet that everyone who has a current am5 motherboard will want to upgrade their motherboard when amd's new cpus come out which can handle faster ram and faster boot times.",there will probably be other features that newer am5 chips can support that only newer am5 motherboards will support as well.,"the way the 7950x3d works is a bit ghetto as well, having to use the xbox game bar to detect games running and properly disable cores and such.","the 7800x3d will solve this, as that won't be needed, but doesn't solve it for the people who do productivity and need the 7950x3d's extra cores.","imho, i still think intel is the better stable platform right now.","even with the power consumption, which can be tamed with under-volting and/or power limiting without losing much performance.","if someone is really thinking about am5, i'd wait for issues with the platform to be smoothed out and/or the next generation of chips for it.","am4 was also annoying when it first came out, but has since matured into a great platform.",that isn't the case with am5 yet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, i tried to look at all aspects and power consumption seems to be the determining factor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>we know from the internet at large that the 13900 a better performer vs. amd's best desktop offering.,"we know that in order to do this, intel has to consume more power and generate more heat.",can you link me?,"you keep saying the intel is the fastest processor, i'm starting to think you are quite biased or just uninformed.",i've seen cases of the intel beating the amd by maybe a few percent but it was nothing to write home about.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

or am i misinterpreting the results?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i agree, with regards to gaming though, amd is faster in some games and intel in others, from what i've seen it isn't a huge difference.",obviously there are the typical amd outliers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you can do it, do it.",not only you will get basically the same performance but you will get that with almost half the cpu power draw.,intel's power draw is trash this gen i mean 200w draw just for the cpu while gaming is absurd.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yup, good daycare, year round zoo passes, always tripping over his toys, the wife likes to spoil him.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"too much voltage, i wouldn’t go anywhere above 1.4",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
agreed.,it's why i was hoping someone could point out a reason to stick with intel.,stock situation on amd isn't great though.,hmmm.,i might stick with intel out of pure laziness.,"i was a bit worried about my cooler but after looking at an anandtech review, i'm less concerned.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for sure man, you have your priorities right :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looks like you’ve tried everything already tbh.,maybe that aio is just faulty despite pump speed?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm on a really old cpu, one of the reasons i'm upgrading :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is the answer!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just depends on what you consider fine.,"hearing 44db of fan speed a whole meter away from the fan is not something i would call fine because i keep my pc closer to me than 1 meter, i'd have to wear headphones to drown out fan noise at that point.","if you keep your pc in a closet somewhere a few meters away and that closet is also temperature controlled well then you might be just fine pushing 350w

kinda hard to tell the actual noise levels from this review as it doesn't adjust the noise with the load.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"amds 2 ccd chips need you to be careful to use them correctly, intel cpus even with p&e-cores less so.",the real winner will be the 7800x3d which is idiot-proof.,but your chip has vastly higher multithread-performance.,"if you're only gaming, then yes amd has the superior product for the most part.",but yours is far from terrible.,you like won't feel the difference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"agreed, not sure how often i would run 340w too.",after a lot of thinking i might just stick with intel as i already have it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what personally pushed me to intel was dealing with the x570 platform bugs and seeing x670 make the same mistakes.,(google x670 long boot for example.),in my personal experience my intel builds just work and my amd systems feel like a project that i am always trying to fix some random problem.,(ymmv) at the end of the day the 13900k performs so similar to the x3d chips that the only real benefit to that platform is power consumption and maybe some marginally better gaming performance in specific titles.,"you could argue that x670 has better pcie 5.0 nvme support, but ultimately you are unlikely to get a meaningful benefit out of that before the platform is obsolete anyway.",even pcie 4.0 nvme's benefits are fairly limited at this time and they are far better priced per tb.,so for me at least i went intel this time around because for me the added stability i get with intel outweighed the benefits that amd brings to the table.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
www.google.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've seen a few people mention stability issues on amd now on different forums.,"i was adamant about getting pcie 5.0 support because i wanted it to be future proof, after seeing the recent drives and the lack of impact though, it concerns me less.","the z790 hero comes with a pcie card to support it, but only a single drive.",i think that's good enough if it ever gets to a point it will be needed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it would literally take less time to google that than to ask here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the thing that made it a challenge was using four dimms and achieving that speed.,"kinda fringe use-case, most people are smart enough to stick with 2 dimms.","for a dummy like me who went 4x16 instead of 2x32, the tougher memory controller was appreciated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is from 1 reviewer.,others show the gap is single digit.,got to take the best one for amd and run with it though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
on top of that the am5 is superior platform as far as upgradability is concerned.,"even fancy new z790s are obsolete the moment they launched, new gen will be new socket.",this is something intel has to fix.,"i bought a 3700x with a relatively cheap but decent b450 tomahawk max in 2019, this year i upgraded to 5800x3d on the same board.","the value is insane, 5800x3d made me skip 7000/13th gen ddr5 alone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it will start once it reaches 100 degrees celsius.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"luckily i read into the new intel stuff quite a bit (burned in the past buying something without researching it a long time ago) so i managed to avoid the problem, it still made it difficult to choose between an apex and hero though because 2 dimm only boards overclock higher.",i went for the 4 dimm board in the end because i wanted intel quick sync :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this means you've got no pressure between ihs and coldplate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28-30*c?,i thought that would be great?,maybe i wasn't specific enough.,mine idles at 30*c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>new gen will be new socket.,this is something intel has to fix.,totally agree.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah, ye, my bad :v. 28-30c is absolutely perfectly fine with 22c ambient and overclocked cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, for me ultimately it came down to stability.","on paper honestly amd is the better option, but for me personally i had a bad experience with x570 and it just soured me on amd.",then they have the whole 3d cache on 1 ccd and not on the other situation and i just personally don't have a lot of confidence that this configuration will ever just 100% work the way they intend.,another factor for me personally was intel actually has better idle power consumption.,"i spend a lot of time working on a virtual desktop for work, so at least during the day my cpu actually for the most part is at idle.",this meant the gains i got from gaming ultimately would have been lost to the higher idle power consumption.,this of course is a ymmv kind of situation.,"ultimately at the end of the day though amd has a lot of pros that i can't deny, so it is just going to come down to what is more important to you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i did that research last week but with non-f version, ended up with the 13100 on a b660 and cheap ddr4 plateform being the best bang for bucks.","the 12100f is only like $20 less

"yeah, i unfortunately went with a built-to-order, because at the time finding a 4090 at msrp was not a thing.","they only came with 32gb of ram default, and i wanted 64gb.",thought i'd be slick and save a bit of cash by just buying a second kit of the same memory and populating all the slots.,did not realize that using 4 dimms and expecting xmp to just work by default was unrealistic.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i settled with that as well.,couldn't accept going beyond that as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
impossible.,for every laptop there will always be a faster pc.,i use my gaming laptop exclusively and i like it this way but i know most people aren't interested.,apple silicon has incredible performance only in tasks with hardware support and it's not that much better in those where it doesn't have it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i think the 7800x3d is going to become the gaming processor this generation, but for a mixed workload situation like yours where you are doing media editing and some gaming the dual ccd 7950x3d is a really good option.","if you were prone to regular updating/swapping of hardware it wouldn't be such a big deal, but if you are keeping it for 4-5 years the energy costs particularly in the uk right now are a major factor (idle consumption doesn't matter if you use windows power plan to kick the machine into standby)... along with the fact that the amd solution will likely be faster in most games while still giving competitive productivity/rendering performance.","you may also be able to drop-in a socket upgrade in 4-5 years to pick up some added performance on the amd side, with intel this is the end of the line for socket 1700.  

the ""slow boot time with amd"" stuff is nonsense, it's a manufacturer specific phenomenon as illustrated here: [https://youtu.be/dtfua60ozky?t=1107](https://youtu.be/dtfua60ozky?t=1107)  ... where you see 23 second boot times with gigabyte vs 53 seconds with msi boards all running the same ddr5 ram on b650 chipset mainboards.","both intel and amd platforms have issues with more than 2 dimm's, and while the intel memory controllers tend to allow faster overclocks on the ram the impact on actual performance is almost negligible.","i've extensively tested ""intel xmp"" kits in numerous am5 boards, and numerous amd expo kits in intel b/z series boards and had no issue with either as long as i'm running a bios from late 2022 or newer.","my primary desktop is a 13700k in an asus tuf z690 mainboard and i haven't had the issues with heat that others complain about, and it's a decent all around solution for gaming and production work... but the 7800x3d is going to shake things up in the 8-core market and i don't know that intel has a good counterpunch in the pipeline.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i generally do a new build every 3-4 years but the ddr5 thing bothered me a bit because i feel like i missed the next generation already.,a year ago it was too expensive and not as popular but still i feel like i should have futured proofed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
according to my experience i tried to update the bios for my aorus z690m elite ax ddr 4 to get a 13th gen intel cpu … i was disappointed it didn’t work so i’m stuck with my i5 12600kf… next time i’ll get an asus or an msi motherboard but no gigabyte for anymore.,this is my personal opinion.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ah buyers remorse.,i felt the same way when i bought my 9700k it was an 8 core i7 with no hyperthreading and i regretted not getting the 9900k but in the end it made no difference there arent any games my cpu struggles with and will probably continue to be the case in the near future.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i saw how well the 13600k was doing on here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i shouldn't be complaining then because all i do with it is game so really not need to have the latest and greatest cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you can't overclock it.,/thread,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you did not miss anything.,the only places where you can see significant benefit from **good** ddr5 are some work applications that hugely benefit from transfer speeds instead of low latency.,that is a very specific scenario and you would probably know if it applied to you in any significant way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thanks.,i don’t know what ac load line is but will research accordingly :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
like i said if the cpu is bottlenecking your 4080 at that resolution then an upgrade to a 13900k might give you more fps.,but if the 4080 is maxed out then upgrading won’t make a difference.,i had a 4080 with a 12600k and 1440p 240hz monitor.,in some games the 12600k was holding back the 4080. if i had upgraded i would had gotten more fps.,but we are talking maybe 200 fps vs 180 fps so not worth it for me.,in the end i returned the 4080 and bought a 4070ti.,a decease of about 20-30 fps for a saving of $400.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is level1techs explaining his intel test setup, first he explains that the 7950x3d worked fine with the weaker cooler but he needed a better one to hit 6+ghz for the 13900ks.",then he explains that while he tested with 7200mt/s dd5 ram many people on his forum have had trouble getting ram to work much above 6000mt/s as the memory controllers on the 13900ks are not created to an equal level of performance.,"i assume this is why 7200mt/s+ isn't standard for testing for  reviewers as they can't guarantee that their readers/viewers will be able to attain these speeds, the comment from ratiofarming seems to confirm this.","personally i think 6800mt/s seems a nice balance, having a lot of reviews to choose from with different speeds gives us a good idea of how the ram speed effects the relative performance of the two cpus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your ks with a few tweaks and faster memory will be faster then the 7950x3d on average the 7950x3d over 25 games is only 4% faster then a 13900k with 6000 mem the 13900k was faster in more games you take out that one game that scaled huge with cache and it would have been slower on average teckpowerup only had it like .4% faster then the 13900k .,and then you have to worry about this having two ccds crap and amd don't have a good track record with software and thats a risk.,a tweaked 13900ks is the fastest setup you can buy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
make sure the rpm/speed is turned up on your aios pump you might need to download software to do it.,i noticed when i installed mine if i set it to max in the bios it ran at like 800rpm but setting it to max through the manufacturer software ran it at 2500rmp.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the problem is qsync still stinks for quality/compression vs cpu only.,my files are almost twice as big vs. pure cpu compression.,anyone have a better way?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sounds like you’re just looking for parts to upgrade.,nothing wrong with that but you already have a very good cpu.,wait a few years until ddr5 becomes cheaper and the 15900k is released or something like that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hardware encoders are tuned for speed / power efficiency but not file efficiency.,"you could try the encoders on a discrete gpu, but nothing will beat a pure software encode for bitrate/quality ratio.",i picked up a second hand 3900x that i run at 50w for long software encodes… but now that i have the 13900k it might be moot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

your motherboard is more than likely throttling your 13600k harder than the cpu itself.,the pro rs throttled even a 12600k mainly due to the fact it’s a low end cheap b660.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i7 7700 is lga 1151 

lga 1151 can be compatible btw 6th-9th gen in same mobo , but depends manufacter 

if you get new mobo maybe am4 or i3 12100 ( lga 1700) 

the reason why allmost all recomend 12100 is cuz lga 1200 is dead now and intel changes sockets again in 14th gen 

is more reliable get am4 or wait for am5",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the cpu usage hover over 90 percent while the gpu sits somewhere between 50 to 60 percent.,if that’s not bottlenecking then i don’t know what is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"lga1200=10th and 11th gen, 11th gen is *mostly* a side-grade from 10th gen for gaming, if you're going to be changing sockets, you should consider upgrading to 12th/13th gen i3's/i5s, or maybe amd's 5000 series ryzen 5 just for the better performance at a *similar* price (cheaper motherboards and cpu, you can get a ryzen 5 5600+decent-ish b550 for a similar price you'd pay for an i3-12100f+decent-ish b660), at least in the us.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i3 10100 is basically a rebadged i7 7700 which itself is like a node shrink of i7 4790. unless you pair them with a fast ddr4 kit (~3200mhz +z series chipset) there won't be that much of a upgrade in that.,"i have a 4790 running at 4ghz on all cores and it scores 2000+ points in  cinebench r20 vs i3 10100 which scores 2100.


go with the i3 12100. it completely changes the game.",it's faster and sometimes close to a i5 10600k.,"it has a better upgrade path, and b660 supports xmp for ram where as for older platforms you'd need a z series.",you can even go with barebones h610 motherboard and a 12100f and it'll still be faster than older systems.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why do you want so much the 10th gen?,"the 12th/13th gen is much better and will last longer, just for reference the 13100 will perform better than a 10600k in most tasks",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that’s a bit different situation though.,there are games even now that can bring down latest cpu’s to their knees.,"what i meant is that 4790 is perfectly capable of running far cry 6, let alone far cry 3 which was released in the same era, when 4790 was a flagship.","i ran the same cpu for years, so i’m speaking from the personal experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"what i meant is that people claim 4790 is just not enough for the game, which is absolutely false.","as a past 4790 series user myself, i can tell you that i ran far cry 6 just fine, let alone far cry 3 (i played every far cry, all of then ran like butter on 1080p).","i can understand if people will say that 4790 is not enough for games like bf 2042 for example, but when you say that it’s not enough for a game that was released in the same era if not even earlier, then you are really wrong.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

cmon bro.,i was just asking how would a normal user benefit from a 13th gen i3 rather than a 10th gen i3?,and what’s the margin of improvement?,"here in india, the difference in i3-101015f is almost half as that if 13th gen i3.",10th is 70 dollars and 12th is 140 dollars.,that’s double the price.,is there double improvement??,i’ve just seen the videos on youtube.,it’s not 2 times.,there’s just a 30 percent improvement.,for me it’s not worth it.,now how do i delete this post?,?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

auto clock ratio on a motherboard refers to a feature that allows the motherboard's bios (basic input/output system) to automatically adjust the cpu clock ratio to optimize the performance of the processor.,"the clock ratio, also known as the cpu multiplier, is a setting that determines the speed of the processor.",it is used in conjunction with the base clock speed to calculate the overall frequency of the cpu.,the 9900k for instance will boost two cores up to 5ghz for say gaming while all core boost clocks are 4.7ghz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ehhh.. then llc1.,asus being unique.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"llc1 is 1.8 mohm almost double the stock vdroop, he'll almost certainly crash without setting ac ll to something like 1.0

"for your two questions:

1. abt is a floating turbo option that pushes all-core turbo and lets voltage (1.52v) and temperature limits (tjmax) throttle the cpu instead.",it's not that useful imo because it is so inefficient for so little gain.,"2. by definition of how it functions, throttling is expected

2. asus mce at 90c should decrease the abt limit as well and decrease the power usage.","in my opinion, the gains you get from using abt at 90c isn't worth it.",it's severely overvolting the cpu for another 1-2 multiplier.,i'd just run it stock with an undervolt and focus on memory tweaking instead.,the cpu is already pushed close to its limits out of the box.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,there is.,i always disable ring  down bin.,the benefit is the voltage floor is much lower with e cores off therefore much less power consumption/heat with no impact to performance.,if that’s not a benefit i don’t know what is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ok i tried it like this.. the perfomrance hit is too big.. cinebench goes to 22k from 29k but the temps are under control now.,tried putting the ac at .55 and it remained the same.. setting it to .4 decreases score further and limits the power consumption.. i think the max allowed by asus is .62.. i tried with both llc3 and llc4 similar results.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

overclocking is always against the limits of your particular system and your particular silicon.,"now if you use 240mm aio instead of 360mm aio, you are intentionally just setting your oc headroom lower.",your results will then be **of course** lower also.,that does not mean that you cannot oc to a degree with the 240mm solution.,i personally have always oc:d my systems with air coolers and i am well aware that means that the overclocking headroom that i have is lower than it would be with the beefiest water cooling solutions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"“edp” throttling is supposedly current throttling, and is separate from the more common power limits (pl1/pl2).","this typically means the cpu would like to draw more amperage than bios settings are allowing the vrm to supply, or the vrm simply cannot supply the needed current (more likely on lower-end boards).",it is very odd that it’s being triggered at such low usage.,"but if it is truly being triggered, then it would result in reduced performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the 12500h only has 4-p cores so i think the 11800h is probably going to come out on top in most cases thanks to its 8 big cores.,and even in situations that favour the e-cores like cinebench the two cpus score very similarly.,but i'm not sure to be honest.,aside from games can you be more specific on the cpu intensive stuff you are going to do?,"i want to add that, as the other user pointed out, the laptop cooling capabilities can severely impact the performance of the cpu so all the assumptions we are making might turn out to be completely irrelevant.",and in all honesty the 11800h is more likely to suffer from this since it's less efficient.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"sure, i get the endurance aspect.","but to say they weren't thinking about speed... i mean like someone else in this thread said, if you want the zippiest day to day os experience, there's no comparison with an optane drive with its low latency and random read/write speeds vs the traditionally advertised normal read/write speeds only that all other manufacturers keep ""one-upping"" each other with all the nvme ssds from samsung, sabrent, western digital, crucial, sk hynix, [et.al](https://et.al).","it's like, every time a newer/better/faster one of these consumer drives gets released, the only thing anyone talks about or the manufacturers advertise is the regular read & write speeds.",as if that's all anyone cares about when debating to buy the wd black sn850x or the samsung pro 990. the game never ends.,"i mean, competition is good for the market place and i'm a fan of this model lol but i would love to see people advertise more of the stuff you'll really notice i.e.","going from 7000 read to 7500 probably isn't going to be very noticeable for most folks, if any at all.","now, if you were used to an ssd that never surpassed even 1000 mb/s on random read & write speeds to all of a sudden over 5000 mb/s, that would be killer awesome i think!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that's not bad considering my wd sn850x can't even get 800 mb/s and my samsung 980 pro can't crack 600 mb/s... i feel like i'd notice a difference if it was over 1000 mb/s.,but maybe not.,who knows.,"since the optane p1600x (118gb) i have in my hands currently was free for me, i could see it having a use somewhere in some setup, i'll figure it out.",or perhaps drop the cash for 3 more of these and do like the crazy newegg review guy and make 4 of them into a raid 0 config and watch the everyday os navigation and operation be speedy gonzalez big time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
_x000d_hell yeah!,that's what i've come to find out only recently.,"_x000d_  
like i said elsewhere here, i wish manufacturers would focus more on advertising their random read and write and latency speeds.","but no, they just focus on the sequential speeds like you said.",i guess because those numbers are always higher so they just keep chasing the larger number maybe marketing things they'll sell more products that way lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yours is a midrange cooler which isn't ideal for a 13600k but temps are still technically fine even if a bit high.,you can still reduce the power limit or undervolt the cpu if you want it to run a little cooler without any extra cost.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i’m not sure where you get the idea that “a lot of bios implementations are fudged” based on anything but your own single point of experience.,"i’ve been running a 12900k on an asus board since launch and have never seen current throttling indicated, and msi’s boards are very popular and i can’t see reports of that happening either - plus plenty of screenshots showing no such throttling.",it really feels like either a minor bug - even perhaps with xtu - or something specific to your setup that you are quite adamant isn’t happening.,"since you aren’t seeing any negative effects, if you still care i would next see if software other than xtu is indicating the same throttling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

install hwinfo and see how much power the cpu is pulling.,can cap the max power limit in the bios.,can set max processor state to 99% and this should stop the cpu from turbo boosting (big performance hit).,then change it back to 100 when done.,might be able to set a temperature limit in the bios.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"completely unrelated but;

here's the trade off i noticed in games though:
in fps titles, the low 1% and low 0.1%'s were almost completely nullified with the 10940x, but the averages were about 7-10% higher on the 8700k, while the low 1%'s were ok, but the low 0.1%'s absolutely shit the bed.",in simulation games i.e.,"civ 6 and rimworld, ai thinking times were about 8% faster (5 seconds faster per round) with the 10940x than the 8700k.","i'm literally just a random guy that's got single samples cause i'm poor, so my word is a grain of salt.","but the more cores might not be always useful, unless your averages are above where you already want them to be and you're ok with taking a hit to them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have a 13900k on air so i get what you’re doing and support it.,"the llc approach might lower your power usage and temps a hair more, but it’s really meant for overclockers trying to get more performance out of the far right of the curve, and those adjustments are very minor in terms of effect compared to undervolting direct with the vf curve.",(not to mention tricky to test for stability at all loads).,"what it does allow those people to do though is bypass some bug in the chip firmware that affects how the vf curve is interpreted and makes it more complicated than it should be [i can’t describe it accurately but the overclocker.net folks talk about it… ]

p95 is a good indicator of your upper bounds for power consumption and temps but it’s a fairly limited usefulness for stability or real “load” conditions, which for a lot of people is just gaming, but could also be h265 or av1 encoding, or some other workstation stuff.",good luck,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"4 cores and 8 threads is still plenty for a lot of things out there today, but i would never choose it.",in the gaming space 4 core cpus bottleneck a lot of modern gpus now and 6 cores with 12 threads has become to 8 cores and 16 threads has become the new sweet spots depending on game titles.,even things as basic as excel see benefits from having more threads especially when your working on a massive workbook that should really be in a access database at a minium.,on 4 cores i could walk away for 15 mins while it would compile some large change where as on my old rig that had a 9900k it was 1 min max time waiting.,that being said i went amd for the first time with a 7950x build because i ran out of pcie bandwidth in my old rig.,i don't really have any regrets,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that is infact a symptom of thermal throttling.,"with how much it is thermal throttling, it sounds like the aio pump might be broken actually.",should bring it back tell them it is overheating like crazy and you suspect it's a broken pump.,i also reccomend bringing up the contact bracket to prevent bending of the cpu which does mess with thermal contact,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

and hey, it's less than $2000 on amazon.",what a steal!,lol.,"ideally, i'd really love to find a pcie gen 4.0 optane drive that didn't cost an arm and a leg and my first newborn child.",i don't care about capacity if i'm just going to use it as a boot & os mostly drive.,"the pcie gen 3.0 drives are cheaper, obviously, and still remain something to write home about even when comparing to one the ""faster"" m.2 ssds out there at the current moment (again, i rock the samsung 980 pro).",i wouldn't mind a u.2 drive that i could use an adapter cable for if it provided me all the speed i want/need.,"but if i'm limited to pcie 3.0 price-wise, i might as well use an optane drive in an actual pcie gen 3.0 machine i have vs putting a gen 3.0 ssd in a gen 4.0 slot and sort of ""wasting"" the capabilities of my motherboard with two m.2 ssd slots available.",even if that drive was optane.,but i have servers and other little intel machines i'm working/playing with for various things.,and i really need to find out where this p1600x drive ranks compared to all its brothers and sisters.,"and although the internet is amazing, i haven't been able to find many articles or discussions breaking down this p1600x against any of the other optane drives, regardless of form factor (i.e.","u.2, m.2)…

the maximum speed of your ram and cpu are dependent on your motherboard's capabilities.,"you will need to make sure that your motherboard supports the maximum speeds of your cpu and ram, and that the bios settings are configured correctly to enable xmp and utilize the maximum speeds.","some motherboards may have better support for higher clock speeds than others, so it's important to do your research and choose a motherboard that is compatible with your desired components.","in short, the cpu and ram are separate components, and they operate independently of each other.",it all depends on what type of motherboard you're going to buy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

a) find your maximum all core overclock in y cruncher vst and minimum voltage (override voltage mode and middle ground llc level works best for that), disable tvb voltage optimisation

b) swap back to using tvb (all core ratio and tvb offsets set so you'll have same ratio on all core usage scenarios), lowest llc and adaptive voltage, work out core voltage and ac loadline to get same voltage under maximum load

c) raise all core ratio and introduce tvb offset, so you'll maintain same ratio on all core workload, but higher ratio on weaker workloads (so negative ratio for 8 p cores, 0 ratio on the rest), use geekbench 6 to see if you're stable.","monitor in hwinfo your core usage, so you'll know how many p cores are in use

you might check your cache ratio for this.,"edp is package power limit and can affect p-cores, e-cores, uncore, and cache, all separately or concurrently and everything in-between; this would entail that perhaps your cache ratio for example is being throttled due to a current limit specific to the cache itself due to the workload, or perhaps your e-cores are at their limits but your entire rest of your cpu isn't.","there is a specific part of your processor that's maxing its allowed power consumption at the temperature, load, and voltage it is operating at.","you wouldn't necessarily see this as a throttle down per se, moreso that it pushes itself up and up and up until it hits that certain point and stops.",stop using xtu to monitor what your cpu is doing and use a better piece of software like hwinfo64.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not that it matters for your purposes (integrated graphics are *far* too weak to benefit from any more than 4gb of vram, if even that), but it should draw from all system memory.","adding extra ram doesn’t make a system faster - you either have enough ram to have an acceptable experience doing something, or you don’t.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i can 100% tell you avx and avx 2 using same v/f curve and using same offset.,linx is using mixed workload and when it switches between different loads the transient is high hence it is crashing pc which normally stable with constant load.,so it is basically using all kinds of loads available on your cpu which are sse and avx.,on my cpu with avx-512 it is also using avx-512 too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

eh... so you want to use the nas as some kind of encoding offload device?,im still not sure what is the purpose.,"nas doesnt need a high end cpu, in matter of fact, none of the good home nas solutions have anything more than a ulv celeron or i3 (that is already high class).","im running a 5 drive sata ssd nas on a i5-7400 and still have plenty of room to run 2 vms (linux orchestration/backup master and windows dc) and use the main os as a htpc under the tv ... and it takes 50w if it does heavy tasks, on idle it is around 20w and while watching movies it is around 35w as the gpu takes care of h264/265 content ... fitted inside a grandia case and cooling it using arctic 7tc dead silent ... the only thing i did was to undervolt it a tad and disabled turbo ... 

it you managed to get a i7700 so hot that it started to be noisy, then it is more a bad cooling decision made somewhere in the process...

there is no guarantee that xmp will work when you mix kits like you've described.,and yes buying 2 separate kits even from the same brand with the same speed and timings is mixing.,they haven't been verified to work together.,"that's why 4 stick kits exist and are usually more costly

that problem is amplified for corsair because they use a variety of different ics.",one 3200mhz kit could use single rank 8gbit c die and another might use dual rank 4gbit afr (i've actually seen this happen).,"they use whatever low bin ic they can get for cheap at the time of manufacturing

nothing jumps at me there.,"this is one strange bug but i don't really have any fix in mind for now, i'd really need to buy such cpu myself.",but an amd x3d upgrade makes more sense for me due to how much it helps simulations and vr.,i'm guessing your cpu-z results and other benchmarks are looking perfectly fine?,"since modern games tend to use multiple threads while those older titles are single threaded, you could you have worse single thread performance than before but still a boost in newer games.",even the e-cores are not that slow though... they should still run ut2004 at hundreds of fps easily.,this is a super interesting subject to me since i'll never stop playing tons of old games...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hello !,thanks for the answer.,i do have 2tb of storage (1 ssd nvme sn 850 gen 4 ) and an other (1 ssd nvme sn750 gen 3) on windows 11 last update.,"i have tried 3 different kits which is weird :/ i purchased my 5900x day one so maybe i did receive a bad chip, who knows...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hello and thanks for answering !,"i do think i received a bad chip, who knows... (purchased day one)

i only put the xmp profile at 3600mhz and it keep crashing, it was stable at 3200mhz.",i have noticed on corsair's website that the corsair dominator wasn't compatible with the chipset b550/x570 \^\^ that is why !,"looking at the b550-a gaming manual user, there are so few ram kit (2,3) which are compatible at 3600mhz with the motherboard, but i can be wrong, i'm not a specialist \^\^",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'll think about it !,thanks !,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i've been running a 13700k since november with no stability issues (upgraded from a i7 4770k so havent done much amd).,"i upgrade my main system about every seven years and my gpu as needed so i went ahead and went with a 13700k and ddr5 for ""future proofing"".","the parts i went with: 13700k in a msi z790 edge ddr5 board, cooler is an arctic freezer ii 280mm (probably not much different cooling then your aio), two 16gb sticks of gskill 6400 cl32 ddr5 ram, and a 2tb 980 pro ssd.",case is a liam lancool 3 so plenty of airflow.,"i did use a thermalright cpu bracket from the start and used the supplied mx-5 thermal paste using the five dot ""noctua"" method.",my gpu is a 3070 so i can't comment on amd gpu compatibility but i've never heard of anybody having a problem.,overclocked my p-cores to 5.7ghz and my e-cores to 4.4ghz.,i didn't adjust voltages and power limits aren't limited.,"temps:
idles about 28c, gaming avgs about 48-52c, and benchmarking in cinbench r23 temps avg about 89c on the p-cores.","cinbench multi score is 31,921. temps monitored using hwinfo64.",hope that helps some.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah it's super disappointing.,"the review i relied on for the cooler was anandtech which indicated it should be good for 340w...what i don't understand is, why does no one point out the issues with the cpu at stock, are they all on custom water setups?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
likely embedded as that's what ark says the market segment for it is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"since these types of cpus seem to be *relatively* new to the gaming space, i feel like i might be a ""patient zero"" of sorts.","as more and more people upgrade in the future, someone's bound to have the same problem and maybe they'll find a way to fix it.","one can hope, at least...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"neither will i, which is why i just couldn't bring myself to ""accept"" the situation...i had to go back to my old cpu.",hwinfo was the only benchmarking software i used for this.,"i briefly tinkered with process lasso out of curiosity, but nothing seemed out-of-place there either and using its features to adjust cpu priority/affinity had no effect.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the advice.,i'm giving up on the 13700k and sticking with my 9900k for now; i'll probably search some places periodically to see if anyone has similar issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for your help!!,do you know how much does the cpu bracket really affect temps?,good to know that you haven't had issues because that's exactly what i want.,how much does overclocking e-cores increase the performance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oof, i got over 25k on my 13600k only pulling 145w last night.","first are you actually ""water cooled"" or on an aio.",there would be different approaches to each to figure out your heat issues.,"that said, you should seriously look at under-volting.",out of the box these new cpus are set to run up to 95-100c and stay there.,"while that's not an issue with the life of the cpu, it's a pain to have to handle that much heat.",i would get your multipliers set where you want them and start at like 1.20-1.25v and start working your way down to instability.,"alternatively you can hit it with a negative offset, but it's also nice to know your voltage floor imo.","i'm not actively familiar with gigabyte's bios though, so i don't want to give too much more than that not knowing how it reacts.","buildzoid might be a good resource for 13th gen overclocking, i know he uses gigabyte hardware regularly.","edit: also get hwinfo64 to monitor your system, much more accurate and way more information to be had.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
look at individual benchmarks for games if available.,i’d also compare the gpus.,you are better off with a faster gpu than cpu for gaming only workloads.,"if they have the same, i’d favor the 12th gen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, go 12th gen i5 because both 12th gen i5 and 11th gen i7 mobile processors have 4 p cores and 8 threads but 12th gen adds e cores for more (depending on which processor).","the only argument for an older i7 vs newer i5 desktop would be more cores for productivity workloads but gaming won't use that many,  so you're better off with the 12th gen which has more ipc and actually more cores anyway.","no brainer, laptop gpu notwithstanding.","edit: although if primarily for gaming the processor should be down the list of priorities...graphics and system ram, storage also important.",if the i7 laptop has a better gpu get that one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"afaik there are two forms of core parking employed nowadays:-

a. os core parking

you can use park control to deal with this, worked for me.","once you disable it, you don't even have to keep the software installed.","https://bitsum.com/parkcontrol/

b. intel hardware based a.k.a sst (autonomous core parking) 

speedshift is the hardware version of it that is still active and downlclocking inactive cores, this can also be dealt with with park control if you don't want it.","to ensure that you've got no os core parking in effect, you can just open up resource monitor, head to the cpu tab and scroll down the individual cpu graphs, none of which should have the parked description next to their names (cpu 1,2,3, etc).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"on geekbench it's 1226 vs 2136, so not quite double but pretty close (1.74x)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"rocket lake did have some solid ipc gains despite its other issues

and the incremental gains between sandy bridge and skylake were not negligible either

the real ipc stagnation was from skylake to comet lake",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you already re-seated the coldplate/heatsink on the cpu?,it is common for high temps to simply be a matter of a slightly uneven cooler installation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes..?,why would turning off cores help in any sort of way?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
definitely if you're trying to do rendering across lots of cpu cores not having them will be slower.,"with 6 relatively fast p cores most things will still perform quite well though, especially if they don't scale to large numbers of cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yup, os core parking is off.",when i turn off speedshift that causes all sorts of problems as it no longer puts threads on the right cores.,seems to be the equivalent of cppc.,so that's not remotely a option as p/e exists.,"turning off c-states seems to cause the processor and os just ignore parking, at the expense of processor never downclocking and boost not working properly.",i was hoping there was someway to just disable the hardware parking.,"even if i have windows parking off, cores still park in resource monitor, just much less frequently.",the parked wording still pops up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which ones?,there are a lot of 12th gen i5s,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tbh if gaming is your main concern then i’d suggest waiting for a 7800x3d release in april.,they are looking pretty damn good - sick out of the box performance that can be matched only with oced 13900ks paired with oced 8000++ ddr5.,"sick performance, zero tuning, profit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i also installed the thermalright contact frame and saw about an 8c drop in temps.,i think it's well worth getting it.,it's not hard to install at all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
msi gf76 and msi gf63 thin.,these laptops are the ones i'm considering.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think its 12500h,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm just so fed up with the problems i'm having with amd so i'm pretty reluctant to continue with amd although the performance is amazing in x3d models,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
...what the hell is the point in having e cores if it doesn't affect the overall performance in any way?,you might want to word your question better.,"of course there's a difference in overall performance, but how much difference will depend on the specific task.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you has an 2600x, you should be comparing it to intel 9xxx since both are from 2018, you're comparing an zen+, not even zen 2 with intel latest and best processors right now?",i have an 5800x3d which is zen 3 and i don't have a single problem with it whatsoever.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
understandable.,"i haven’t had any major issues with my 3700x and 5900x in the past, but yeah intel just works, always.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ring clock....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just leave it alone.,windows disables core parking by default nowadays anyway.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, and it's not disabled.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
except that you would literally disable almost half the cache that the cpu can use.,it’s super counter intuitive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">  purchased my 5900x day one

have you been keeping up with bios updates?","it seems like each new iteration of ryzen comes out with lots of bugs at launch, which are usually quickly addressed through the bios.",if you still have a day one board i could see this being an issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, actually it's accessible by p cores when disabling e cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you gain performance in gaming by lower cache and ram latency by increasing ring.,it's more noticeable on 12th gen vs 13th.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you repaste it when upgrading the cpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you actually hurt gaming by turning off e cores.,"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lcquumi3rwi

it’s only very specific games that see any sort of uplift",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sounds like the intel management engine is triggering a shutdown (antitheft, etc) if it's exactly at the 30 minute mark.",they can do that if there's been some sort of failed me/bios update or if the feature is enabled.,is this an older company provided system?,"eta: also for clarification, is this a different system completely or did you upgrade the cpu in place?","if the latter, the mismatched/upgraded cpu may have triggered it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nope, it can actually decrease l3 cache latency by 25% and decrease rate latency by 10%.",also windows scheduling isn't perfect so disabling e cores for gaming definitely makes sense.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if you use the pc mostly for games i would just buy a ryzen 5600 and slap it in your current motherboard, it's still a capable cpu and it will be a much cheaper upgrade.","with a 6700xt you'll be gpu limited anyway, so getting a better cpu won't make a big difference in most situations",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"hey slipstream0, it looks like you are having a cooling problem.",first - dont be afraid of 100c.,its normal for laptops.,"if youre running a high tdp load with a desktop i9 cpu, this is inevitable.",if youre hitting 100c in things like gaming and lighter tasks - then we have a problem.,"if thats the case, the first thing you want to do is to repaste the cooler.",taking it apart and putting it back together will solve the problem more often than you might believe.,"double check and make sure youre using the proper mounting equipment - using lga1200 mounts on a lga 1700 system might work, but performance wont be ideal.",make sure to test the cooler under power limited conditions before assuming its not working right.,"most non-sff coolers can handle loads of 200w, so test with a 200w power limit.","if youre still experiencing hot temperatures after checking all of the above, then its time to return the cooler or file a rma for repair.","*i am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.",please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/intel) if you have any questions or concerns.,*,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"your anecdotal experience is already old, obsolete even.",zen1 and zen+ gen were based on very first iteration of zen arch.,so you had more growing pains there.,zen+ was launched all the way back in 2018 too.,zen2 (3000) onwards things got a lot better.,"look, do you think major server vendors would carry amd products now and sell them in large numbers, if there were some problems?",nope.,there was a reason why sales started picking up at zen3.,"stability was there, performance was there and power use was well in check.",brands also don't guarantee stability.,"stability of a custom hand-build rig is combination of several factors:

those are parked.,not disabled.,and they do turn on when needed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you using the laptop's proprietary software for power management or just windows?,have you checked for dust?,are the fans rattling at all?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i know that it's not fair to compare zen+ to new amd's or intel.,"but reasons why i don't want amd is that during the three years i've had this cpu i have been dealing with constant problems, sometimes it crashes for no reason because it just desides not to support memory speeds that have been working fine before, couple times it has crashed because tpm module stops working, and then there's those times when i need to delete some files from windows registry or manually disable parts of windows because they prevent ryzen master from working.",i've just had enough and don't want to continue with amd now.,i know that zen 3 is very stable and mature system (although it has some problems) but on the otherhand zen 4 has problems with memory training and i just want to be fully problem free for coming years.,"i don't have anything against amd, infact i almost went for zen 4 instead of intel and i'm willing to choose amd later but for now i'm going for intel unless 7800x3d is so much better and they have solved their problems by the time i will upgrade my current pc",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my question is specifically about i5 12400 which has no e-cores,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what this person says.,i was silly when i bought my i7 12700 and thought it would have memory oc ability.,"intel locked down vccsa on non k chips, so my 12700 is a pain in the butt with anything above 3200 mhz ddr4.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
man ddr5 does make a difference.,i undervolted and slightly overclocked and i'm getting 29k on ddr4... also under full load im hitting close to 90c but gaming never sees over 70,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you should check the temperatures with something like hwinfo64.,see if it is actually hot or not.,from there you can decide what you want to do about it.,"it would help people in the comments here to guess what the problem is, as well.","if it's cold and the fans are spinning real fast/loud, then there's something wrong in settings somewhere, or in firmware or software.",something causing the fans to ramp up more aggressive than they really need to.,(maybe check the fan curve in the bios if there is one?,did you install any other software that can adjust the fan curves?,maybe make sure the settings there are reasonable?),"if it's hot and the fans are spinning at max and it's staying hot regardless, either there is some program causing _way_ more cpu/gpu load than it should, or there is something physically wrong with the hardware like the cooling solution not conducting heat off the chips properly.","(also: if the internal temps are super hot and the exhaust is cool, that could be a physical problem with the cooler situation inside the laptop.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"btw, if you have an older amd processor, and you updated to newer motherboard firmware, check your motherboard's support page for the supported processors/microarchitectures for the firmware version.",some newer firmwares don't work too well with the older cpus/apus.,1: i would say set a power limit and check performance before/after.,"if performance is fine after, it can only help keep your machine cool and quiet, and unlocked cpus from this gen do run kind of over-powered out of the box.","if you feel adventurous, lots of people see good results with a _mild_ undervolt on these cpus without too much effort.",of course you can tweak voltage/frequency if you're buying a z690 or z790 motherboard.,2/3: no idea.,"4: any one with good vrms if you're going to overclock and run at high wattages, otherwise look at physical features (ports, supported number of drives in which slots, etc.)","and price instead, any 7690 or z790 should do.","differences between z690 and z790 are super niche and are pretty irrelevant to most people, it's like how many usb ports/pcie devices you can use but z690 already has a lot of those.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just think of it as ""more cores,"" because for the most part, that's what it is.","for any one program that can use more cores, like video rendering or compression, it'll probably help.","multi-tasking multiple programs at the same time, _if_ you would have maxed out all cores if you didn't have the extra ""e"" ones, it helps.","e cores are individually worse than the p cores in pretty much every way, but they are easier to manufacture, intel isn't charging you much for them, and overall the processor is faster with them.","for a task that is accidentally running on ""e"" cores when it should be running on ""p"" cores, it can hurt, but this is usually a bug in the program or a windows bug, i think it's not super common for that to happen really.","if you want to know the difference in a specific, real program, try to find benchmarks comparing the 12400 with something with e-cores.",you'll start to see where it helps and where it doesn't make much difference.,"for example, single-threaded benchmark performance is 100% unaffected since that'll be using p cores only.","if you can't use a lot of cores at once, everything will be on p cores and it won't make a difference.",but look at benchmarks of specific programs or specific games if you really wanna know how it works for that program or game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i can get 3600 for like £10 more coz they are both on offer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
happy to see ddr5 can win me something even with my bad/cheap timing choice ;),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes but 13700k has the same amount of e cores than 12900k.,12900k was the best few month ago.,and with 12900k you can edit 8k footage.,13700k is like 10% faster than 12900k.,this is why i am thinking.,right now i recived offer that i is ok with my budget.,1.,"13700k and rtx 4090. litlle cheaper mobo and memory (ddr 4 3200 mhz or ddr 6000 mhz cl 40) 
2.","13900k and rtx 4080. top mobo, fast ram 

i think that for money better option is with 4090. probablly this gpu will be still good in next 5 years and change cpu if needed in 2-3 years.",other hand 13900k will be still very good for few next years.,and i can sell 4080 for good money in 1-2 years and buy 5080 that can be in performance like 4090 now.,(i guess this bcs i see that 4070ti is better and faster 15-20% than 3090ti so maybe in next generation will be the same),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nah its not that.,"i found out that my mobo doesnt support the cpu, thats why it shut downs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yea and i found out that my mobo doesnt support the cpu, thats why it shut downs.",thx for the help tho,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, i didnt match the the cpu with the mobo, thats why it shuts down.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
one advantage with e cores in win 11 is that you can have your rending tasks moved to e-cores only while doing other work on the p cores.,"because of that, i want all of the e-cores i can get and being limited to just 4 really sucks for me.","8 is better but 16 is even better which is why, if i were buying a cpu today, i would just go for the 13900k.",but yeah it just really depends on what you can afford.,"if you buy from bestbuy, you can usually get 12 month 0% interest financing (with a credit check), so that might be an option as well.","if you're doing real work that's making you money, these parts will pay for themselves in the long run and having the best usually becomes worth it since it allows you to do more and faster work.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
will i see any difference in workflow?,or the same sequence will be smoth with both cpu?,"in 95% i start render complete project when i do something different like sleeping, eating ot have fun with my kids.",so like 10% slower render is not big issue if i will be able to work smooth.,i also work in davinci this is why i thought about better gpu that will be ok for next 5 years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is the 11th gen one specifically?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there is a proprietary app that puts the notebook also into an ""office"" mode where cpu is supposed to work slower and i was combining it with balanced power plan from windows.","now no matter what, the fans of the notebook always are on turbo mode whenever i launch a video game or there is some workload on the cpu.","i send the notebook to the manufacturer every 6 months for dust cleaning, i doubt it is because of the dust, but i guess i need to check.","due to hwinfo64, cpu temp is mostly around 60s and even at that the fans suddenly become loud and fade away for no reason at all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hey thanks for the suggestions!,i realized i had not updated my bios so that helped quite a bit.,i also decided to undervolt by 0.1 and now its capping at 85c at max load!,my score also reached 30000 for the first time!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

was able to tighten a cpu block screw which may have lead to uneven cooling.,i found more solutions in my edited post!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that sounds like what i'm experiencing after fixing my problems.,it sounds like you're no longer overclocking your cpu?,i attempted to stop turbo boosting mine to see if it would fix my issues earlier and the temps looked a lot like your original comment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

resolve is much more gpu heavy so cpu probably wont matter as much and going with a gpu will be more valuable for you.,"if you were using premier pro, the cpu would matter more and the cpu would be more valuable to you.",it really depends on your specific work flow.,ideally you would have the best cpu and gpu but sometimes that makes it a bit harder on the budget.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all depends what gpu you are going to upgrade to.,"tbh, in your shoes, i’d stay on am4 and get a 5800x3d plus the best gpu you can afford.",i think you’d be set for a while.,stability issues can be a variety of things other than cpu brand though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don’t get either.,here’s a sample $1000 dgpu-less i7-13700k build that smacks the shit out of both: https://pcpartpicker.com/list/cwvcxy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"was never overclocking, both my 13700k and my buddy's 13900k are stock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this is one of the biggest misconceptions about pc hardware - way too many people think that computers can break if you look at them wrong, when that’s just not remotely the case.","this stuff is *meant* to be run at 100% for days on end, and as long as you’re not applying an unsafe voltage, it’ll do that indefinitely.","also, base clocks really just don’t matter - if you can’t hit the base clock at the base tdp, you have grounds to return your cpu and get a new one, but realistically when under load all cpus will operate at or very close to the boost clock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don’t use high performance power plan.,use balanced.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you clarify what “throw a bunch of tasks at it” and “multiple things running” mean you will get more help.,"the 12700 is certainly faster in single core tasks than your current 8700 and definitely faster than the 11900 in heavy, multi threaded workloads.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

clock speed of a processor is the number of processor cycles per second executed.,"this number will be higher for more expensive processors, typically, or may be made higher by overclocking.","generally any particular program instruction will take several cycles to execute, but because of various microarchitectural tricks, a processor can be working on many instructions at once._x000d_

when you run a particular program, and it takes so many cycles and then divide by the number of instructions executed by the program, you get the “cycles per instruction (cpi)” which is the average number of cycles takes by instructions in a particular program.",cpi is a figure of merit.,it will be higher if you write programs more cleverly to be able to take advantage of more parallel activities in the processor.,it will also be higher if the processor is using clever microarchitectural tricks to execute more instructions at once.,hence you will see i3 of 13th gen outperforming even some of the older gen i5 and even much older i7s.,"just for reference : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5c6nbpirkns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5c6nbpirkns) _x000d_

man.,i did bois update  but no use.,still cpu touch 100,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
small fft is good for some things.,for overall stability you want to run mixed workload because small fft is heavy only in a very specific way (core execution and low level cache).,prime95 is nice because it often captures errors and stops workers before windows crashes completely.,those errors count as crash.,if your computer crashes it is not stable.,by definition.,if it crashes after running 10 hours it is not stable.,by definition.,for it to be stable it needs to be able to run indefinitely.,for testing overclocking i would typically run a hour or two but remember that it not crashing in two hours doesn't necessarily mean it will never crash.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes i bet!,the chip is not running as hot as most people say when you take your time to find a stable undervolt.,"(and have a decent cooling solution of course)

did you overclock your ks already?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't do that.,your gpu and cpu will wage war against each others.,you will get constant random crash and bsod from their built-in anti competition weapon shooting at each others inside your case.,other components may even get damaged from the deflected plasma bolt and ion beam.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks very much for this post and helping me out!,same applies for asus tuf b760m plus wifi d4.,my cpu was able to handle a stress test on -0.189 offset.,"temps went down from peak 100c to 82c, keeping the performance: \~23600 in cb r23 (air only in masterbox q300l).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sounds reasonable for an air cooler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
prine95 is pretty good for temperature testing but not for stability.,most extreme scenario is typically hpl (linpack) but that is not trivial to run.,you'd have to use linux (not actually necessary but way easier) and compile it with intels c compiler and mkl on your own.,after that you need to tune the input parameters.,once you've got that set up for your particular cpu it's basically the hardest stability test possible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i can't undervolt, intel has locked it for non-k cpu, what i can do is limit the power consumption, but costs performance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ok but what i mean is that there are 13700k running colder than mine f, maybe its really missing an aio",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
realbench - a more realistic avx load that i've found is very good at detecting instability (also watch for wheas in hwinfo).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
many have said about this so i just ran the 15 min test and it says result hash match!,"whea errors 0 with my 13700k undervolting but question is, how long this test should be done?",i am not really comfortable running my cpu at 80+c for hours!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
theft would be a good reason they stopped using packaging where the cpu is not visible from the outside so criminals order a new cpu then return it with some a different cpu swapped in.,i know this because when 12th gen first released i ordered a 12900k and received the right packaging/box but inside was a delidded 9700k.,fortunately newegg made it right.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
anything under 90-95c for several hours is really no issue at full load.,80c-90c is easy peasy within spec... so if thats not ur daily temp its no problemo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i’d pay extra for a fancy box lol, might even just buy an empty 10th gen box",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"15 minutes is usually too little in my experience, as i've had instability/wheas occur at around 20 minutes before.",one hour is much better at gauging actual stability imo.,"i also use y-cruncher, which goes well past my 300w power limit on my 13900k in a number of tests - sft in particular is quite sensitive to instability, even when it's being downclocked quite a bit from the limit.",i wouldn't say y-cruncher is a requirement though because it's much more extreme than even an intensive render.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i will do the 30 mins test and let you inform.,thing is i want to achieve 100% stability (in my mind at least) with negative offset 0.130v.,"it passed everything, cinebench 23 loop after loop, gaming, smallest fft, blend, but only was crashing small fft avx,avx 512 test by almost instantly, it didn’t even surpass 85c, hence this question of mine.","later i unchecked avx 512 in small fft, it didn’t crash for 30 mins with the same settings, 0 whea.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i've had similar experiences with p95 small fft avx - some people will disagree, but i don't think it's necessary at all.",99.99% of any real world usage won't come remotely close to it.,quite frankly i think if something passes an hour of realbench and r23 it's probably rock solid for the vast majority of things.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes i know.,the question is how to change the max temp since intels specs are higher than the tolerance the motherboard is allowing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, i will do the 1 hr realbench.","is that possible, that in 13th gen avx 512 is disabled thats why its crashing small fft with avx 512?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

\- the kernel 6.2 of fedora 38 beta has an i915 driver module which supports far less options (modinfo i915) than the one that intel patches into the ubuntu with dkms, so despite that kernel 6.2 is supposed to support arc - the patched ubuntu kernel driver looks so much more fleshed out

\- the onevpl library in the repo intel provides for the ubuntu has a higher version number than the one you can regularly download on the intel webpage: [https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/oneapi/installation-guide-linux/2023-0/install-using-package-managers.html](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/oneapi/installation-guide-linux/2023-0/install-using-package-managers.html)

manual voltage holds max voltage even at idle so more power is wasted.,offset voltage still allows chip to run lower voltage at idle .,manual is ok for overclocking or if you intend to run heavy loads most of the time.,most people should use offset voltage to save power with light loads or long periods of idling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

didn’t change anything in bios except xmp on my ram.,used intel extreme tuning i believe it’s called for a slight overclock and undervolt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah this is like my 3rd pc (upgraded from an i7 7700k) and i've never encountered this behaviour tbh.,any other cpu would only overclock when i was gaming.,i honestly only checked the temps in the bios and later through the asus armory since they go all the way up in seconds.,the last thing i wanted to do with such high temps was doing any benchmark.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh i understand now.,this sounds like a cooling issue to me because this is not normal.,try reseating the cooler and make sure there is enough mounting pressure.,check whether your pump is working (does your radiator get warm?).,also look if there is some plastic film on the cooling block that you need to remove.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks i will do that even though i honestly still wonder how the cpu overclocking permanently could have something to do with an incorrectly mounted cooler.,last time i checked i could feel slight vibrations in the pump and tubes but no heat on the radiator.,since i applied the thermal paste just yesterday do i really need to reapply it or would it be alright if i let it be?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i am using a kraken x53 on my 12700,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you very much for your input i am pretty sure it's a cooling problem now because even at stock the temps are between 40 to 60 degrees which seems too high.,"my mainboard tells me for the maximum clock of 5,1 ghz it would use 1,33v which also seems a bit much so i'll look into that if remounting doesn't help.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
save up for the 13600k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

so i reseated the cooler and also reapplied the thermal paste just to be sure (i also checked if it got spread well) and the issue still persists.,i have to admit that i placed the pump upside down from what is shown in the manual because the tubes were too stiff but that wasn't a problem with my last pc or one of my friends.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"could be slow memory, like running only in single channel mode.",than the igpu is just waiting for data.,also in the past it was possible to overclock igpu with intel xtu but i don't have intel laptop now to verify.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
an upside down pump is not ideal but shouldn’t cause massive cooling issues as long as there arent any air bubbles in the loop.,i assume that there’s good airflow in your case?,if the water and radiator stays cold no matter what then there’s likely something wrong with the aio.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

great multi core score and your single core sounds about right.,my last single core test was 2148. if you use the intel extreme tuning utility you can overclock your settings dependent on how many cores are being used.,(for reference my multi core score was about 37500),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
try limiting your power limits to the intel's recommended 253w turbo and 125w base.,if you are still overheating try limiting the turbo down lower as well until you are able to keep the pc running.,then i'd recommend getting your bios updated and drivers installed to see if that makes any difference.,it sounds like either your cooler isn't making good contact with the cpu or something with the pump/fans isn't operating right.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no bsod or black screens.,cb throws an error.,the intel stress test also just says the stress test failed.,games either just close or displays some error.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a 360mm aio will be able to keep a 13900k from thermal throttling when pl1=pl2=253w, so using a noctua is possible but not the ideal scenario.","a stock 13900k will usually score roughly 39,000 in cinebench r23, so clearly there's a slight performance loss when lowering the power limit - roughly a 5% loss, but definitely not that big of a deal.",i agree with your message though - air cooling can work for the 13900k if your main focus is gaming and/or willing to lower power limits.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if your cpu temps aren't going crazy i can think of a few other immediate possibilities.,even if you were hitting 100c the cpu should start throttling itself rather than just crashing.,the first thing that comes to mind is your power supply.,you may not have enough power for all your components or you might be getting power spikes that your power supply can't handle properly.,"if you have spare cables try swapping some of the cables you are using out for the spares, its possible you have a faulty cable or may even have one that is loose and not getting a proper connection.",the second thing that comes to mind is faulty memory.,make sure you have xmp enabled for your memory in the bios and run a memtest to see if you are getting any failures.,also not sure what video card you are running but it could be at fault for games crashing if you are running them at settings it can't handle.,"(or it could be failing/faulty as well)

one by one test the things you can disable or swap out to see if it fixes it, as it can be pretty hard to know if your motherboard is at fault or not.",if nothing you try works then it might be time to rma the board and hope that was the problem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hmm didn't think about turning down the turbo, i really believe the pump isn't making good contact.",also think bad thermal paste as it was all runny when i put some on the 3rd time.,i appreciate everyone's help!!,once resolved i will update with the resolution,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you may want to look at getting a 13th generation contact frame to replace the default intel cpu frame.,i know with my noctua nh-d15 it gave me better contact and lowered my temps about 8-10c on average.,(not sure if this would solve your issue at hand however),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what error from cb?,need more specifics.,what error from games?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i get a round 2260 in cinebench.,"use hwinfo and see what your cores are doing

to you, and to others, how necessary is the contact frame in reality?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you getting 2260 with the i9 stock?,i've used hwinfo and pcores were at 5.5 while ecores a 4.3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did try to do some undervolting but i got unlucky with my cpu and wasn't able to maintain stability.,for me the contact frame dropped my temps about 10c which is pretty huge for just $12 so its definitely worth it to me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for sharing your results & info.,good to know for future reference as i personally prefer air cooling when possible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

a 240mm aio is *not* a good match for a 13900k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
people just like to shit on intel their cpus aren’t that hard to cool.,have mine ocd stable at 6ghz p cores and 4.6 ecores hitting over 44k in r23 never exceeding 85c.,honestly it’s a good cpu all around.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
everything on auto except xmp which i set on.,make sure you get rid of any background tasks or apps.,including icue or anything like that.,because those apps can stop boosting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i know this is a bad example but when i bought my 12600k we tested with my friend's d15 and the silentumpc fortis 5 that i bought for it.,a whopping 3 degree celsius difference in cinebench.,exciting stuff.,the noctua being literally 3 times the price of my budget cooler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you need at least a 360mm for i7-i9.,"with a 360mm, pl of 253 and -0.100 offset, you should be idling at 32c / 65-70c @ 100% load running stock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"seems a memory issue and not cpu, check without xmp",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"try setting the limit to 253w and see what happens, it also depends on your cooler.","my 13900k scores around 40500 with a 253w limit, you should score higher if you have a 360 aio installed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i forgot to close icue🥲, i’ve benched it again in single and it scored 2118… still less then average i think!",can my z690 unify be the problem?,(latest bios and intel me installed),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"39000 in r23 is probably about the most commonly reported score, they usually tend to range from 38000-40500, its just about the silicon lottery most of the time.","and yes every single cpu regardless of what it is will render some blocks slower as they are tougher to render, this is how the test is designed, its not a stutter or anything, its just harder to render.","and your right, most people are seeing higher temps while running that test but still scoring roughly the same, the performance should be equal to others provided they don't thermal throttle.",the discrepancy in score is silicon lottery and theres not much you can do to increase the score significantly unless you start using ln2 and oc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got my d15 for the 12900k and it pretty much matches what i see most people using aio get.,good to know it'll handle the 13900k if i upgrade 👍,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the ks doesnt really perform a whole lot better than the standard k despite its higher clocks, you could probably reduce the clocks to the normal k model clocks and acheive the same results or very similiar.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you have a defective cooler.,i rma'ed a x72 last year because it also overheated with a 12900k while idling on windows.,"not entirely sure what happened there as it would otherwise work fine on a 9900k, but it simply didn't work on the 12th gen i9.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
.8-1 volt i’m pretty sure i think i’ve come to the conclusion it was a faulty pump tho one fan on the pump stopped working and was getting a pump failure signal so i decided to take the pump out and i ordered a new one will update in a day or two when i get the new pump if anything changes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
download hwinfo and see what your clockspeeds are.,only cinebench and hwinfo should be running.,see if your actually hitting 5.8 which i dont think you are.,2150 is around teh score of hitting 5.5.,5.8 is around 2240ish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i’ve got the d15/13900k/torrent combo.,it’s been great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes i was looking at hwinfo during the test and all p cores were at 5.5, in all the tests i’ve done i have never seen 5.8",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i'm loving the case.,the stock fans are pretty quiet with my curve when i'm just doing everyday stuff too which is nice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean yeah if you want aio i'm sure there are lots of great options that could cool this baby better.,i just know a lot of people already have the nh-d15 and want to know if they can swap it to this or people like myself that just want to stick with good old air cooling.,"i love how many options we have now, there's so many ways to achieve what you want so you can have your own style.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"runned another test with pcores at 5.8 and e cores at 4.6, it scored 2240 but i have setted the clock manually in the intel tuning utility",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my 13900ks does 43k with a 5.7/4.6 all core oc, but pulls 320w to do it.",are you using just the defaults?,or have you tweaked anything on your own?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"actually at auto it defaults to 181w so you have thermal budget to go higher pl1, therefore hit higher clock speeds.",but higher pl1 is not always a good thing since too high and cpu throttles and for some reason that makes it run slower than lower power but not throttled.,"btw, do you have any issues with front usb 2 ports after upgrading the bios?",from time to time it justs stop working for me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's the icue service and the fact it uses usb.,with usb devices the cpu constantly polls them for new inputs.,this takes away the cpu power to do other things.,"generally this impact is small but if the device is passing control logic such as rpm control for fans then the cpu cycle consumption maybe higher overall

glad you got it sorted, the next test would have been to disconnect the usb connection from the pump and use autoruns to disable all icue related things.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you tried undervolting it?,"you can also try to reseat the cpu block (make sure to read the instructions, unlike what i did)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i would say the fractal torrent helps it :) i have a 32 core threadripper in a fractal torrent with a noctua cooler and i swear that case is the best for air cooling.,those two huge front fans are amazing.,i briefly had my 13900k in the fractal torrent case but put it in a corsair 7000d with an h170 elite lcd aio.,it's good to know the d15 cools it although i run my 13900k at 13900ks specs with unlimited pl1/pl2.,"even with an ai it can get to 100c in cinebench but if i use cpu lite mode 7, it's completely stable and peaks at 95c.",i can't imagine a d15 doing that but i'd love to know if it could.,i also prefer air coolers.,"before having a noctua on my threadripper, i had an aio that leaked...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i will try various values soon but i believe there is a sweetspot between 181w and 220w which hits 90ish degrees without throttling that should give the highest score.,if 160w does not change the cinebench score then i would try to minimize pl1 to get the maximum power efficiency i guess.,in the end it comes down to efficiency vs speed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have the asrock z690 extreme with a 13600k.,mine stays in adaptive mode but i stopped seeing a thermal benefit at about -70mv core and began to lose benchmark performance.,the cpu was having trouble sustaining clock speed beyond that.,i was able to drop the ring voltage by -50mv and saw additional benefit but lost stability and/or performance below that.,went from ~215w under full load to ~165w with the associated thermal benefits.,i haven't seen too much about undervolting with asrock so thought i would add my experience.,i'm also new to undervolting so hopefully someone else with more knowledge or experience can chime in.,edit.,to try and answer your questions.,83c sustained at that wattage seems pretty good to me.,undervolting is generally quite safe.,the main issues you might encounter are system crashes or instability at which point you would need to add a bit more voltage back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

dont look at effective clocks while gaming.,gaming is usually a low load where clocks will downclock after the boost period for that core is done.,so it will show it as a lot lower in effective clocks.,only look at that during a cinebench run or something like that.,"and i dont know what you mean by ""throttling"".",do you mean that temps are high so it downclocks?,or are you saying you undervolted so much you the clocks cant be sustained in load.,you literally give no information.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what kind of fps are you normally targeting 144fps?,"165, 240?",if it's just like 144 or even lower your will most likely be gpu bound in most games to some degree.,some games may be an outlier here and there but if you already have a 11400 pairing it with a 3060ti or 3070 is a decent pairing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

but it was well worth it considering the deal!!",i didn't know they still had these combos on sale.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how is this unfortunately?!,you are getting an amazing deal on this combo.,you can never find this type of deal anywhere else!!,the 12900k was 100 more.,i chose the 12700k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, unfortunately, being because, obviously, 13th gen is better than the 12th gen while being a little bit more pricey.",that's the unfortunately part.,and yes this is still a really good deal that'd be stupid to pass up.,i grabbed my 12700k and asus tuf d5 when they were doing this deal but you only paid 50 dollars extra of the discounted cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dude that’s what i was thinking man but the stress  test result said one of the p core wasn’t functioning prolly need to tweak something on the bios again is a asus hero z790 maximum motherboard but hopefully is not the motherboard that is causing that issue but exchange to another one is getting ship here like in a few days hopefully i can resolve the issue thanks for looking out!,so the number count core start from o to 7 for p core ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what is your ambient temperature?,it affects a lot.,on colder days my 13900k tops up at 85c running r23 10 minutes at 253w power limit full load 1.164v.,when it’s hotter like 25c my full load temp is around 92c.,it’s a huge difference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

between 25-29c.,but my cpu also idling around 35c.,is it a huge problem for this situation ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

how can any drive exceed gen 4 speeds in a gen 4 slot?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">30c

yes, it's your ambient temps being so high.",that is about 10-17f higher than my room temp.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think so too, although the 13500/13600(nonk) has a slight edge mainly in productivity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh well.,yeah your room is at optimal temps.,"but my idle temp is 35c, i think it's adequate cool for this ambient.","however, 320w is too high, i instantly hit 99c in 2-3 secs if i try to pull 300w+ i think that's not related with ambient temp.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
here is a quick fix to get your temps down around at least 10c.,"go to the bios, go to tweakers paradise and scroll down till you see microcode version.",select the opposite from default.,this should shave off some power and temps instantly.,:),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes the aio is installed correctly.,i know that i can undervolt from the bios but i am not getting stable results.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"you do not reduce performance by adjusting llc at all, clock stretch happens when you're undervolting too much or have uv protection enabled.","or you're on b660/b760 motherboard with a newer bios, that has uv protection enabled and inaccessible (or uses wrong config bit, like msi boards do).","when you're about undervolting, upping llc is what you want to do first, to bring low load and high load voltages closer, this reduces the vdroop, which makes you able to lower low load voltage from the get go and also reduces the gap between maximum voltage offset of both scenarious and you're not getting limited by either of these as much, this way you can push higher voltage offset, you will end up with same power draw on high load as on weak llc and lower power draw on low load.","untouched, stock ratio can operate completely stable at much lower voltage, than it runs on by default, by leaving high llc you will limit yourself to basically high load voltage limit, leaving a lot of voltage headroom for lower load.","and leaving ac loadline to default, absurd values is just idiotic, you're limiting yourself to low load voltage tolerance this way, as vrm boosts tons of voltage to counter the set vdroop, corresponding to active llc.","nowadays you want the maximum vdroop, due to turbo boost development, as you can assign individual ratios to specific cores or per n cores usage and the higher the frequency, the higher the voltage required, but you still want the least voltage possible for high core count workloads.","that way you can have say 1.435v for single/two core usage with 5.5ghz and still drop to 1.26v for all core usage with 5.1ghz (i have 5.3/5.3/5.2/5.2/5.2/5.1/5.0/5.0 for 1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8 cores being used, 1.435-1.302v).",and this can be perfectly stable.,you do not want to use medium llc for an *actual daily* overclock as this ends up either limiting your low core overclock or severely overvolt all core.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i never understood why people worry about temps for benchmarking.,like why not just enjoy your computer for gaming and you don’t have to even worry about thermal throttling.,"if you want to keep performance high, leave the turbo wattages on unlimited, but make sure you enable thermal velocity boost in the bios and setup what you want your cores to run at depending on how many cores are active, set your performance cores with a light overclock or just leave them stock, then set temperature offsets for whatever temperature you want the turbo ratio to reduce in order to reduce temps.","i personally don’t mind reaching 95-98 during an intense benchmark, because these chips are meant to handle that temp without damage.",just remember you won’t always be running benchmarks so you won’t always be at those high temps.,i typically don’t tell the tvb to reduce the turbo ratios until it hits a minimum of 95 and the.,just -1 offset and if it goes beyond that i have it reduce at 98c -2 offset for all active core scenarios.,"so i do 1 active p core 60x, 2 active p cores 60x, 3 active p cores 58x, 4 active p cores 58x, 5 active p cores 58x, 6 active p cores 58x, 7 active p cores 57x, & 8 active p cores at 57x.","however, this overclock is centered around gaming stability since i wont ever reach super high temps while gaming for hours.",however this might need to be reduced to 57x or even 56x for 6 performance cores and 60x for the 2 remaining star p cores.,it just depends on ur cooling capabilities.,if you only have a 360mm aio i would keep everything at stock 6-p cores at 56x and 2 remaining star p cores at 60x and still enable thermal velocity boost to negative offsets for whatever temperature range you want to keep you cpu at during benchmarks.,some may do 70c on the first step and a -1 offset and 90c for the second step and either -1 or -2 offset.,like i said i like to use all the thermal headroom to eek out all the performance i can.,i wouldn’t worry about hitting 95-99c during a benchmark like r23.,you won’t ever get near those temps during normal use and gaming.,"sorry for the long post, i understand not every one would oc this way and ideally you would want to adjust your voltage to something more optimal.",i just leave all my voltage stuff on default auto and just use thermal velocity boost to keep temps in check during heavy loads/benchmarking.,while keeping performance and frequency high during gaming when the cpu usually never goes over 45% usage and typically never goes above 70-80c max.,my liquid cooler is the corsair h170i elite lcd 420mm aio.,i also use a thermal grizzly contact plate over the cpu and lastly i use kryonaut extreme thermal paste.,"i don’t really have the patience for dealing with a custom water loop, if i need to change a component out i don’t want to have to drain my loop or disconnect part of it.",thanks!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

with low llc you have 1.3v and drop all the way to 1.18v under heavy load, you do not overclock, meaning you low load required voltage is pretty much guaranteed to be kinda close to what's required for all core.","this means, trying to undervolt on high vdroop you get limited by all core workload, you will hit a point of high load instability waaay before you hit a roadblock on low load.","there also is an issue with ac loadline, that boosts voltage in accordance to current being drawn (ac of 30/0.3 will add additional 30mv/0.03v per each 100a being drawn, by default all boards have ac of 1.1/110 or 1.7/170), which on low llc is set to a fked level, but most of the time you still cannot drop ac ll to a level, where on low/medium load you still be wouldn't be punching way too much voltage.",ac ll ideally should be left at 1/0.01 and only be used for overclocking when fully utilizing n core turbo ratio.,"with medium llc you still have 1.3v, but this time you drop to 1.25v (kinda exaggerating, but it's an example), so you can bring both ends of workload scenario down with higher offset.","this is by general the most efficient way to undervolt without changing cpu ratios, so far the only actual exception is 13900ks with its 6ghz 1/2 core boost, where it won't actually work the best.","you still have multiple llc levels between close-to-no llc and medium level, so there's quite a lot of adaptability, but in general using high vdroop llc for isn't ideal for pure undervolt.",i hope it's readable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is likely your issue..    very under spec power supply for a 3080.    the rtx 30 series are very power hungry and if your psu can't deliever around 380-400w clean power to your video card.,very likely you'll end up with instability or crashes.,or in some cases your pc might just shut off.,not to mention that psu only has 2 pcie connectors coming off the psu.,it's not a good idea to daisy chain connectors for these high power cards.,i have a 4080 now but when i got my 3080 at release i had all kinds of issues with games crashing and just generally wasn't stable.,replaced my 10yr old power supply with a new 1000w seasonic psu and was rock solid from that moment on.,now i went a bit overkill probably would have been fine with 850w.,but i wanted some headroom for upgrades later down the line.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

do you experience cpu bottlenecking with your current usage?,what is your cpu load %?,that said if your cpu is underutilized based on your current usage and you don't see yourself needing more cpu power there is no need for an upgrade.,"however, if you do find yourself in a cpu bottleneck situation and you need the extra power, why not go with the best of this gen, like 13900k or ks?",rather than waiting for aarow lake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not every pin in the socket is actually utilized.,hard to say if your bent pin is causing an issue.,you can try to bend it back with tweezers or maybe a very small fine pin if the tweezers aren't small enough.,if you can still could try to return the motherboard.,if the new motherboard doesn't fix this issue.,then i'd look at your power supply then.,the issue your having pretty much exactly lines up with psu issue as you mentioned only games are crashing.,if it was a cpu/motherboard issue then you'd get crashes in everything not just games.,have you tried to run any stress tests like cinebench r23?,if your cpu can do a 30 min stress test on that without a crash it's very unlikely the bent pin is causing a problem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"while prime 95 may not be the best stability test by itself, it only takes 1 action to make it amoung the very best.",what is that action?,merely moving the mouse on a regular or continuous basis.,why is this?,because moving the mouse interrupts the test in a manner that produces very large spikes & dips in power.,do not do anything other than moving mouse as that does not produce the interruptions that merely moving the mouse does.,these spikes & dips are larger than can be produced by any other stress program.,these are complete stops & starts when mouse is moved even though it may not appear that way as they are so brief.,they can only be seen on an oscilloscope.,"if you can move the mouse while running prime 95 while under load & not crash or have workers stop, you are very stable.",i have done that on my system with no problems.,"this will also let you know if you have your loadline set correctly, as if not, it will require more voltage under load to be stable.","[see this video](https://youtu.be/zqvnkh4tvw8)

"i'm not on ddr5 yet, but i guess you can get some faster kits, prices are getting better.","idk about how much you care about this build being cost efficient or if you work/edit on it but 8tb of sata ssds are perfectly fine, unless you have a specific use for those 8tb nvme ssds",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"at least in europe intel is the one to buy im.sorry for the x3d, performance may be a bit better in some games with the 7800x3d but it will be almost same price as 13900k.... with a 13600k in arround the same performance.... also b650mb are way more expensive than b660/b760, 300€+ vs 150 + ddr4 support",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they're about the same price from my research mate.,i can get a 4tb pcie3 nvme for £220.,everywhere i look its around the same price for ssd give or take £20-£50.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ok, i didn't know that!","anyway, what appears to be your main ssd (corsair mp600 pro 2tb) has a heatsink, but the motherboard you selected has a nvme ssd shield or whatever it's called.",so it won't fit unless you remove the heatsink or leave the shield unmounted.,not entirely sure but i guess,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in fact i had just changed the thermal paste minutes before that test!,"however i did some changes in the cpu's fan speed, and right now i am running a test with an average 82 degrees celsius, and the system seems stable after an eight hour test, 82 is an acceptable temp?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
82 under load is not that close to max temp and is perfectly fine.,sounds like you got it all squared away!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for gaming the 7800x3d will have no competition.,"x3d chips already have no competition for gaming, the 13900k is not a realistic choice unless you want to be a cheerleader.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're embarrassing yourself.,every gaming test shows clear ram scaling on intel cpu's and the only results showing any meaningful separation from regular amd chips use very fast ram.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i would imagine they had just enough money to build a new pc, excluding the gpu.",the gpu likely came from an old build and is a placeholder until a better one can be purchased.,"the point still stands, though, that the 1050 would be better used to record the screen than the igpu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i aim to build it slowly.,the aim for building this pc was 3d rendering.,usually a cpu lasts longer and is much more durable and also more stable during rendering even though it's slower than a good gpu.,plus gpus are damn overpriced to buy first.,plus i usually only play less intensive games like valo and stuff.,maybe in a year or so i'd collect enough for a 4080 or so but maybe something new comes out by then so yea stuck with these two for the time being.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you're right it's a placeholder.,"on the second point, why would nvenc be better tho?","my idea was that since the dgpu is used when gaming, the igpu could be used for the capture part.",also my fps drops from 140 to 130 when using the dgpu for capture which isn't really much but i could eliminate that with the igpu since it's literally never used.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yes, it will, absolutely.",also a fun fact - i've ran on uhd 770 on 12700k for a year or so.,"everything overclocked to limit (so cpu, ram and igpu) against stock with 3200 cl14 dual rank xmp was legit 100% and above improvement in fps.","also, just using 8gb ram instead of 4 will give you lots of improvements.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes regarding cost efficiency intel is slightly better choice but you also have to consider a better cooling solution because of the power draw otherwise you have to deal with a lot more noise.,"also, 7800x3d will only be comparable in performance because once again the gpu will bottleneck and it most likely will be able to pair with rtx5090 without a bottleneck, not so sure about 13900k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if the 360 did fit in the front of the case, do you think i should go with that over the 280?",i’m concerned that doing so will prevent fresh air from getting to the gpu and other components.,or could i maybe exhaust out the front of the case with the rad?,or would it be better to stick with the 280 in the top and just have a lot of intake?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
500+ us$ motherboards should come with one of these out of the box.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as much as i enjoy building computers, in this case i would just upgrade the video card and possibly the psu (dependent on the video card recommendation).",the upgrade in cpu and ram won’t be that noticeable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cuz 5000s is great cpus and the new gen 7000/13th is expensive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that’s great.,but something you didn’t mention was your case.,a lot of people state how horrible their temps are yet they have a case with terrible air flow and/or poor or incorrect fan placement.,not saying this was your issue - but it’s a common one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i chose the rx 6700 xt over the 3070 cuz of difference price.,but 650w isn't enough?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes it will increase fps.,on my intel i5 1035g1 i doubled my fps just by adding another 8gb stick of ram (to a total of 16gb) but even then.,this is a pentium g4400.,don't expect miracles.,i'm not sure if your fps will double just like for me but it should be a big improvement.,"in your situation, you might also be limited just by capacity itself.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

in addition to what everyone else is saying (ram likelihood)... you should also upgrade to windows 11 to get the most out of kernel level improvements if you want bleeding edge performance.,iirc win10 doesn't have the latest thermal management support enabling per-core frequency boosts... as well as improvements to the process scheduler for p/e priorities.,at least that was true when i built my 12900ks at launch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"so you’re right that because intel cpus are monolithic, there’s a smaller latency penalty incurred when the e cores need to talk to the p cores on an intel system, vs when one ccx needs to talk to the other on an amd system.","but, broadly that’s a different set of issues than heterogenous processors - the issue in this thread is are the right processes being assigned to, in intel’s case, the p cores, and in amds case, the ccx which has v-cache.",disabling e cores or disabling the second ccx in both cases makes the processor functionally homogenous and ensures game-based processes run in the gaming-optimised part of the processor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it depends which programs and also which cpus.,"if you talk customer grade cpus (i9 vs r9) and you are talking about blender, then intel will win.",but productivity programs vary greatly so there a some where intel wins and some where amd wins.,"it also depends heavily on which features the cpu and the program supports for example avx 512.

so if you do productive work then you should know which program you are using and you can check what you need.","if you don't know the program, then you probably don't actually seriously plan to do productive work.","also if you are really using the cpu for work, then you are probably looking at something else entirely.",maybe something like epyc and there amd is usually much better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

check your aio and thermal paste... your values seems strange.,are you sure your pump is working fine.,after that you can try to undervolt your cpu => set a vcore offset in your bios to -0.1v you will gain \~10c temp and normally your system will be stable (you need to test).,you can fix turbo power limit (1 and 2) to 250w too (and decrease if needed).,but i think with the provided data that you have a cooling issue.,(aio not configured properly or really bad thermal paste job).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>i've never seen anything like that before so just wondering who set these numbers (it's an asus motherboard).,"it is the motherboard, on my msi's for example, it lets me choose the pl1 and pl2 based on my cooler the first time i enter the bios:

water cooler:pl1/pl2 4096w, current limit 512a

if i pick boxed cooler, my 13600k will be throttled because of the current limit, i had to manually change it to something higher.","with a proper undervolt, the cpu draws power nowhere near the intel's 181w under load.","if your cpu is drawing 250w, set pl to 181w, you will still get the best performance according to intel's specs and it will be easier to cool.","if you have a problem cooling it at 181w limit, rather than setting an even lower pl, look into undervolt instead.","that, or upgrade your cooler to something better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what other power profiles/specifications does intel provide other than the 181w power limits?,"the rest is up to the motherboard's manufacturer with whatever they deemed ""safe"".","when you put enough load on it, even without any auto overclocking the 13600k will draw more than 181w on most if not all motherboards with default settings, unless you set the power limit.",which is why undervolting is a thing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

its not undervolting if you are disabling auto-overclocking feature of motherboard.. its called running cpu at stock settings.,i agree on motherboard being safe at certain power but that's not the question.. the discussion was about how 13600k is going 252w at stock and its not stock.,cpu lite load 9 profile is intel default (i am not sure about this.,it could be 8 or 9).,similar feature is there for every motherboard.. its somewhat easier way to configure cpu load or underclocking if that's the word you prefer.,"i don't get your second paragraph, its a k series cpu it will overclock if motherboard setting is configured in that manner.",it can't magically bypass power limits unless your motherboard is configured in such manner.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"1. never use userbenchmark, it is full of false or misleading information

2. k series have unlocked clocks which mean you can overclock, and are generally tuned faster out of the box.","13700f has 2 extra performance cores, so i'd say it's the better option than the 13600k.",but it does cost like $50-100 more.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah i probably wouldn't have made this post if i didn't look at userbenchmark, because it said the i5 was ranked faster, despite the extra cores and clock speed of the i7.",so that had me a bit confused,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the newest rumors claim 14th gen on desktop is a refresh of 13th gen, so basically the same chip with slightly better clocks from better binning.","and tbh, it might not even end up being called ""14th gen"".",should be out by the end of 2024 regardless.,this would probably not use a new socket.,what you are referring to is meteor lake.,this would be 14th gen for mobile/laptop segments.,"whether it is coming to desktop or not is hotly contested, because it is on a new node.","regardless, this would almost certainly use a new socket.",it would also most likely be a huge upgrade in efficiency while retaining the same max frequencies as last gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

so i’m not too familiar with intel since i just started using 13th gen coming from amd.,so let’s say going from 10700 to 11700 has no benefit?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's not an answer.,"at msrp 11th gen was a waste of sand, but at current discounted prices an 11700k is a pretty good endgame cpu for that socket.","better single core, more ipc, and only a hair behind 10900k in multithread.",just runs a bit hot but limit it to 125w pl1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> no actual improvement in performance.,"https://youtu.be/pgjc-w8ggzu?t=306

more often than not, 11th gen was the bridge to match zen3 in gaming in 1% lows and stutter (the most important gaming metrics)

10th gen isn't *bad*, but once 11th gen prices came down it's not that bad.","it's objectively better than 10th gen, core for core.","i don't think anybody needs 10-core worth of fully-threaded loads, and if they do, they've moved on to 16+ core cpu by now.",gaming only needs 6-8 cores max.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that cpu is fine.,11th gen had an improvement to instructions per clock cycle of about 15% over 10th gen. the reason why reviewers skewered 11th gen chips was the relative price of them on launch compared to 10th gen performance and also what amd was doing at the time.,"they also have pcie gen 4 support whereas 10th gen is pcie gen 3, and the memory controllers are generally better with 11th gen.

for cpu data look at intel or amds websites for the specs.,"for the 13700f, vs k or kf the only difference is being able to overclock thr k skus.",thats it.,also the f means no igpu.,"so no k means no overclock, and the f sku means no igpu so you need a graphics card.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

dlvr is people not reading the patent properly(or at all).,the crux of the patent is a second voltage regulator that kicks in so the voltage doesn't sag when an unexpected demand happens.,the problem is that they want to switch from fivr to dlvr(which is a linear regulator) to reduce die space on the cpu.,"when the dlvr is active, the whole system is less efficient, not more.","so the gain for the second regulator is purely hypothetical in a sense that it gives you a guarantee, not the second regulator itself is efficient(because it does the opposite).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i had this issue before.,so i was always wondering why my cpu would suddenly reach 100% utilization and the temps would be so high even only during downloading a game on steam.,itd go like around 70-90ish.,"idle was around 40-50.

it is completely fine.,actually.,after sleeping on it.,i think you should just try to leave the overclock to the defaults (ie reset bios back to the defaults).,and instead turn on or off multi core enhancement in your bios settings.,"in your msi z790 board i think it is under ""enhanced turbo"" option.","[https://www.techpowerup.com/review/msi-mag-z790-tomahawk-wifi-ddr4/images/bios17.jpg](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/msi-mag-z790-tomahawk-wifi-ddr4/images/bios17.jpg)

you need to change the setting until the long and short power limit durations are at 253 watt and 125 watts.",here is more reading on controlling your wattage for your cpu.,and whether it is advisable to run at full power or at intel defaults of 253 watt and 125 watts.,"[https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/intel-core-i9-13900k-impact-of-multicore-enhancement-mce-and-long-power-duration-limits-on-thermals-and-content-creation-performance-2375/](https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/intel-core-i9-13900k-impact-of-multicore-enhancement-mce-and-long-power-duration-limits-on-thermals-and-content-creation-performance-2375/)

i think the choice depends on the end user.",and your workload.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the only only reason why amd and intel let their cpu runs at maximum power is because it is safe and the chips can handle that amount of power/heat/frequency.,these are high performing chips.,5ghz to 6ghz in speed.,and most end users now use water cooling.,and other exotic cooling methods.,"so rather than limit performance and assume every user will be using a heatsink w/fan, the motherboard manufacturers all assume that the end user will instead be equipping an aio (water cooling) unit on these chips instead.",as an aio is often many times quieter than heatsink+fan.,and it performs better too.,"because of this, motherboard manufacturers realize that performance will be left on the table.",so they unlock all the power.,and leave it unlocked.,they know that most users won't be running multiple cores at full tilt all the time.,it is a low probability that they have that kind of workload 24/7 daily.,"so in the rare case that a user will run cbr23 for benchmark, the chip will run at full tilt to get that high score.",high score is just for bragging rights.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the real answer is this - don’t buy alienware.,"i could list the *many* terrible design decisions and anti-consumer practices in their products that *actively cost the user in some cases ~20% of the performance they paid for*, and also make the systems impossible to upgrade or repair in any capacity whatsoever, but gamers nexus did it best: https://youtu.be/unvxskqj8ic

buy from literally any other company, or, ideally, build your own - it takes a little while, but it’s doable (pcs really only have about eight parts you need to put together, and their layout is really intuitive) and gives you far better value than anything prebuilt can.","i prefer the linus tech tips build guide video, but here’s one that outlines the assembly process: https://youtu.be/qkr07cuthru (don’t use youtube build tutorials to choose parts - you should get your information for choosing your parts directly from product reviews.)",just tell me your budget and i’ll get a draft part list ready for you that will blow that alienware out of the water.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1 case fan missing shouldn't cause that kind of temperature people used to run these cpu's in itx cases with poor airflow and stock coolers and still not get temps that high.,if the internal tim is shot you will need to de lid the cpu to re paste it which is quite risky and i wouldn't reccomend doing so if you aren't comfortable with it.,what are you using now to measure cpu temperature?,windows resource monitor or some kind of game overlay?,"open hardware monitor, core temp and even some vendor specific programs can show you the temperature of each core and not just the package temperature.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

agreed and i'd also add that the 40series nvidia gpus all have frame gen (dlss3) as well which extends your frame rate even further to almost double the frame rate while still being pretty responsive.,"i play lots of single player games that have frame gen and i have nothing but good things to say about frame gen. 

frame gen technically adds a little latency by calculating the average image between 2 precalculated native frames to add in additinal frames so it's not recommended for competitive first person shooters but i also only play single player campaigns on those games so same difference for me.","it's nice having options though and one way or another even on games like cyberpunk at full settings with ray tracing you can get over 60fps ""native"" with frame gen even up to 4k.",however dlss2 upscaling to quality not only speeds up rendering but can add additional visual fidelity im some instances so you have even more options for getting more fps with higher resolutions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ultimately there’s not a whole lot in the way of cooling in the world that can successfully cool a 13900k in stock form.,"so those temps you have are about what you should expect, the other thing is that’s in a benchmark tool, you will very unlikely put that kind of load on yourself.","you should be able to push that undervolt to -100mv which may get your temps in the high 80’s, that would be optimal if you don’t lose much in cinebench points.",basically the cpu is designed when it’s under stress like cinebench to keep pushing the power up as long as it doesn’t thermal throttle.,so basically it will ride 99c if it can by choice.,"and while it’s designed to go to 100c, do t be mistaken that these temps are still not good for extended periods of time.","just because it can, doesn’t mean it should live at 99c all day everyday, it wasn’t designed to do that despite what some think.","you can ride that red line while say unpacking a large game file and installing it over 20-30 mins, should it be that compressed.","that’s a perfectly okay use case for high temps but not if your playing games at 99c for hours everyday, lower temps will always be better regardless.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ahhh prime95.,do some googling.,there are some articles about major testers moving away from the tool since it can generate so much heat.,it's so good with tight avx assembly loads that it can turn on the entire cpu in ways almost no other real thing can.,i'd offer person numbers but i did the same googling when i got a 12900k and saw similar extremes.,the articles are useful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

imo of gaming is your primary use i’d go with the 13700k.,still has eight performance cores which is plenty for gaming and has eight efficiency cores if you happen to do anything that takes advantage of those.,"the gap between the 13600k, 13700k and 13900k is fairly small for gaming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"first off, chuck prime95 out of the window.",it's not a useful test unless your goal is stress testing your cooling system.,it's a completely unrealistic load.,use something like occt medium variable to see a more real-world load.,"second, the 13900k is a hot chip, period.",it's going to be hot no matter what you do unless you want to do some fun stuff (not recommended for most people).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there are many factors to that but to simplify things it just mean that the user experience is only going down because the hardware will remain the same along with it's current capabilities while the software keeps getting more demanding and would tax the hardware more and more through out the years.","so in order to keep up with future demanding software people tend to ""overspec"" their hardware to compensate for future software system requirements and therefore will give them a consistent user experience for ""x"" amount of years instead of only the 1st year of the computer's build.","&#x200b;

technology becomes irrelevant really fast.,"when they say it will become obsolete in 5 years, they ain't lying.",take for example my ipad 4th generation from 2012/2014.,it is today a complete brick unable to even play youtube correctly from the web browser.,why is it obsolete?,well i don't know.,but it could be because apple no longer provides ipad os updates to it.,it is stuck on ios ver.,"10 while the entire appstore ecosystem has moved on and updated to ios ver 16+

so we just don't know.",technology always becomes obsolete.,intel/amd/nvidia however are very good at keeping older technology working still.,windows/msft get some bonus points to.,just for comparison.,an i7 8700k featured 6c/12 threads in 2017 (6 years ago).,that i7 8700k was the top dog for 8th gen (we are on 13th today) and there was no i9 back then.,i9 back then was the i7 8700k.,"i9 launched as 9900k for 9th gen. 

today the i9 13900k is 24c/32t and the i7 13700k is 16c/24t.","an i7 8700k won't be completely obsolete like my ipad 4th gen from 2014. but with the passage of time and the constant pursuit of technology, we just don't know.","ai today can design our logos, art work, games, and talk to us.",so no one knows.,my best advice is to just save your money.,pay for technology frugally and do not fall for nvidia's marketing.,"a 2080 should have msrped for $599 but today a 4080 msrp for $1,259 to $1,590",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

how im explain ?,"xeons for coffe lake ( for servers and movile version ) are almost identical like desktop version, the few diferences is igp and unlock somes features like virtual pro, and all feautures from this generation intel 

you can run xeons coffe time in desktop motherboards since chipset c223 is a b150 o other variants and shared sames microcodes ( aka in 6th gen mobos kaby lake you can put on processors  8th/9th gen with pin mod and bios mod since you add microcodes since is same socket lga 1151 ) , the only downside is you need old version of intel magnament engine (11.50.7 from 2017 or more older ) and disabled.","mobile versions of xeons need a adapter pcb board to make compatible with desktop lga 1151 

already exist many guides to 6th/7th gen for used coffe lake in this mobos, xeons and mutants cpu ( mobile procesors )

the reaso why mutants procesors ( mobile cpu with adapter board ) exist is cuz are moar cheap vs retail /second hand/engeniering version cpus

1. relevant for the highest settings gaming.,"2. considering my i7-6700k from 2015 is still working great as a programming computer, and could be easily refurbished as a high end office pc, yes, the 13500 which is up to 4x as fast will definitely work for a good 10 years at least as an office pc with some gaming on the side.",3. intel has an interesting roadmap coming up with a lot of new nodes.,cpus are going to become more efficient and have more and more threads.,it's more likely that an upgrade to a faster ssd down the line will improve your performance in a meaningful way.,we still have rather slow random read / write speeds compared to sequential.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah but you miss what he’s actually saying if you pay attention and i’ve watched this video many many times from the moment it came out.,"the way it’s designed is like i said, it’s designed to hit those temps in bursts, not to be sustained.","like he explains, he’s looking at it primarily from a performance point of view, instead of taking 20-30 mins to saturate the chip, it’s designed to to have a far quicker and denser power curve that it can’t sustain.","this is done so you can hit higher frequencies faster to get a work load done, but it’s like a car in the sense you your holding the gas until it gets to red line and then your completely releasing it again.","doing that over and over is how they have designed it, and keep in mind that only applies in high enough work loads that take advantage of higher frequencies.","they have not designed it to sit at limiter and bash it until the work is done, and gaming wouldn’t fall under that high work load category either.","the statement of 100c is fine for long periods of time is absolutely not what he said, he was talking about bursts in heavy work loads.","his example was video editing and photoshop, and the only part about that work load that will take advantage is the final render load.","so it’s not the part of actually editing for hours that  it applies to, it primarily applies to the last leg of that work load.",and if you notice debaurer also mentions temps and they both agree that cooler is always better regardless.,the only reason i watched that video over and over and read so much about all these temps and 13th gen is because what is said is often misleading.,"the problem is, so many people are going around saying oh yeah no worries, just throw any old basic air cooler on the 13900k and itl be fine because it’s meant to sit at 100c.","i’m not saying that you agree with exactly that, but it’s that misunderstood information that leads people to believe it’s still appropriate to cool a super hot chip with a box cooler.","just because it sees 100c more often, doesn’t mean that it’s capable or good for the chip to sit at 100c for long periods of time.","and due to this design, is precisely why liquid cooling is more suitable.","liquid cooling handles those extremely fast temperature rises much better than air coolers do, regardless of cooling ability, it’s the way liquid handles that heat when it hits the gas.","everyone knows going from 0-100 and then 100-0 very fast is one way to destroy something quickly, with liquid, that spike isn’t so violent.","and with the design of these chips literally, liquid hasn’t made more sense than it does now.","i’m sure you will begin to see what i’ve said make more sense, the more you think about it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i've heard people say that their a770 performs just as good as their 3070 or 6700xt.,it's really depends on the game.,"ltt did a full 30 day review (by linus and luke) where, after the latest driver updates, they didn't have anything bad to say about the performance.","they still swapped back to their nvidia top tier cards, but a770 wasn't supposed to be a top tier card.","i think in the next few releases, intel will have, or be extremely close to having a top tier card.",i really hope they get it figured out.,i will say that if i didn't already have a 3070. i would have picked up a a770 16gb card.,they are almost half the price of my 3070 when i bought it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i say go for it.,i recently upgraded from 6700k to 13600k and it has been insane how smooth my pc runs now no matter what i'm throwing at it.,i paired it with a b760 tomahawk board.,i'd suggest you to go with a b660 tomahawk or b660m mortar.,"if you want to avoid msi, b660 aorus master is a great choice too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

tldr i use the rog maximus z790 hero with 4x48gb dimm of 5200 corsair c38 memory.,asus has a website where they verify ram configs.,technically my config was approved for 2 dimms but mine still runs on 4. yours is cleared for 2 dimms by my motherboard but maybe 4 will work.,it is not verified though.,there are good options for running 4 dimm out there.,i think some higher timings are the problem and the higher the ram speed the harder it is to use 4 dimms.,between the higher speeds and each dimm being dual channel it brings not only the challenge of using higher speed memory but also integrating data moving across 8 ram channels at that speed too which requires more overhead.,i wonder if switching your ram would be easier.,i had to decrease the speed and increase the latency of my ram to get a working config with 4 dimms but it actually resulted in an overall performance increase compared to 2 dimms probably due to more parrallel throughput.,just some thoughts from my experience.,i also saw corsair has an option on new egg for that ram speed of 6600 with a better c32 running in 2 dimm.,there are different ways to approach your problem.,i get you may not be able to return your ram though so just sharing options.,"oh also, if you dont enable xmp then you can probably get 4 dimm to run on more motherboards.",i think many default to something like 4800mt/s so just another option.,i'm pretty sure i could run anything on 4dimm on my board of xmp isnt enabled but xmp is usually why you buy 6600 ram so i get that might not be preferred.,eventually they will get better with using faster ram so you have now vs later you can consider with that kit too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it is probably okay.,id expect the actual life span of the device to be lowered than if you ran the part at say 85c but that will always be the case for any electronic.,if intel specifies its okay to operate at tjmax then i would expect so as well.,they most likely qualify the part for the listed temperature and add in some safety margin to the actual rating.,you could always email their technical support asking if 100c is safe for the part for extended use just to be sure.,id actually recommend this since traditionally we know that 100c for intel chips was bad but i think the 13th gen is rated higher than usual on tjmax.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"did amd also recently say that the cpu actually performs better at higher temperatures, around 90°c?",i feel there is likely a physics explanation about electrical resistance or something.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it affects both so rarely it should not be a consideration.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,unless you want to leave performance on the table.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but running @ 100°c = thermal throttling.,and if you are thermal throttling you're also leaving performance on the table.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

even at 100c the cpu will survive but it will start to  reduce speed to remain at 100c to prevent the temperature going higher than 100.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that makes sense now its weird because i always believed what you just said but i stopped ocing because i hit my thermal throttle of my watercooler but i went more a couple weeks after and i cracked almost 40k on cinebench 5k over my last score and it was throttling during my record score 13900k https://ibb.co/ysrwxz5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"with 64 gb of ddr5 memory at 6400 mt/s (3200 mhz), first boot after ac loss causes memory training and usually takes about 20 seconds.",subsequent booting time is \~6 seconds before displaying the rog logo.,it's probably due to having so much memory and using ddr5.,it never really concerned me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
from what i’ve read is the difference is the ak620 has a cover over the end of the heat sinks which the ag620 doesn’t.,fwiw i have a corsair 4000d and the ak620 fits like a glove,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it depends on your sample and the voltages your mobo sets by default.,"the core vids are different from one sample to the next depending on how it tested in production, so some cpus will need more power than others to maintain full clocks in cinebench.",my guess is you're hitting the power limits and throttling.,my 13900k needs about 320w to not throttle in cb at bios defaults.,it scores just over 40k.,but it would be lower if i limited it to 253w.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
p-cores (performance) and e-cores (efficiency) are completely different designs and will run at different respective temperature ranges.,your cpu looks fine.,an 8 degree delta in the p-cores is perfectly normal.,e-cores look very good as well.,at higher temps you would probably see something like a 10 degree delta within the p-cores and that is perfectly normal as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"as a former 2450m owner, and ""gamer"", i know what you mean, i had an acer 5750g with it, it died after bout 4 years but that was something else than the cpu, i actually gave the cpu to someone with a i3 2310m and he been using that cpu for quite a while after that

all i know is that without one of those usb laptop coolers, it was at 96°c running old source engine games (half life 2, counter strike source, ..)

i had a crude desk setup which wasn't really a desk, but the laptop was sitting on a closet which had another sort of closet mounted ontop of it using metal l brackets, without the laptop cooler that metal l bracket got so hot, even while sitting 10cm away from the laptop exhaust you could burn your hand on it

those old laptops had pga socket cpu's tho which means they were not soldered, and thus had no issues breaking solder balls

my i7 desktop gets nowhere near that hot, i think most i've seen is 80 (on a very overclocked 6700k) during prime95",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"at defaults pl1 pl2 = 253 and icc 307a i get 36,000

it's a normal score.",the chip throttles way to early and runs very cool if you use these defaults.,"however if you run it with an unlimited pl1 pl2 and 512a, you can get 39k to 40k in cinebench r23.",when you run it unlimited the cpu will use 300w to 320w and hit 100c and throttle itself to maintain 100c.,now you can undervolt it and get the chip to peak at 90c to 95c but you are undervolting it.,"for example if i set cpu lite mode to mode 7, i can run stable with a slight undervolt that keeps temps in that range while still giving me 40k in cinebench.","but...

as far as i can tell, if you run intel's stock values of pl1 pl2 at 253 and the stock 307a... the cpu will not boost up to it's max frequencies under all core loads due to it seeing 253watts as the limit the chip should avoid at all costs.","it just doesnt boost even if the chip is at 70 to 80c, despite the headroom.","it will do it's best to avoid 253watts, no matter what your cpu's temp is.",this sucks.,this is why people run them unlimited because you're losing performance from intel's boosting curve.,i haven't figured out how to get the damn thing to run better at stock values but... at least you know there is absolutely no way you will hurt the 13900k running intel's stock pl1 pl2 253 and 307a icc.,you will just be giving up a lot of performance.,"if you can cool the cpu at 253w pl1 and pl2 easily, then run it with a 300w or 320w pl1 pl2 with an icc of 400a.",thats the 13900ks's pl1 pl2 and icc value.,they are essentially the same chips.,my chip can run just fine at ks values when overclocked.,it's not like the ks is going to significantly out perform the k because the k is already at it's thermal limits just like the ks will be when you run it at 5.5 all p core and 4.3 all e cores at full load.,"this is why motherboard manufactures like msi default to unlimited pl1 pl2 and 512a when you select ""watercooling"".",it will run 5.5ghz (p) and 4.3ghz (e) all core with a 360 or 420 aio.,basically if you can cool it the chip will boost itself as much as it can based on the thermal headroom up and when it reaches 100c it will throttle back to maintain max frequency at max thermals.,"the question that remains though... has intel told motherboard makers that this is ok to do, or is it something that could possibly degrade the chip long term, and if so how long?","if we look at intel's stock pl1 pl2 and power settings of 307a, thats very conservative.",they clearly are thinking about 100% long term reliability and i think are too conservative.,intel knows it too.,remember this is an unlocked cpu designed to be tinkered and overclocked.,it's also designed to run as fast and as reliable long term which is why the stock settings are so conservative.,"i think intel and performance /enthusiast motherboard makers talk to each other quite a bit about what is ""safe"" and what isn't.",i think that's why highend board makers default to unlimited on most gaming boards.,gamers aren't likely to keep this cpu for 10 years in a mission critical machine.,"by the time it degrades (if it ever does), you will have bought something significantly faster.",that's what gamers do :) thats what content creators do also.,"btw i can run 2 p cores at 6 ghz, and all p cores at 5.7 with all ecores at 4.5ghz and get a higher cinebench score.","i get 42,000 when i do this.",the interesting thing though is the chips behavior.,"the chip will still hit 100c and throttle just like it will at 5.5/4,3 all core in cinebench.",the difference is at 5.7/4.5 all core the cpu will ramp up to those clocks before it reaches 100c and that very brief window gives you a better benchmark score.,"now of course when it hits 100c, it throttles back down to 5.5/4.3 or 5.4/4.2 even but you can still get a better score :) is it worth it?",i dont know.,i dont think it is but its funny imo.,again combine that with cpu lite mode 7 (undervolting) and you can get these scores but really it's diminishing returns.,39k at 5.5/4.3 with pl1 pl2 unlimited and icc at 512a isn't going to be much difference in reality.,at some point we're chasing numbers and not real performance.,you can configure this chip how you want... and it seems unlimited pl1 pl2 and 512a is the easiest way to get the most out of the chip with watercooling.,"that's why board makers default to these values most of the time when selecting ""watercooling"" in the bios.",otherwise the default pl1 pl2 253 and 307a intel stock values are way too conservative for an aio but are perfectly fine for dog shit heatsink fan coolers.,if you have a good noctua heatsink with dual fans you'll likely find the stock values disappointingly conservative just like aio users will.,although i havent tested the 13900k with a noctua heat sink fan to know for certain myself.,i imagine noctua cools it just fine at default settings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

old school computers had cpu's that didn't produce anywhere near as much heat, the 486 (windows 95 etc times) had a tdp of 5w, the pentium 2 was like 24w max, the 8600k probly consumes 80w+ stock

i think its just dependant on your silicon quality.,it sounds about right.,idk if it was a bug but i noticed that for me if i limited my cpu to 253 it would only consume around 220w and only do allcore of 5ghz.,which is why i say dependant on silicon quality since i think my cpu refuses to do more within 250w.,"when i unlock my pl everything stock it will go all the way to 350w to do 5.5ghz all core...i did an - offset voltage of 0.09 and it went down to around 320w, much lower temps.",i think i may have gotten a dud of a chip lol.,"just my findings, you'll have to read the experiences of others to form any conclusions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

bottlenecking is a different thing.,it means a component is holding back your computer and it's not performing at its absolute best.,"the 8400 can be a bottleneck in modern games, but not due to the 65w power limit.",it's the 6 cores and 6 threads configuration that is holding you back (8th gen apart from the 8700k didn't have hyperthreading).,couple that with the mediocre frequency of the 8400 (i think it is somewhere around 3.7ghz when utilizing all 6 cores) and you get a mediocre experience.,"though it is still a serviceable cpu if you are targeting 60 fps, but don't expect to hit 144 with it in modern games even with a 4090, you need a 12th gen i5 or a 5600x at least to get anywhere close to that.",depending on your needs it might be time to upgrade.,6c/6t cpu's unfortunately didn't age well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

your 8400 at \~3.8ghz consumes significantly less power than running the same cpu at 5ghz (i.e.,8600k/9600k overclocked).,"power increase is not linear, and these 5ghz ones will likely be doing 70-100w while you use 45.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that's a decent combo.,are you having any stutters?,if not and you are able to reach your target framerate there is no reason to upgrade.,"if you decide to upgrade the cpu and keep the same mobo don't go for a 9700k, it lacks hyperthreading and you will eventually face the same limitations the 8400 already does in many games (and afaik the 9700k is already facing them in the new games as well).","either go for a 9900k or get a 12th/13th gen i5, any cpu from 8th or 9th gen other than the 9900k isn't worth the money.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is more than likely an issue with the 7900xtx.,radeon cards for as far back as i can remember and present day do not play nicely with hardware accelerated tasks.,most radeon users fix a large portion of these issues by disabling hardware acceleration in everything.,running your hardware accelerated tasks exclusively on the monitor connected to the igpu should fix your performance problems.,i highly recommend keeping the igpu enabled anyways as it's no slouch when it comes to encoding and decoding and if you ever stream you should be using qsv over vce(?),as it provides better quality output at the same bitrates without sapping any resources from your gpu.,"the only exception to this rule of using qsv over your gpu encoder is the day streaming platforms start supporting streaming using av1 since your gpu does support av1 encoding but the igpu doesn't and av1 provides much better quality at lower bitrates versus h.264/265

edit: as someone who owns a rtx 4090 i can say that unless i'm recording, i do any encoding with the igpu for streaming purposes (which doesn't require actively connecting a monitor to your igpu).",i've tested current gen nvenc and qsv side by side at the same bit rate and qsv produces a better quality stream with no performance hit in game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

tbh even a i5 is capable of doing good work in editing cases.,of course i7 and i9 are faster due to core and thread count but also costs more.,"if your budget allows it, choose based on your budget.",all 3 cpus are really good.,"if the 100$ more won't hurt you, the i7 would be my choice.",8p + 8e cores.,powerful gaming cpu and really good for anything else.,if you don't plan on using the igpu get yourself a kf cpu and save another 30-40$.,the 13600k/f is still a very powerful cpu and should easily fit your needs.,all depends on your budget and how important it is to you how fast those workloads are finished.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

pump doesn't matter too much.,d5 and ddc pumps that are commonly used are fine.,i use alphacool d5 compatible pump which is quieter than the d5 i had previously.,manufacturer brand of the parts doesn't really matter much either.,differences are very minor.,just pick some reputable brand that looks good to you.,pretty much everyone uses the same threading so parts are compatible.,as long as you don't mix aluminum and copper.,size of reservoir mainly affects how easy the system is to fill and how fast the coolant reaches saturation temperature in high intensity workloads.,pick one that fits to the case nicely and looks good.,with radiators more is more.,i think you could technically fit three radiators into that case but i would personally go with one 360mm at the bottom and one at the top and mount a pump reservoir combo on the side radiator mounting.,the bottom radiator probably prevents mounting gpu vertically but i don't like that anyways.,there are a lot of different radiators.,the main parameters are size (so area and thickness) and fpi (fins per inch).,in general bigger cools better.,higher fin density offers better maximum cooling but can be worse with lower air pressure at low fan speeds.,there are tradeoffs in different choices.,then there are x-flow radiators where the ports are at different ends if that fits your tube runs better.,hard tubing is hard.,soft tubing is easy.,i used to do hard tubing but after third time i had to rebend tubes after changing some component i decided hard tubing is stupid.,there are youtube tutorials for what all the measures in tubes and fittings mean but you can just pick them from the same manufacturer to make checking compatibility easy.,it's good to measure twice and cut once.,i have a habit of measuring once and then cutting twice and measuring again accompanied with some profanities.,it's a lot easier if you plan well and make sure everything fits before you start building.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i just built a new pc with the i5 13500 and cooled by a cooler master hyper 212 led turbo argb rr-212tk-18pa-r1.,"the included fans were whiny so i just fitted a couple of arctic p12 pwm pst fans instead, they spin a bit slower but are basically inaudible.",i noted today during cinebench 23 testing for 10 minutes the cpu never got above 69 degc.,it got up there pretty fast and stayed there.,multicore score was about 20700 by the way.,if yours was less is might be thermal throttling.,"100deg really seems too high, maybe contact surfaces arent completely parallel.","maybe remove fan, clean surfaces, apply a really thin film of good thermal paste for testing, then fit it and remove it again and check that the disturbance in the paste is uniform.","i'll also mention that the instructions for fitting the captive screws and the plastic caps on the frame that goes under the board, as well as the hex standoffs on the topside was really unclear in the manual (the hex blocks were not even shown in the diagrams).",and the side with the washers goes on the pcb side to prevent damage to it.,make sure you got that part right.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

sorry i missed it..... but i really appreciate your help!,"i have had phone calls and numberous emails with their business account managers about my specific needs.......

&#x200b;

1. i9 3900k with integrated igu 770 (as i need two separate gpus, one for transcoding which i would use the 770 for and discrete video card for vm and gaming)
2. ecc memory
3. several sata port (it will be a nas too).",this comes with 5 but also pci slots so i can more.,"4. discrete nvidia card
5. at least a 1,000w power supply

this is about as close as i could hope for (though i could always want more like 3 more pci slots....lol)

here is what i highlighted as the specs i am asking from dell from the manual

"if you are using cpu lite load via msi, it is important to follow these recommend steps from msi.",leave cpu load line to 1 value.,"say level 4. https://forum-en.msi.com/faq/article/cpu-lite-load

leave cpu voltage to auto\*.",cpu lite load does this.,"&#x200b;

|cpu ll 1|5.4 ghz, 5.0ghz, 4.7ghz|1.25v, 1.2v, 1.15v|
|:-|:-|:-|
|cpu ll 2|5.4 ghz, 5.0ghz, 4.7ghz|1.27v, 1.22v, 1.17v|
|cpu ll 3|5.4 ghz, 5.0ghz, 4.7ghz|1.29v, 1.24v, 1.19v|
|cpu ll 4|5.4 ghz, 5.0ghz, 4.7ghz|1.31v, 1.26v, 1.21v|
|etc.......|||

those aren't exact values.",but it pretty much adjusts voltage for all your frequencies.,"because your cpu can do 5.4ghz, 5.3, 5.2, 5.1, and so on.",voltage adjusts for each value too.,one value of cpu lite load will adjust all freq versus voltage.,just fix cpu load line.,set cpu voltage to auto\*\*\*\*\* any manual voltages commands will conflict with cpu lite load commands.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it can do up to 4.8 on a single core load, 4.7 if it's not fully maxed out, and 4.6 is the max all core if i'm not mistaken.",you're basically already getting the most out of it.,you can overclock the bclk to push it a bit further but only a handful of boards with a special external clock generator will allow you to significantly boost anything.,i believe the z490i unify has such a feature for example.,"otherwise you can't overclock it past 3%, usually the setting caps out at 102.9 or so.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

wow its almost like there’s not a fan or cooler on it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ima be honest with you its not worth it my 3200 cl16 kit fails before the cpu does at 102.5. slightly under volt it and just crank the power so it holds the boost.,i have a 10900f i tried everything with a asus z590m prime micro atx board no luck.,even when it work i can't see the gain in cinebench,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"5600 will be fine

non-k 12th/13th gen cpu:s have a locked sa voltage which does limit ram overclocking a bit, so for ddr5 the limit usually somewhere between 6000-6400mt/s(max i've seen on a benchmark is 6550mt/s) and for ddr4 it's somewhere between 3200-3600.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"nope, clock speeds stay the same, just less power is supplied and as many found out now, that much power is not needed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you probably used enough force to make the cpu completely flat and perfectly touch the cooling plate of your cooler!,those with less strength need a contact frame lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"well, i would suggest getting an ssd large enough to copy all that data over, so that everything opens instantly instead of using a slow hard drive for storage, which also makes the build quieter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well i got a 4090 and learned that ocing an i7 gets you to stock i9 performance and i don't need a thousand cores to play games,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i assume also in different slots with the one at a time?,"your approach so far seems sound, kind of a nasty bit of trouble on your hands.",reminds me of a jayztwocents vid he did recently for one of his viewers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"right, do you think an i9 can't be overclocked?",i've got my 13900k running at 6.0 ghz on the p-cores with tvb,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're comparing two different generations and two different tiers.,the 11600kf is both a newer generation (11th vs 10th) and a higher tier (600 vs 400).,"the k are a little more expensive because it's unlocked for overclocking, and clocked a bit higher.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
