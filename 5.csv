i am using thermal grizzly contact frame and thermal gizzly kyronaut paste with my 13700k and cm pl360 flux aio.,"my idle temps are 30c, cinebench23 multithreaded load test 30 minutes averages 86c, and gaming temps range from 45-60c.",all this inside a closed corasir 5000x case.,i've also capped the power limits to intel's max 253watts in bios.,"i strongly recommend contact frames, they seem to work very well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can someone explain to me what a contact frame is?,is it a substitute for thermal paste?,something that goes under it??,id love to lower my temps that much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
meanwhile i'm getting same thermals on my 12400f as i did on my 10600k on idle and the random load spikes are about the same even with a slightly higher load voltage also using a d-15.,maybe some motherboards loading mechanism just really sucks.,"41c also sounds pretty high, but i'm assuming you're maybe running fixed voltage as that would explain that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

10â° reduction with the 13600k too?,"that's crazy

is it because the cooler does contact with the frame too and more heat is exchanged?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no delid?,"u got what i have in my plan, hows the temp in game?",cpu settings?,oc?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's a replacement for the stock intel clamp that holds the cpu in place.,it applies equal pressure over the cpu so that the cooler has complete contact to ensure the best cooling.,the current stock intel clamp applies too much pressure to one side that can actually warp/bend the cpu lid so that the cooler has terrible contact.,look up the gamers nexus video on the contact frame.,"you can get them on amazon for like $14, it's a no brainer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my 13700k idles mid 30 as well around with a fc140.,i did install a contact frame and it made no difference in temps for me.,i assume if i had a aio i would get lower temps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they're cheap af?,how is it not worth?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you looking at the same images as me?,12-22c drop is not worth $10?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yup iâ€™m getting a little lower than that on a 13900k without the contact mount.,his first mount was just garbage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but we don't know anything about the case cooling or the ambient temperatures of either the op or even yours for that matter.,important information that seemingly everyone forgets to mention.,it's one thing if we were talking about deltas but since we are mentioning absolutes then it's important to mention the other temperatures.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hey i also have a 12700k (deepcool ak620) and i'm trying to figure out if i screwed up the install somehow.,running at 70â°-80â° at a realistic (game) load and i get up to 100â°c with prime95 fft benchmarks.,what are your temps under load?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i don't use the contact frame, and i have a similar cooler.",i don't even come near thermal throttling point.,so you shouldn't either realistically.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">load temps don't really matter if i, say, run cb23 multi because with or without the contact frame i'll thermal throttle either way.","still, if it throttles to 5.2 ghz with the frame but throttles to say 4.8 ghz without the frame, that's still worth considering.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've got my 13900k under a d15s.,it doesn't throttle in cinebench r23 with a 288w power limit and nothing else.,i haven't fitted the contact frame yet either.,"still returns 39,000 vs ~40k and change delimited.","throttling isn't a given, just needs a few settings tweaks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"so get the more expensive part that has no advantages, only far more difficult to mount?",why?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12 / 13 series needs more than a dot compared to older chips.,the chip is bigger.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, dot in the middle isn't enough.",with the bigger chips it's best to do an x with a extra dot in the middle.,then you guarantee good coverage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50c at idle means an air layer between ihs and the heatsink.,reminds me of this one where they didn't follow noctua's paste application instructions and dropped 20c at full load after a remount with the correct procedure.,https://www.reddit.com/r/intel/comments/y50aax/need_i9_12900k_undervolting_help/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">the thermaltight ones are afaik violating patents from thermal grizzly

"this wasn't mentioned in the gn video, and indeed the shape is different.","the thermalright frame actually makes contact with the mobo unlike the thermalgrizzly which can be overtightened and can bend the pins - i'd choose the thermalright even at the same price, it is the better product.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"very nice, i'm looking at a fractal torrent case with a noctua d15 and a 13600k.","my understanding is that the ak620 is very similar, so curious on what to expect.","i've been leaning towards a liquid arctic 360 or 420, but aio seems silly for the torrent case and 420 can't really fit my current case.",appreciate the follow up!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but is it hard though ?,"i saw the gamer nexus video review of this, not the thermal grizzly one... is it really that easy ?","i mean, im good with tools, that little counter clockwise turn to find the thread, trick.... i figure that out back when i was like 15 yr old lol...

i don't know hows other ppl experience but i had it lying flat.,i have lancool mesh 2 performance and the backplate still felt off.,you either need to hold it one hand and screw in at least 1 screw with other hand or - what i would recommend for stress free experience - ask somebody to hold it for you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i just bought this exact motherboard to go with my 13600k.,"it was pretty easy to flash the bios, all you have to do is download the latest one on a usb stick, plug in your psu and push the q-flash button on the mobo.",the whole thing took like 5 minutes to install.,the only thing i have to say is that make sure you have the right screwdriver for the m.2 screws.,"hopefully, the ones i bought on amazon will work when they come in today.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
get a z690 or z790 so you can oc the 13600k it has a ton of headroom.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you will need a last gen cpu to flash the bios on the motherboard for it to work.,"750w psu is cutting it close, might need to set a power limit on the cpu in bios to avoid overstressing the psu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have the same exact board.,i have not built my new rig yet but for sure will need to update the bios because i bought the mobo back in august of this year.,i watched a few yt videos and the one thing i recommend is buy a usb thumb drive with active light indicators because it helps visually see that the thumb drive is being read when the lights start flashing also the mobo has a flashing light as well when it is running the bios update.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, get a z690 or z790",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so should i update the bios on the first boot ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i panic bought a corsair 1000w psu to go with my 13700k 3080 12gb setup.,"i was running a 8600k 4.8 3080 12gb for quite some time on a 650w but some testing showed 460w-ish draw from the wall under stress testingâ€¦80w cpu

when i seen the reviews of the 13700k pulling up to 240w stress testing a back of the napkin check meant upgrading psu

i know those kinds of loads are not realistic for gaming use but i also know psus have an efficiency curve which i would be steering quite closely to the upper limit and running it hard

plus, i thought if i manage to get away with not upgrading now theres now way a 650w would cut it for the next round of upgrades so why not just do it now so theres less stress next time

anyways that was a bit of a ramble.",tell me i made the right decisions ðÿ˜…,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

z boards (good ones) are expensive af though .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
counter-point: this board has a lot of usb ports,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"depending on the bios version it comes with, it may not post without a bios update, as when the mobo came out 13th gen cpus weren't out yet.","basically, if it starts up properly, you shouldn't need a bios update, you'll be more or less good to go.","if it doesn't start up, all is not lost.","if it has bios flashback you just need a usb with the latest bios and you have to find  the bios flashback instructions for it, if not you'll need to borrow a 12th gen cpu from a friend, or go to a pc shop so they update the bios for you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the bios update for 13th gen is f20a released on 10/11/22.,i would go ahead and make a thumb drive for it.,the q-flash on these is super simple.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm not sure which bios the motherboard ships with.,i'm assuming they ship with f4 according to this [cpu support list](https://www.gigabyte.com/motherboard/b660-aorus-master-ddr4-rev-10/support#support-cpu).,"i would assume that it would not be able to recognize the 13th gen out of the box, but i don't know personally.","in my case, i was upgrading both my mobo and psu, so both were new and out of the case which made using the q-flash plus feature simple for me.","but if you are already using the board with a 12th gen chip at the moment, you may be able to upgrade the bios that way or take it to a local pc shop as some others have suggested

edit: updated mobo context",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"what do you think i have been doing, browsing the web?",ofcourse i used the system with the 4090 to game with.,"4090 is a monster, the i9 is such a bottleneck.","like i said, my gainward is using the ref pcb design with the worst transient spikes/ripples out there of the 4090 yet there is no issues what so ever.","i dont need to care about if i have any headroom or not, if i do need then i go and buy a new psu but yeah, i rather do my own testing and dont bother too much about people trying to convince others on some issues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that would be my choice and probably will be!,i agree with your thinking here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thereâ€™s no harm in having more headroom and, as you noted, all signs point to more demanding hardware in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i switched from a 5950x rtx 3090 to the 13700k rtx 3090 and just that was too much for my 750w psu with games crashing and full pc restarts when gaming, ive upgraded to a 1000w now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"good choice man, i also just bought a 1000w psu from be quite (dark power 12) for my upcoming 13700k + 3080 ti build, i always say: better save than sorry!",lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just a word of advice, check out the gigabyte z690 auros elite ax instead, 

same io, 4 nvme slots instead of 3, better connectivity overall due to z690 chipset,

and even if you dont plan on oc, the z- chipset allows you to change voltages which is crucial for ram stability (ive heard some ram kits cant do past 3600/ 3800 on ddr4 b660 mbs/ with intels non kskus)

its same price, way better features.",just check out before going with the b660,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my only have the 3x8pin plugs, so in afterburner i cant change the powerlimit to anything more tha 100%, yet it runs 2700mhz all day long and even oc to 3000mhz without any issues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah just build with a b board if that's what you can afford and whatever you're looking to do anyways.,"too often people recommend the z690/790 and people don't end up oc'ing anyways, so... get the b660!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the aorus master is gigabyte's flagship.,there are plenty of boards with better (z) chipsets at lower prices.,"the msi pro z690-a, for example.",though it wouldn't have as many features as the flagship obviously.,"in my experience z chipsets typically run k processors at lower temperatures in general, but it could just be a fluke i've been experiencing all my life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no reason, op just doesn't know what they're talking about",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you just asked if this mobo is good for 13600k i answered also i was having an issue with b660 and a 12600kf, if you want this mobo get a 13600 not a k one ez",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you don't overclock the cpu don't buy 13600k, normal 13600 is perfect for this mobo.",and you can save some money,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so i should download the update on a usb drive and be ready as soon as i boot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
problem is i donâ€™t i am using a 9th gen cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in the cpu support list the i5-13600k is included as supported,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the crashes went away i take it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had the msi z690a pro ddr4 and it sucked ass for ddr4 memory oc.,sure my chips could be a turd.,"nonetheless, using a x16 connector by x1 is a joke, msi",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i know the z series are better for overclock but, i won't be overclocking anything thats why i am searching for something not too expensive",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is no non-k 13th gen cpus out yet >_<,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you may not need to, but god knows how long the one you get has been on a shelf.",it sounds like you may be uncomfortable with flashing.,u/ripard_a gave you a good roadmap here.,iâ€™d see if youâ€™re current before you make any changes.,you donâ€™t want to introduce variables before you encounter a problem.,"i was just saying that given itâ€™s age and the age of the update, just go ahead and have it ready.",odds are youâ€™ll need it.,you can download the manual from gigabyte.,read it before your build.,get the flash drive and os drives ready.,youâ€™ll want a current bios drive on hand anyway.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah yes, i think that's with the f20 bios update.",so your best bet may be to use the q-flash plus feature with a thumb drive on the motherboard before you start your build.,"it just comes down to whether you are using a new psu or your existing, as you just might have to do some rearranging if you do so.","i think for the q-flash plus process, only the power supply (24 mobo and cpu 8) needs to be installed on the new board, as it won't work if there's ram, cpu, or gpu i think.","once that's done, the board will have the f20a bios update, and then you can start your build.","the only other tips i can recall is you may have to adjust the csm support section in your bios for it to recognize an existing drive (if upgrading), and that when you are doing the front panel ports (depending on your case), that the white wires are the negatives and that they have little diagrams to put each cable in each subsection.",found that out the fun way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah it's all working good now.,i knew it was the psu as i used a second psu from another pc of mine to supplement a couple of the 8pin connectors on my gpu and doing that made the system stable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's why u should stick with the b660 mobos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the psu is kinda new i bought it 3 weeks ago a corsair sfx 750w,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sounds good.,i would just watch some q-flash plus youtube tutorials beforehand to see if you feel comfortable doing it and go from there.,the only other thing i can recall is the amount of motherboard/case screws needed.,"i upgraded from a 4690k, so i went from 6 mobo screws to 9 with this one, and i didn't have enough and the literature makes no mention of it.",so i had to buy more because i guess that's a case issue.,"if your existing mobo is 9 screws, then you should be fine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i watched a video on youtube on how to q-flash and the motherboard has the q-flash button and the usb slot from behind so i think it should be an easy process.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i'll reinstall the 12th gen that i had and see if it works, if not then i accidentally damaged the motherboard somehow.",if it's the socket would it have a fix?,or do i need a new motherboard?,i use 2 sticks on a2 & b2.,"slot a1 & a2 make it so that the pc won't boot after the new cpu install won't even go to bios, the power button stays blinking.",b1 & b2 boots to bios but as i said in the post after a few restarts it only reads 1 stick instead of both and it stayed that way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
will do so when i get a chance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'll have to check the other nvme slot just in case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"but in the bios the cpu info was displayed, would it still be badly seated if so?",i'll check the pins on the socket when i have chance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sorry, i had them like you said, in a2 & b2.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this could be an intel management engine outdated driver issue.,please see the link i posted to troubleshoot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if the socket is damaged it would be from bent pins which would be visible.,"non-updated me is known to cause memory issues, like non-functional xmp.","just fyi, using the wrong slots is pretty much guaranteed to not work.",a2 and b2 are correct.,"with that said, a single module should at least be detected in any one slot.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,"there are literally 1700 pins in the socket, relating to different features.","so, like a group of pins are responsible for a specific bank of memory.",another group will be responsible for the gpu slot.,another for the first m.2 slot.,still more for the dmi interface.,many redundant pins supply power.,"if whatâ€™s broken or not making contact is something thatâ€™s not critical for the cpu to function, only that can end up being non-functional.","like, one memory slot may not work (memory issues was a common symptom of a bad washer mod).",one m.2 slot may not work (but note that is also a well-known me issue).,perhaps the gpu can only negotiate to x4 and not x16.,"anyways, after youâ€™ve updated the management engine, thatâ€™s something to look at.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
enjoy!,i went from a 5900x to a 13900k and my god in terms of snapiness and gaming performance i am very happy with my upgrade.,0 problems as well.,will be happy to use this for at least 3-5 years,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
make sure you have a great cooler.,i canâ€™t avoid my 13700k being pegged at 100 on cinebench and other synthetic benchmarks.,"also, gaming iâ€™m between 70-85 degrees.",iâ€™m using a 280 ek aio.,obviously not going to cut it anymore.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah intel should go back to making motherboard the profits on those things are probably better than on chips themselves, and even better it requires no r&d.",it's a brain dead product to make.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm sick of reading comments saying why you upgraded and that their 6700ks are fine in gaming blah blah...

 i've gone from a 9700k to a 13700k and the results are remarkable.",both run with my 3080ti in 1440p and its night and day.,"bf2042 for example, 
9700k 3080ti 1440p really struggled and i dropped to 60fps at times.",i target 144 to monitors refresh.,no matter how much settings i changed i couldn't for the life of me get over 100fps.,the only way i could get frames i was happy with was 32v32 conquest but then still was 80s in fps.,"now the new one,

13700k with the 3080ti the game scanned my hardware and set everything to ultra.",i turned off motion blur and the usual shite i don't like.,i get between 120 to 180 frames depending on scenarios and the game is totally playable and most of all fun.,this just isn't the only game i've seen bumps in performance either but i'm using bf as an example as i know its a cpu intensive game.,all i'm saying is whoever says anything like 6700s are still great today they are not.,not at all especially in a time where high refresh rate and higher resolutions are mainstream.,if people want to upgrade upgrade.,you know what you want when you buy it and know what your looking for.,just sick of reading comments from people who haven't seen that jump themselves in front of their eyes talk people out of upgrading when the performance isn't marginal like they say its fucking miles apart.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i see this as an absolute win.,https://youtu.be/e-rnuhinyca,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why are you upgrading in such little steps?,i am still running a 6700k from 2015 at 4.9ghz and barely need to upgrade(for gaming anyway),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am on air with a 13600k and barely exceed 80c.,"i am using that thermalright bracket as shown by gamers nexus, it was cheap and easy to mount (even though this was my first build involving cpu installation).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've got an arctic freezer 2 280mm aio coming in for my 13700k hopefully that can handle it.,i saw a youtube video were only the 280mm and their 420mm could keep the 12900k from throttling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got cooler master illusion 360ml,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a corsair 240mm h100icue on my 13700k.,in a phanteks 500a case all kitted with noctua fans.,3 140mm at from 140mm at back and 2 noctua 120mm on the rad top mounted.,29c idle gaming between 50 and 75.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"for some it's for more practical reasons, like profit/production efficiency related.",but also a lot simply because people just can't help it.,"aka ""upgrade fever"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had problems with amd/ my 5900x and it was starting to really piss me off.,i had a 6700k but upgraded to a 5900x.,"i would get stutters in games, performance issues, pbo has been broken by amd for over a year with no fix.","chipset drivers and bios updates giving a regression in performance, also windows updates completely fucking ryzen users with 2ccds.",i could go on but iâ€™ll just leave it as saying the i9 was worth the upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it is as thought he's balling in the first half of the post then he drops the bomb saying he's gonna keep it for the next 3 to 5 years, implying he doesn't actually print money in his backyard lol...


it's his money anyway, more power to him.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's crazy.,are you undervolted?,i couldn't keep my idle temps under 40. i'm in o11d mini with 11 fans.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my app isn't showing the reply to my comment.,as to my knowledge no i'm not udervolted.,i bought my bundle from scan uk and they stress tested the system before shipping.,my notcua fans have helped loads tho as the fans were ramped right up to keep the temps down so when i replaced them i have the two on rad running constant 1300rpm and the 4 140mm running no more than 1000rpm as that was the sweet spot for me and it being silent.,my coolant temps are always lower than my cpu core temp which is always a good sign too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can as long as you get the master key.,contact b&h support for it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i mean a log of people buy designer clothes and that sort of shit, i just like to upgrade my pc whenever i can",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good to know thanks.,was considering amd but always thought intel was more stable and reliable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i replied to your comment.,erm maybe 11 fans could be your issue maybe you have negative air within your case and its trapped making your temps warmer?.,there is videos and stuff on the net on how to create a good airflow.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"okay i will, thx",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is the support response: it looks like we're not offering it from our side.,i would suggest to contact intel for assistance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i donâ€™t think itâ€™s that.,"with the 12700k, i idled at 27-28 degrees and gaming did not go past 62-64. same gpu with both scenarios too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at 4k it won't make much of a difference in gaming between the 13600k and the 13700k especially at a 120hz cap.,a lot of the difference is the i5's lower binned clocks which you can overcome by throwing more voltage at it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you'll see a small advantage with the i7-13700k if you're actually cpu bottlenecked, which will be virtually never.",i'd go with the i5 and call it a day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
go for 13600k.,heck even 12700k/12600k if you want to save more money.,you will hardly notice the difference in game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"can afford 13700k, get the 13700k, simple as that.",especially with 4090 sticking to 13600k is silly.,"~10% over 13600k, when gpu is not getting raped.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"cheers, thanks for the answer!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if it makes you feel any better i'm still getting that as well.,"in my case intel has asked for proof of purchase, but has gone full on ghost mode for the last 2 days.. hopefully you have better luck.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™m in the same boat, shown proof several times from my purchase and theyâ€™ve gone silent now",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so i was getting this same error too and decided to reach out to support about it.,"thankfully, they responded rather quickly and helped me redeem the code.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean you bought intel.,it comes with the disappointment bundle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also still getting an error has occurred.,i hope they fix it and we all will be able to play,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same thing for me also,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"same, only ref.",004 code.,"i have been asked for proof of purchase and code 4 times, and still no one can even tell what's going, not to mention fix it.","personally, this is by far the worst promo redemption i have ever had.","i mean, intel is not even beign transparent and giving any kind of guidance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yup, i also contacted the support and they did the same thing as you mentioned.",i sent over the receipt and then the support just ghost me.,the way they want to hide the fact that they don't have enough codes for redemption is so lame.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i opened 3 tickets, all the same as you described.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you are lucky, so they just sent you the code?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
make sense,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they will fix it once they have the codes, lol.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm in the same position as you two :(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no they just cleared the error from their end and i was able to redeem instantly.,i had â€œref-002â€ error.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"good to know, seems like the issue will not automatically go away.",it has to have support involved.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"unify-x at work, doing its thing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not impressive with evga dark doing near 9000. it's z690 4 dimm boards that are a question mark,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"while it is still nice, a 7200 cl34 working on a 2-slot motherboard with a 13th-gen really isn't much of a surprise.",they are known to go close to 9000. this really shouldn't be a challenge at all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm going to test the 7000 version - cmt32gx5m2x7000c34 - on my 4-dimm z690 taichi at the weekend.,wish me luck,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this is xmp, iâ€™ve tested 7600 and it works.",going to try 8000 next.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with 13th gen it's easy 7400 mhz on any board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah i was wondering if it was 12th gen initially and how much voltage he was running through the imc :)  


that's still a nice oc - xmp run op.",keep it up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would expect for it to fail.,if you were using a 13900k there is a chance it would succeed.,but a 4 dimm board with a 12900k is very unlikely to boot 7000.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it boots.,gamed on it but have far from fully tested it yet.,"aida64 (old version..) [https://imgur.com/a/tbybjjp](https://imgur.com/a/tbybjjp) 

the high latency seems to just be a trait of my 4-dimm board.",my old samsung 6000 36-36-36 kit got 66.3ns at xmp on my last saved test.,tuning the timings could get my latency down a bit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i've had the 13700k for a few days now and so far been extremely happy with it.,i'm using an arctic liquid freezer ii 280mm aio.,at stock in cinebench r23 the temps went up to about 92-93 and at least on my setup that caused throttling and the p-cores went to around 5.1ghz.,i then did a -100mv offset in bios.,everything was stable and temps started going down.,"i put a -150mv offset and everything is still stable, but it seems the adaptive mode provides the voltage necessary, so without forcing the voltage, the offset alone stops making a difference somewhere around -100mv on my chip.",my core voltages are at about 1.28 (stock was about 1.375) when running cinebench.,max load temps stabilize at 86-87c after 10-20min.,"there's no throttling and my cbr23 score is consistently about 30500.

"no, was either playing far cry 5 or fc new dawn ultra everything on a 450w 4090 @4k.",could have been a crappy mb i had originally for all i know.,i did do the suggested power limits in the bios (mine were auto - 4025w ?tf?).,also noticed the fan curves were pretty bad.,also did the undervolt of 150mv.,temps plummeted into mid 70s with 3d mark time spy extreme stress test.,prime95 almost instantly pegged to 100 so i'm not messing with that further.,-- so far no whea errors but will game tomorrow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i finished my build and had two devices missing drivers, drove me nuts trying to figure it out since i had installed the driver listed.","however, i didn't realize there was more drivers available as asus doesn't show them by default.",i had to furiously google to come to this conclusion :d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is nothing new.,it's the same for all their motherboards.,it threw me off when i was trying to download drivers for an h87 chipset year or so ago.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can always use armoury crate and install all the driver's from there.,afterwards uninstall that crap.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is why i always use the usb stick for drivers.,"they might not be the most up to date, but you get blanket coverage for everything.","then i go to their site and downloaded any that might be a newer version

also, i hate asus as they seemingly drop major driver support 6 months after release.",my 2020 mobo got a single bios and audio driver so far this year.,"when in reality, intel has released tons of driver updates alone this year for their components.",iâ€™d honestly switch to another brand if they promised like 4 years of driver support.,lenovo has been providing timely driver updates for my 4 year old work laptop.,keeps it secure and compatible with the latest versions of windows,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
had the same problem!,"found out the hard way, after few hours of thinking and googling, there is a way to fix missing devices is to download asus armoury crate, but it installs so much crap like sonar audio that i donâ€™t really need and is very hard to uninstall after so yeah!",update drives manually!,everything you need from armory is already in the bios.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you have a lot of silent installs as well?,running the setup brings up the uac prompt and then nothing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you download certain drivers directly from the oems?,"for example, intel / amd for chipset / lan / wifi / bt etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i've always used asus boards but it's been a few years from me, so i must have forgotten.",i just figured maybe someone else might find it useful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i hate that armoury crate prompts to install itself from the bios.,that always seems like shady malware behavior.,and they should localize the strings so itâ€™s armory crate for en-us.,/s,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did install and uninstall that pos.,i liked the fan control interface though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is armoury crate that bad?,i use it for fan control and driver updating.,is there anything else that's used for fan control now?,i remember speedfan being a thing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i currently have armory crate installed.,it's insane how much that app has running.,wouldn't bug me if that crap just always ran on the e cores but i don't think the scheduler is that sophisticated yet.,the fan app is great what do you use in it's place?,lately i prefer gaming to tinkering with settings but eventually i'll get around to it and uninstall armory crate.,i guess you can do everything in the bios ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, i don't think i will do that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"asus doesnt provide usb stick for strix and below, i may be wrong about this.",i was expecting one since the very slightly inferior msi mpg z790 carbon does have it while my strix-e doesnt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, i did have a few of those too.",i just kept device manager open the whole time to check.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i used to but now i just use whatever the mobo maker has on its site.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ll usually download the intel drivers from their website.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the last time i willing purchased an asus motherboard was the a7n8x deluxe back in 2002 or 2003. i bought a used asus motherboard back in 2013 or so for an fx-8350 which was complete garbage, trashed the board and swapped over to a gigabyte motherboard which was night & day difference.","there are just some companies i stay clear from, western digital being another.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this software is brilliant.,"https://github.com/rem0o/fancontrol.releases
to see the advantages of it watch this video.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udpkvkbmqu8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in theory it should run on ecore only since it is a background task once minimized.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have the tuf z790 and you can set the fan curves in the bios.,"but i just set it to ""standard"" in armory crate and it's whisper quiet until there's a load on the cpu and it ramps them up a bit.","it's amazing that it's in totally silent mode when i'm gaming, can't even tell if my pc is on or not.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ve found that the mobo makers donâ€™t have the latest versions posted on their download pages.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the fx era asus board were bad.,the bios couldnâ€™t boot from gpt on a non windows os unless it was supported by secure boot.,they never fixed that and i had to reinstall my os with mbr partitions as a result.,also had crappy sata ports that would fail over time.,"that said i had good luck with several of their newer motherboard including the asus prime x370, prime z590 and asus tuf b450.",the b350 tuf boards are crap though.,had 2 fail,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"only useful for fans plugged until the mobo fan headers though, right?",i tried it but it didn't detect and can't talk to usb-connected fan hubs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks, i'll have a look.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
meh.,i'm still not a big fan of asus.,i built some 15+ systems for the office using their asus prime h570-plus boards and not impressed.,we were 100% gigabyte for the past 10+ years here.,"i wish i didn't make the switch, but it is what it is.",all future builds will be gigabyte though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah sorry, i have only used it with mobo headers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
try running a stress test of some sort intel burn test or something else cinnbench can sometimes not crash on otherwise unstable systems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
too high undervolt.,"you can check if you're not overdoing it by launching hwinfo and checking effective clock, also make sure to have 100 ms polling period so you can see fluctuations clearly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this sounds similar to the problems other users of 13th gen intel users have been reporting on 600 series motherboards with old versions of the intel management engine installed.,try making sure that this is updated to the latest version first.,"you can also check event viewer to see if it is picking up signs of cpu instability, it's certainly possible this is an unstable undervolt though i agree i would normally expect different symptoms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"12th gen launched very shortly after 11th gen, and people (along with intel) didnt care about it so much.","maybe other reasons too, like too much heat, as 11th gen was pretty bad efficiency wise.",intel already confirmed a 13900ks that should be able to do 6ghz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there will be a 13900ks, intelâ€™s already announced it.",they didnâ€™t make an 11900ks because the 11900k was already the worst intel cpu released in at least ten years.,they wouldâ€™ve been torn to shreds if they tried to make a factory-overclocked version of it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cuz 11th gen sucked.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks all!,i was thinking about dropping in a 11900k to give myself pcie 4 and figured maybe a 5-7% perf increase in compute/games.,"after watching two gamers nexus videos, it turns out the 11900k is 5-10% slower in compute tasks.","then in a second video, even a 4090 only sees still 1-3% perf increase in gen 4 over gen 3 at 4k.",so it would be stupid to upgrade.,"iâ€™d need to go all the way to probably 13900k, and even then at 4k, i probably wouldnâ€™t see a huge increase.",going to save my time and money and just wait probably till 14900k(s).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the actual reason is because the 11900k was already an 11700ks.,there was no difference between 11700k and 11900k except for the binning.,"but also yeah, the generation was extremely short.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is no 11th gen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11th gen was overall performance regression.,13900ks will probably announced sometime next year.,intel already hint at 6ghz rpl.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it wasnâ€™t that bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i always appreciate your knowledge.,i reviewed gn review of the 11900k from a year ago and itâ€™s a step back from the 10900k (what i currently have) in every way except you get gen 4 support.,"but gn just came out with another video that shows even on a 4090 at 4k, you only see 1-3% improvement with gen 4 vs gen 3.

so iâ€™m keeping my 10900k for another cycle.",might go for a 14900k or preferably a 14900ks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it absolutely was.,"the 12600k murdered it for half the price just eight months after launch, and even at launch it was basically a much less efficient 5800x for $100 more, and the 5800x was a bad chip already.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
figured i'd upgrade my 12700k and stick with ddr4 and i'm very happy with the results.,"2/6.0 4/5.9 8/5.8, hitting around 1.25v under load in cinebench.",single core is around 2350.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah i've just seen a few people saying that the 13700k isn't worth it with ddr4 and i don't really get that.,"for about a $100 upgrade once i sell my 12700k, this has been absolutely worth it.",cheap msi z690 pro a motherboard and a $130 32gb ram kit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thats based on a noobtuber review that tried to compare ddr4 to ddr5 on 13600k and 13900k.,except he configured the ddr4 to 4000cl14 in gear2!!!,"so add to those results what it might have been in gear 1, or how much better a kit like mine is in 4800+ gear 2.",13900ks and 5000+cl18 gogogogo soon!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

part of the reason i think it's slower is because of the crowdstrike monitoring and security software.",seems like it's always bogging it down and using multiple cores.,"i think it's the primary reason i never see high turbo speeds because anytime there's file io or an app is launched, it's scarfing down a few cores to check everything.","so i never realize the turbo benefits because all activities become a multi-core operation, usually to the tune of 40% consumed just by crowdstrike.","on the desktop i have all security stuff disabled such as scanners, realtime protection, speculative execution, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

cinebench isnâ€™t the greatest at weeding out anything but the most severe instabilityâ€¦ prime95 is generally a lot faster at this.,but it will also catch the kind of instability thatâ€™s unlikely to ever occur during normal use.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if you can find a 9900k cheap enough it can be worth it.,but depending on your current cooler also factor in getting something decent for it.,otherwise i'd suggest thinking about a 12400/f and motherboard or 13600k and motherboard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
get a b660 mb and a 13600kf and use your same ram.,should be about 420-440ish but you'll get 4x-5x the  multi core performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

meteor lake having both a 6+8 *and* a 6+16 option?,"given that we've already seen the 6+8 chip many times, it means we'd need a second compute chip to be designed and manufactured with the extra e cores, along with a whole new package design in general since it will be a bit larger.",that seems hugely wasteful.,i'm expecting meteor lake to just be the one option that we've been seeing - 6p+8e.,"i dont think meteor lake will be that exciting from a consumer point of view, honestly.",seems like it's gonna be a bit of a pipe cleaner demonstration for their chiplet technology and new intel 4 process.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't take it too seriously.,that leak might be wrong.,i expect about 26% higher performance from meteor lake and the same prices.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wccftech is not a reliable source.,let us see what raichu is saying on this.,he did say mtc/arl are both 14th gen and arl will be for desktop.,i think we will hopefully know greater details in next analyst day or intel on event now that rpl is done.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is.. odd.,125w tdp (half the power of current gen?,"), and fewer cores despite the more advanced packaging?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

unless they improve the scheduler by a lot i don't think how can this work.,games for example only use the p cores.,having only 6 pcores in the high-end products looks like a disaster for every tasks for which the e cores are not helpful.,maybe what intel is trying to do is pushing the gamers into a much expensive future hedt platform with cpus with 8+ pcores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
meteor lake is going to be a monster.,can't wait.,"i hang out in a channel on efnet with many of the asus, gigabyte, asrock, msi, even some old abit guys and all of them have early samples of the motherboards and meteror lake cpu's.","they are all in their 40's and 50's and 60's so no, they are not leaking anything but some of them have said it's going to be a ""big big deal"" and i believe it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
quad xe doesn't sound too exciting when xe max was pointless and xe2 battlemage is still nowhere to be seen.,intel needs to put raytracing igpus on its roadmap.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why less p cores... hmmm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is this the so called raptor lake being renamed or the one following after it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and games only uses 1 core..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if die space is at a premium, it could be a good balance.","this is a *client* sku, not a workstation.","you want lots of p cores, get fishhawk falls or threadripper.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
e-cores really shine in this because there are a lot of them and they're clocked lower.,p-core perf/w i think has been incrementally better with each 10nm architecture but it's the e-cores that really push the mt gains lately.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel uses multiple compute dies each generation.,"the 9100, 9400f, and 9900k all used different dies.",alder lake has 2 desktop (6+0 and 8+8) and 2 laptop dies (6+8 and 2+8) too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i can't imagine a way that meteor lake is cheap for intel to produce.,it's a question of how low intel is willing to cut their margins on a 1st iteration product with unique packaging and soc architecture and an all new process node.,"if intel can make enough of them, the performance and especially efficiency should be more competitive than any time in the last 3 years or so.","so my bet is on ""high msrp.""",btw intel announced already that they're raising prices next year even for *existing* parts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i doubt prices will be the same.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">i expect about 26% higher performance from meteor lake

not surprising since it only replaces the i3/i5 cpu's and 13th gen still uses adler lake die for them(aside from 13600k/kf)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's not directly from wccf though.,someone posted some slides on twitter but then they were deleted soon after afaik.,we don't know about authenticity of those docs however,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

for intel tdp = pl1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lmao raptor lake s is also 125w tdp.,and intel doesn't use chiplets to increase core count.,mtl cpu tile having fewer cores isn't surprising cause it's using a new node.,i think some leaks were also saying arl-s is manufactured on tsmc n3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i very much feel this is wrong.,"this would most likely make the i5 have 4 p cores and that's something i really really doubt would happen, unless they somehow have 40-50% per core uplift over 13th gen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
arl-s 8+16 is allegedly also 14th gen so mtl is not flagship,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes.,"that's been strongly suggested for a while now, even if people here dont want to accept it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that would only be a problem if the p-cores and e-cores are exactly the same, which i doubt.","for example, if 14th gen e-cores are as fast as 10th gen comet lake, are we really going to complain?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe they better cores,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why would they do that?,they would hand the market to amd.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6p cores is more than enough for any game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it's a desktop cpu, there is no need for more.",amds ryzen 7000 desktop igpu are even smaller than adl/rpt with 2 xe cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mostly likely.,should be a new socket.,2 gens per socket?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the euv should make things simpler in many ways.,the long delays until now have been in part due to intel not using euv and attempting various workarounds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think you are underestimating people working at intel.,they are able to keep prices rising with inflation and not more than that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13th gen does not use alder lake dies.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then it could be right.,no screenshots were captured?,i dont see any in wccftech article.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sometimes roadmaps change.,that's a big reason they're internal documents in the first place.,"a lot of these sources have just bits of information like ""hey i saw these real references to this thing from a year ago"" but they don't have any knowledge of how far along it is or if it's still slated to come to market.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nope, usually it's someone with at least some kind of track record or if not then they at least publish the roadmap image or something.","but here they don't say from who or where they got it, whether it was one of their readers or something else etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel hasn't used a brand new process node to replace all client products across the board in one generation since... i don't know, before broadwell.",basically forever.,i'm surprised these are coming to desktop at all in the first gen since mobile seems a better fit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes.,however most games these days are in the all-core frequency.,you have to find some really old game to find them running a singular thread these days.,"so, you will have to oc the all-core sector, which is a lot more difficult since it draws upward of 300w for most chips in order to get that high up (going from 5.1 to 5.5 ).",that part entirely depends on your silicon lottery luck.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

13700k here.,didnâ€™t bother with stock ilm as i read it bends the socket over time and gamersnexus showed the awful contact.,i run it with a noctua nh-d15 (2 fans on cooler) and idle around 30c and while gaming never really go above 60-65c in fractal compact with fans around 650-750rpm.,i donâ€™t know if this helps at all.,figured iâ€™d share my temps though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think that might explain the memory boot failures with some of the frames.,my cheukchi frame does not compress the leaf springs enough to press the cpu to full seating depth.,"using a 0.6n-m torque driver on the coldplate clamp definitely seated the cpu pcb deeper into the socket, although i'm not sure if it bottomed out or not.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the ihs is concave?,as in the ihs outer area is taller than the center or convex as in the ihs center is taller than the outer area?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't stress it.,i've reinstalled mine 3 times now because of some upgrades and what not.,it's not as hard or surgical as people make it out to be.,just drop all 4 screws in and spin them in the opposite direction until you hear the threads set.,then just give each one a quarter or half turn alternating between them obviously until they're snug.,never had any boot or memory issues.,totally worth it.,those no post or memory issues you're seeing are mostly from people over tightening the thing.,that's the worst case scenario and to fix that all you have to do is just loosen up the screws a bit and it fixes the issues.,just make sure they're snug that's all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very carefully.,"i used the technique shown in the video i linked, where you wind back until you get a very noticeable drop.","then do 1/4 turns until you feel slight resistance, then small adjustments until you feel hard resistance, then stop.","no post issues, i did have to boot in to bios as it thought there was a new processor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

fair point.,they could improve the current ilm so that it doesnâ€™t just push down on two small parts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

8700k was the first chip that people started delidding and derbauer made a delid tool.,mine reached tjmaxx at stock speed and was refunded by intel because i wasn't going to risk a delid.,they used toothpaste instead of solder for the first time or some such.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's just people being lazy, not checking their work and giving the screws a once over.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s interesting i wasnâ€™t even aware they used faulty solder.,i knew that people were having issues with the copper ihs.,some people were hitting 100c.,i guess i got lucky because i never de-lidded and never had issues with temperatures.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you think i should use the stock ilm to prove the cpu is fine before i replace it with the contact frame?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no the solder wasn't faulty.,they didn't have solder.,they had some god knows how cheap thermal paste that was the equivalent of toothpaste.,mine hit 95c in under a minute at stock.,"intel support asked me run loads of tests and then offered a refund as they didn't have any replacement chips, so i bought a 9700k after.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you already have the frame just use it.,at worst it doesn't change anything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s awful.,i wonder why my experience is so much different than yours.,i bought my chip in august of 2017 and iâ€™ve never seen my chip get above 80c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

my gpu runs at 70-75 while gaming but the hotspot ranges from 85-90 that's what concerns me.,in all cases gpu temps/hotspot temps get lowered by 6 degrees without the case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
he means unscrewing it and taking it off.,not cutting it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
those temps are fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

gaming workloads are usually light so you can push crazy clocks even on air.,production benchmarks tend to push the power consumption at high clocks so it's likely that power goes too high for your nh-d15 to handle and the chip throttles.,with water cooling you could likely push high clocks even in production benchmarks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

are you using pure vcore or are you using an offset?,i switched to an offset and it dropped my temps massively and allowed me to push my cpu further.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,100% stable.,"no, only 3 of the cores manage to go to 6ghz.",i run ai overclock on my asus motherboard and that's what it runs.,i didn't have to tweak anything or do any manual settings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hey i know itâ€™s been about a month but i havenâ€™t messed with my 13600k yet.,iâ€™m speaking from experience with previous intel cpus.,just look up how to use a voltage offset and you should be able to figure things out.,iâ€™d be appreciative if you could confirm that it does in fact reduce temperatures afterwards because that may not be the case with all motherboards and cpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

have you considered the 13700k as a middle ground?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it depends on the price.,be aware that the 13700k is still faster than the 12900k so that's also an option you should consider,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

how much more is the 13900k?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"
the 13900k is a lot faster than the 12900ks.","the 13700k is as fast or faster than the 12900ks, so unless the 12900ks is cheaper than the 13700k, go for the latter.","unless you have a 12th gen cpu available, the prime z690-a is a bad choice for 13th gen as it lacks bios flashback, and youâ€™ll need either that or a 12th gen cpu before 13th gen will work in a z690 board.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not the 12900ks.,it's way overpriced and obsolete compared to the 13900k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this post reads as a troll post looking for upvotes.,given no stated budget and then later adds 4-5k is suspicious to say the least.,4-5k usd is enough to basically buy all top tier components.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13700k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13900k for sure.,you might want a better motherboard (better vrm components) if you plan to tweak the voltage settings for lower temps.,msi unify-x z690.,(ddr5),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm assuming this is >2-3k build, for that kind of money why would you go for a dead platform?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if money isn't an issue than a 13900k obviously.,either that or a 13700k.,12900k doesn't make sense anymore.,13700k is faster all around while being cheaper.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there are clues that a 13th gen intel could be 25% slower on z690 than on a z790...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
only reason why cause my budget was 4-5k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no not really,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my mother board is a prime z690-a will it still work or be fast,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13900k it depends on some stores like amazon is selling it for 700 and bh is selling it for 670,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4-5k i forgot to put my budget in plus iâ€™m a first time builder,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just no.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then just get the 13900k?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
edit: i checked your prior posts.,thatâ€™s a hell of a budget.,looks like youâ€™re going to use this for 4k gaming and editing right?,you mentioned coding too but i donâ€™t know if thatâ€™s going to be resource intensive.,"anyways, with that budget, swing for the fence.",13900k and top of the line gpu.,4090 or you can wait for amds offerings coming out.,"tbh, iâ€™d probably wait to get a 4090 in store or online somewhere not from a scalper.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
~~if you don't care about the budget get a 7950x and replace it with 7950x3d when it  arrives.~~ otherwise if 12900ks performance is fine for you just get a 13700k as it's more performant and priced well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
one thing to consider is if you're okay with loud noise.,to keep an i9 13900k cool under full load you're going to need liquid cooling with the fans running at full speed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if your budget's that big, there's no reason to compromise.",get the 13900k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it should be better than the 12900k in pretty much everything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
watch some benchmarks and decide if it's worth the price difference.,personally i wouldn't pay 200$ more for the 13900k if it isn't atleast 20% faster,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"13th gen is on a dead platform, if you're okay with that/builds new pcs every 4-5 years, then no issues.","with the 7950x you have a pretty decent upgrade path, not nearly as long as am4 but decent nonetheless.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ok thank you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes and that was an issue with an outdated me firmware.,it was required to be updated for 13th gen which resolved the issue.,"so again, just no.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your motherboard won't hold back the cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i completely agree with you.,it's my way to subtly suggest amd in the intel subreddit.,i also think 7950x > 13900k unlike uncompetitive amd parts down the stack.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that should be sufficient, just keep in mind if you want to avoid it throttling too much under full loads the radiator fans will likely need to run at 100%.",there isn't really any cooler on the market that can cool the 13900k at full load without either being loud or throttling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"got it lol

79xx is brilliant, for someone who is building a brand new multiple-thousand dollar build, it makes zero sense to go with 13th gen. i've seen some people suggest the lower platform costs associated with going with 690 series and 13th gen with a bios update, but then for someone is spending like 3-4k on a build, what's a couple hundred more to get a longer platform :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it won't mess up your build.,if it gets to 100c it will just thermal throttle by 5-10%.,you won't really notice it.,the cpu is designed to run up to 115c before it shuts down.,if you're super concerned about temps you can just cap the power limit in bios and it will run nice and cool and still perform well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13700k would have more performance and be easier to cool.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in here cheapest i9 12900ks is 777â‚¬ and cheapest 13900k 755â‚¬ ðÿ˜­ it's insane how cpu costs 3/4 of the price of my pc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do we know how many encoding streams are available?,is there a limit on arc gpus ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nope.,there's no concurrent sessions limit on intel gpu.,it will work until the vram runs out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

noice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
absolutely.,extreme is on the way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is 13th gen cpu better at memory oc?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pretty much smashes 12th gen with memory support.,"never before seen gains, that are transmittable even for z690.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i am getting some hynix a-die but haven't got my cpu yet, are there any differences in memory oc between 13700k and 13900k?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so z690 and 13th gen can hit high speeds?,so like both z790 and z690 can hit around the same numbers provided the cpu has a strong imc like a 13700k?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
does z790 offer any advantages for ram stability over z690?,my understanding was no.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"silicon lottery, as always.",pure rng.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13700 has better lattency in memory oc.,actually the best.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, people sporting regular z690 boards with raptor are already smashing unify-x and apex scores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"luumi said z690 dark and z790 dark are functionally the same, i don't yet have more data about how much better z790 is over z690, as most people that overclock ram just jump into z790 anyway.",those using z690 still break 7000 mhz easily on 4 dimm.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
alright.,i guess i will just stick with a 13700k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would that extend to a lesser extent on 4 dimm daisy chain boards if running only 2x16gb?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes it does extend.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there's no stock cooler with a 13600k and even if there was, the cpu height is off by 1mm so you'll have a hard time fitting the lga1700 onto the old socket.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"on paper, they are not backwards compatible.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"like people said, nope.","if not stated as compatible, assume it isn't.","but a $25 cooler is enough for a 10400f, don't worry about it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i really like this card.,it's surprisingly good.,nice to see the community coming up with ideas to work around some of the issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this has been posted several times now.,"it's good info, but we really need to get hardware unboxed testing a dozen games on dxvk.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tldw these cards are trash and they run old games like trash without some kind of trashy emulation or whatever it is.,"forget about running crysis, the new metric is 'can it run worms?'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the miniature looks a bit click bait,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why hardware unboxed?,are they the authority on gaming performance?,"if so, why?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"eh, i think that the testing methodologies of hub have been suspect lately

i'm going to hold off on watching them until they get their shit together",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"dxvk is not ""trashy emulation"", it's a directx to vulkan translation layer that's used in many places",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i find they do the best gaming tests, and they usually include a ton of games, and a number of comparison cards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah best is digital foundry.,they have no clickbait and are really subjective.,really good reviews by those guys and they show their work.,each and every benchmark can be reviewed on youtube.,the entire runs.,with fps avgs and lows/highs.,hub is very bad.,just a bunch of bars on the screen with no really good reason.,no back checking.,a ton of gpu bottleneck tests for cpu reviews.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i generally trust hub and i believe they dont try to show wrong numbers but indeed lately something in their systems have made a difference compared to others,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
'in many places'.,you mean linux and now this.,"imagine not being backwards compatible with anything up to dx11 and making excuses that this is somehow ok. 

its not ok.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they are just bad normies.,their tests are not that good really.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is their cpu-focused bottleneck game?,e.g.,"cs:go, valorant",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why is it not okay?,"dx9 and dx11 are legacy apis, just implementing vulkan and offering these apis via dxvk is a significantly better use of resources than developing a standalone driver for them.",not sure why intel isn't doing it tbh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"while you're not wrong you're making yourself look foolish by not knowing what a translation layer is and calling it ""trashy emulation""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if the perf is there, then it's ok. there's nothing inherently wrong with translation layers.",your os is filled with them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""bad normies"" lol.","what are you, 12?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"what is ""not that good"" in their tests?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dxvk is irrelevant for esport titles because of anticheats,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"csgo has vulkan native client though, at least on linux",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, new dx11 games are still coming out, even in 2022",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because no one with a real actually functional gpu needs to even care about this crap.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sorry but thatâ€™s irrelevant.,you just test all with anti cheat on to make it a fair comparison.,thereâ€™s still a customer who wants the absolute best esports gaming performance.,and i admit better hw doesnâ€™t make you the best gamer.,"still important to add, and they donâ€™t have it in their test suite lmao.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's not native vulkan, just a wrapper over opengl",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, but the number is steadily decreasing, and the performance impact of dxvk is below 5%.","also, new dx11 games tend to be on the lower demanding half (i.e.",not aaa games),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you are being rather rude about it but youâ€™re exactly right, this intel performance is even more embarrassing than 4090s blowing up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sorry, my bad, but, nonetheless, performance is better by miles (in my case, went from sub 100 to over 140)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
of course!,"vulkan supremacy

this comment is so blindingly incorrect i had to put sunglasses on.,"13th gen is a massive performance improvement, to the point that intel has been showing off the fact that 13900k @ 65 watts can equal the performance of the 12900k at 250 watts.","clearly that is not because intel raised the thermal limits :)

our problem isn't solved at all if the trend continues upward.,your line of thinking is exactly how we deal with servers and other data center equipment.,it's okay if raw energy use is going up a bit if performance is increasing 2-3x every couple years because doing more with fewer servers in a data center is an overall energy win.,it helps that the servers are more utilized than most desktops on average.,desktop sales alone in the us in a given year are anywhere from 7-10x the volume of server shipments.,the smaller increases in power with larger performance gains in the server space are flopped in the desktop market right now where smaller performance gains (compared to servers) are coming at much larger chunks of additional energy as configured by the oems.,"yes die shrinks cut energy, moore's law isn't dead yet *clap clap* but the % of energy increase on the consumer side is alarming, and it's actually arguably worse on the discrete gpu side.","the base architecture is always improving, which is why the mobile versions of these chips have gotten so solid in general we barely have anything left to do there.","but the desktop side where the are no battery life considerations we still see all kinds of wild shit, even from plenty of oem systems where power draw is ramping up beyond the needs of average users to win marketing wars.","no most people aren't going to go buy the latest 600w gpu, but it drags up the power of even the low end stuff to 200-300w, far higher than just a couple gens before.",yes it brings far more performance too!,but if desktops en masse start drawing nearly 500-1kw of power to support that performance then we a real power problem at a national scale.,"we're not after enthusiasts, the number of us are relatively small and many of us build our own rigs anyway.","but if the average mid-high end oem desktop configs start really creeping *up* in power rather than staying pretty steady or even declining like they have nearly every gen to gen the past 20 years, you have a regulatory nightmare that can't be explained away like we do on the server side (the principle that 2 powerful servers can do more overall work and use less overall energy than 6 weaker ones doesn't fly with individual desktops).",everything we do is data driven by both power and performance data with the manufacturers hand in hand and it's not a guessing game.,but the power trend going up at the rate it is in this volume regardless or the performance benefits raises a lot of red flags in the environmental policy world whether you all like it or not frankly.,that's the reality.,"it's not always about the tech, but how it's marketed, configured when shipped, and used by the average user at a national level.","we don't just look at the market now, but also 2-4 years out, and we have access to oem info to help us navigate that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you can see that the gigabyte intel me fw is a higher version (16.1.25.1917) than even the one included in the asus package (16.1.25.1885).","edit:

you can also use this tool from intel to see what version your intel me firmware is (in addition to checking if its vulnerable): https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/19392/intel-converged-security-and-management-engine-version-detection-tool-intel-csmevdt.html",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">â£400 for a z690i gaming wi-fi itx motherboard and it becomes inoperable due to outdated me firmware

you probably bought a really old z690 with old firmware.",from my understanding the latest models of the same motherboard get newer firmware from the factory itself right?.,(or should atleast),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sorry, iâ€™m not familiar with msi boards.",but people have responded in this thread that msi doesnâ€™t have the same intel management engine out of date drivers that asus boards have.,create a post in the intel reddit thread requesting assistance; iâ€™m sure youâ€™re not the only one w/this issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i asked a few friends with gigabyte z690 boards and they didnâ€™t have any issues whatsoever.,i personally bought an msi one and itâ€™s safe to say the new me firmware is indeed bundled within the bios update,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"looking at aschilling's tweet, apparently a z790 bios update was bundled with the wrong me firmware (whoops)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you should be able to disable the igpu in bios.,"in fact, most people have the opposite issue - getting both to work at once.",but hereâ€™s the thing - as you sure your igpu is actually active and is the issue?,the error you show could be the driver package not seeing an igpu to install drivers for.,does it show up in device manager?,what is your gpu?,if itâ€™s 9 years old it may also be an issue .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nope.,"if you have a faster gpu that is supported in adobe, then the intel gpu is a non-issue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"both are detected in device manager yeah and iâ€™ve tried disabling my integrated graphics again and again, the programs run the same.",i have an amd radeon rx 6600 xt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is it fine to uninstall the integrated graphics card's drivers if one has a vastly better discrete gpu anyway?,"the display is through the discrete gpu and the lot, so no issues there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, that gpu shouldnâ€™t be an issue!",what is the actual error that adobe is giving you?,and you could try disabling the igpu from device manager.,"or, take a photo of your bios settings as relates to the igpu and letâ€™s see if we can figure it out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you can if you want, but i wouldnâ€™t bother.",no harm in having it around as a backup.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[photo of bios settings](https://imgur.com/a/gpbdroo)

â€˜unsupported video driverâ€™ is the error.","incidentally, i disabled intel processor graphics, because i assumed youâ€™d advise me to and the errorâ€™s gone.",but the program doesnâ€™t run any better.,:(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i ask, because adobe insists on trying to use the integrated graphics, even when i've disabled it in device manager.","i figure if i uninstall the drivers entirely, there's nothing for adobe to cling to and it'll be forced to use the discrete gpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what kind of issues in adobe are you seeing?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s very odd.,"you can try uninstalling the intel gpu drivers, probably no harm in that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lag.,simply strong lag.,"and to be clear, this problem primarily occurred when i jumped from the 2019 version to 2022. iâ€™m pretty sure all my settings are correct, i use proxy files, all of that jazz.","i think my ram is good enough, i have 24 gigs and it never peaks in task manager.","my c drive isnâ€™t very good for space, but i think itâ€™s good enough for this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so, video editing.","just a few questions/observations:

- ssd or hard disk?",- what kind of video files are you editing?,"source capture device, resolution, framerate, color depth?","- i note 24gb of memory, which implies either 3x8 or 2x4 and 2x8.",so all of it might not be in dual channel mode.,"- when itâ€™s lagging, does task manager show high cpu or gpu or storage or memory usage?","- unfortunately, adobe may have started using more modern decoding/features and perhaps dropped support for older hardware.","2022 officially requires a 6th gen core, and youâ€™re only 4th gen, so itâ€™s likely just not up to the baseline performance requirement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

how is the airflow around the adapter?,is it overheating?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"don't know how i can check if it's overheating, it's right above my gpu but it used to work fine and the temp of the rest of my components are fine.",i think it's related to a windows update or driver issue,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it probably is a driver issue but iâ€™ve seen some fail in laptops because they blow heat from cpu on them after a year or two.,usually it starts with connection drops and bad performance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

my coolermaster keeps my i7 8700k at the +80c.,"i donâ€™t think they are good coolers, also the copper plate on the pump is not polished.",it has horizontal lines rough surface.,is that normal?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
too bad stock coolers are still unusably bad.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes because tesla didnt have time... of course intel doesnt make the coolers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably made by the cheapest builders at the time of the orders.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why not?,"intel makes chips, not fans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i use a stock cooler on my i-5 and itâ€™s never overheated on me.,i find unless you are gaming and stressing the cpu to the extreme the stock coolers are just fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

do you have e cores on or off.,and what clock speed are p cores at under full load.,"i have e cores all disabled and p cores at 5.6ghz with 1.35v llc 6.

with my nh-d15, temps under full load cinebench r23 average 89 to 91c.",it runs hot though within spec.,i would have thought even at 5.6ghz with e cores off would have provided enough thermal headroom to have better temps.,if your e cores are on and p cores clocked nearly as high as mine my cooling setup or mount must be crappy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good.,i turn off too.,13900k in my gigabite z690 gaming x had turn on by default.,and bclk was set at 103.5 (clock go to 6 ghz insted 5.8 ghz) i change to normal 100.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
everything is stock currently with e cores on.,it runs 5.5 or 5.8ghz.,i hadn't attempted to tweak just yet as the load temps were too high for my preference with such a beefy air cooler.,i haven't gone over 89c yet at 100% load but i only ran it for about 5 minutes.,"the back of the pc i/o panel is already too hot for my liking and i'll probably end up see how close i can get to stock speeds while under volting instead of what i normally do (maxing out speed)

i also switched over to liquid metal on my last build from paste and that helps with temps a couple degrees too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do the p cores maintain 5.5ghz all core the whole time when running cinebench r23?,"&#x200b;

does this work if i bought the cpu but i don't have a code?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same here.,i did redeem it last night.,"was quite frustrated at first but hey, free game at the value of a$109, canâ€™t complain for a bit of f5 refreshes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how?,mine says ref 003?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
still ref.,004 error.,submitted ticket (althoguh i suspect i never got an actual ticket number) two days ago.,"all i have gotten so far is ""keep trying, and if error persists, contact us again with invoice and master code"", which i also did yesterday...  
this is insane, quite frankly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the weekend is though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if that cpu gen is in supported list, then contact them via email or just comeback the place you bought.",in here they will send via email or give a card contains master key,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i literally came back to pc after like 12hrs since my last attempt and it just worked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe try clearing your browser or rebooting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
were you able to file a ticket at https://softwareoffer.intel.com/support?,dm me your email and i will let them know we've interfaced.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm having the same thing i wish someone would help,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well i guess iâ€™m not getting it anytime soon then.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"dmed, thanks!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thank you!,was hoping my 13th gen chip would qualify but unfortunately not :(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got it with my 13900k purchase eventhough it isn't on the list.,probably still a good idea to try get it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you contact support to get it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not sure which store you purchased from but i live in new zealand and purchased from pb technologies.,they had a page where you could submit your order number and they send you the code.,i didn't have to go through intel support.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i see, no such thing for usa best buy, probably not getting it :(",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i found this support post.,looks like you might be able to get your code by messaging the support.,https://forums.bestbuy.com/t5/bestbuy-com/never-got-the-master-key-for-the-intel-core-i9-13900k/m-p/1415015#u1415015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks, i got the 13700k, hopefully something still applies!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you manage to get it?,i also got a 13700k but im in sri lanka.,"no qualifying retailers here, only scalpers!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"bruh you can't upgrade your integrated graphics from hd 3000 to hd 4000. it's hardware, not software.",use appropriate drivers for your graphics chip only,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
redditor moment ðÿ’€,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i saw a video of someone upgrading to intel 4000 that's why i asked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they both use the same event listener and call functions as shown in the developer manual .,"it works because no function has changed,  the intel hd 4000 has more transistors.",that's it .,"it doesn't make it any faster unless the software did something to make it faster , the fastest intel hd 3000 software is currently the mesa drivers in linux, hence why it's laughable",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"

1)intel 3000 and intel 4000 is the same unless you get some better software which is in linux

2)if i overclock the driver to intel 4000 nothing will change?",3)since the function doesn't change can i upgrade to intel 4000 anyway?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can upgrade it to intel hd 4000 graphics.,something might change but not much.,the developer manual is open source.,it just doesn't magically make intel hd 3000 into intel hd 4000 physically transistor wise.,intel graphics on linux is already overclocked.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
marginally.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wow.... so i can't get a better performance than the older one eh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thank you!!,!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
try now i just now was able to finally get the redeem button to work,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you yet to get your master key?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah now itâ€™s showing ref:003 error much faster .,!,well i hope they give us keys soon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ref 004 for me wow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
man idk wtf ya'll expecting when it's probably a couple thousand people completely hammering the page because ya'll can't wait a couple hours or a day.,yes it should have been handled better (i.e.,"give codes in advance and make them active on launch day, tho that would have killed battle.net anyways)

anyhow, intel is doing you a service by giving you a free game and you complain as if you bought the game.","yes they did promise you a game if you buy the cpu, and yes you will get it (just message support smh).",but stop acting as if you paid for it.,it was a free gift.,"and iirc this is the first time the website died this hard, though idk wtf they expected when they know the game is popular as heck",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
time to switch to amd after this mess lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"try again

"i am getting the same thing, hope it works soon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got past that to get to a 404 error page repeatedly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for your patience.,our redemption site is stable and running with our customers able to redeem cod with minimal issues.,"if you still experience any problems, please submit a ticket to the intel software advantage support team at softwareoffer.intel.com/support and we will respond to take care of your needs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
im getting ref 002,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>man idk wtf ya'll expecting when it's probably a couple thousand people completely hammering the page because ya'll can't wait a couple hours or a day.,if there are already 10+ posts about the same error and a person still posts a new one then you expect too much from them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
been more than a couple hours or a day.,i'd expect a 100 billion dollar international tech company to be able to distribute game codes they sold on or before the day the game comes out.,every other game distribution platform manages to do it.,i feel like that's not expecting a lot.,it's now like 48 hrs in.,still doesn't work.,and the game isn't free.,it was a bundled sale.,they sold full price cpus with the game.,"they can label it a ""free gift"" but that doesn't make it so.",it was a product they advertised that came with their product to sell it.,weird to defend such a screw up.,but intel stans will i guess.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got my uncharted from my 5700x purchase no issue!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep.,i am returning my intel cpus to micro center tomorrow and picking up their 7700x/mobo/ram bundles.,done with intel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
go try it now.,page is back up and it worked first try for me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hello!!,i have been waiting days and i still have this issue.,"i submitted a ticket, in which they claimed it has been ""fixed"" and that i can ""redeem it now"" but i am still getting the same issue.","i have messaged the twitter account, and the support team, please help :(",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s important to make no intel look as dumb as possible when they deserve it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you based your buy by the game code instead of the product itself?,"thats pathetic lol

(and im an amd user)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
respect,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't believe you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they are no longer responding to me btw,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hey, i'm sorry you are still having issues.","if you receive the error messages 001, 002, 003 or 004, your account is blocked and the only way to evaluate the issue is to contact the intelâ® software advantage program customer support team here at this link (softwareoffer.intel.com/support).","more information you provide in your first submission, the quicker the team will be able to help you.",you will be required to provide your proof of purchase receipt and master key voucher to be unblocked in most cases.,note codes purchased from unauthorized/non-participating resellers like are not valid.,these terms are stated in the terms and conditions for your offer in the general section.,click this link to see terms in section 8 as an example.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in this strategy the only ones who look dumb are the people reposting it.,instead of having one post with hundreds of upvotes you decide to create multiple posts with each one having low upvotes which means they aren't that noticeable and might not get the attention it needs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there's no code with the amd bundle so you can't get this error.,"checkmate, intel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,i didnâ€™t.,this is just my annoyed response.,i was on the fence about which,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at least i didn't waste money on a 13th gen cpu i guess.,they seem about as pointless as 11th gen did.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
slow but seems to be working,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i cant see the link you are trying to send in terms of section 8, but i appreciate the information!",do you recommend i wait for the support team to reply?,or should i submit another ticket?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"one post with a lot of upvotes is great and everything, but also easy to scroll past.",a sub dominated by similar complaints is hard to ignore.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for one youâ€™re picking an absolutely random reason to switch platforms, i mean youâ€™re too impatient to wait maybe a day or try again every couple hours to get a code?",yeah itâ€™s a shitty software but itâ€™s not that big of a deal.,not to mention the irony of complaining about 13th gen being â€œ11th genâ€ all over again being completely false.,thereâ€™s a good sizeable performance gain with every single sku released as well as a core increase.,this does come with a power demand increase but thatâ€™s mainly irrelevant.,"so either youâ€™re just grasping at straws to find validation to switch to zen 4 because thatâ€™s what you truly wanted, or youâ€™re flat out lying.","have fun paying more for ddr5, am5 motherboards and the cpu together as well as being an early adopter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you already have 12tb gen there is little reason to make the tiny jump to 13th,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thatâ€™s always going to be true though, thereâ€™s almost never an incentive to switch over a single generation.",most people will keep their parts for 2-4 years and by then thereâ€™s a completely new socket.,"but if someone is buying low to low mid range, like a i3 12100 or i5 12400, thereâ€™s still incentive to upgrade to even a 13600k.","not a huge performance increase but definitely enough to notice, especially if youâ€™re cpu bound.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wouldnt doubt theres tens of thousands of ppl trying to access it to get there fn keys and noone is getting any cause it just keeps getting overloaded lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just got mine redeemed and downloading now finally.,had to provide my mobile number to download though.,country: us,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, this is the same error i am getting now as well.",was finally able to get to the redeem button and of course it doesn't work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"me along with my buddies who upgraded are sitting blank .. getting opps,site down, and web error messages.",update: site loading faster but now its showing out of keys or ref:003 error.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
has anyone got past ref 002?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"day 3: still no code, i look upon this desert void of codes and see my people, starving, tired, desperate.",intel still sends no word of support.,we believe they have abandoned us.,if they return we shall show no mercy to our betrayers.,the time for forgiveness has passed.,*angry middle eastern music plays in the background*,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i am getting that but mine says ""ref.",003: an error has occurred.,"please contact customer support for assistance.""",instead.,very infuriating.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™m getting a ref 003 error, when i contacted intel they told me that a ticket has been created and that the department is off for the weekend.",just fucking fantastic i guess,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep that's a good majority of the people i bought my intel cpu two months ago and i was promised on the 28th i'd be able to play even though everyone else is getting a week early access we did not so at midnight i tried and i couldn't even load the page 10 hours went by i was finally able to start loading the page slowly and it kept giving me errors and it still is as of right now giving me errors and not letting me download the product.,thanks intel software advantage i'm not sure what the advantage is to not being able to play a game days after was released good job.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
been trying for almost 36 hours.,still cant get in.,ref 002. i will never buy another intel product lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this is just outrageous, iv been staring at an intel screen loading page for the past 24hours and nothing is happening",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"at least it isnt just me, this is a nightmare lol.",ppl gonna be prestige 5 by the time i download lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
getting the same error.,how the hell does one of the biggest tech companies in the world end up being this unprepared for the launch.,they had to have had an idea of how many accounts were created and how many keys would be going out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
getting ref004 here..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wait what is this, everyone with an intel/battle.net account can get cod:mw for free?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
anyone know if intel work in weekend?,or we have to wait until monday?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this item has been successfully redeemed and added to your battle.net account.,"after almost 2 days of trying, i logged out and in again and suddenly it worked.",was endlesss error ref003 before.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
im getting error ref 002 as well.,created a small python script to keep opening new tabs and click redeem on each tab consequently.,script has reached around 2000 tabs opened with their buttons redeemed and they all came back with the same fucking error,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
now its ref 004. it just keeps getting better and better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hello, after so many hours i finally managed to claim the game, i opened a ticket in the technical support section of the page of intel, but also something that i think influenced the quick solution, is that i opened a dm on the twitter profile of intel gaming, i received a very kind response and they told me that they would give priority to my tickets that i had previously opened (those tickets were created since the the first day), the staff commented that from 8: 30 am pdt, the technical support would begin to work this day, so if anyone still has these problems i encourage you to write to the twitter account intel gaming, provide your master key, the purchase invoice, screenshot of the error and specify the emails of the battle net account you are trying to link and the email of your intel advantage account where you have the cod bundle.",all this in order to speed up the process.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"still nothing, day one my ass !",[gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how the fuck does this error still exist.,its been days,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great!,"now i am getting this

https://imgur.com/a/2c4xxta",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s so embarrassing.,been waiting a whole day for it now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
someone on a different post said something about just trying 20 tabs at the same time.. eventually one will work.,"thatâ€™s how i got it to go through, been stuck on that screen last night.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
finally worked here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"back to you, steve!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
still not working over here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
anyone find a way to get rid of the ref 003 error yet?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"its not an error anymore, its a new function every hour !",[gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sunglasses),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at least you're eligible.,i bought 2x13700k's from central computers and can't get a code for gotham knights.,why they want to force customers to use newegg who are notoriously terrible is beyond me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's weird how i have 4 games in my bundle, even after not having gotham knight initially (support needed to add this manually or sth), and now all redeem except mw2 and bloodhunt.",bloodhunt actually also gives the same ref.,003 error as mw2.,"&#x200b;

i do hope this gets fixed soon... was looking forward to a weekend of shooting virtual baddies

&#x200b;

edit: interesting development.. turns out if you try to reset your password, it'll give a message saying your account is locked, though logging in via a 3rd party will get you into the account.",can anyone who also has the ref.,003 confirm this lock?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i get this... https://prnt.sc/87aivsq9wgrm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i signed out of my social media account to re-sign into intel dashboard and managed to get rid of the 303 error.,i don't know if this is because of it being fixed and a coincidence or if it is a solution.,i did it because this is a common cause for accounts being locked on the faq.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
try use microsoft edge browser,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well still getting endless ref.,002 errors this morning.,woke up to a replay from intel customer support but they just asked for pictures of the email including the masterkey code and a picture of the receipt of purchase.,mind you i included the masterkey code itself in the original support ticket.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™m getting error 003, been trying all day.",thinking of giving up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
update from singapore: was able to get it at last.,"been having ref 003 error whole day yesterday (sg time), now it is just error without ref number, and after refreshing for about 5 minutes, the game is added to my battlenet and is downloading now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this has been a disaster.,still not working.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what no one is saying.,itâ€™s not luck.,email intel support and dm them on twitter.,they are fixing the problem.,they need to unlock your account.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
finally after a hundred times i tried to redeem my game the item has been successfully redeemed and added to my battle.net account said intel but i can't find it on my account (i have only one account on battle.net)!ðÿ™ƒ.,where's my game?!!,!.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"day 4: still no code, i either get an error or a message saying out of codes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™m just venting at this point, but legit i donâ€™t even have time to spam the webpage, i work a full time job and my grandma had a stroke a couple of days ago.",so this is just the cherry on top of the overall cloud over me atm lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"update: after almost a week, i have finally accessed my code and the game.",if you get the 002 error you have to contact intel.,there is no choice unfortunately,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you get ref 003?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"when i talked to customer support they legit asked for the key, when the support ticket was literally about how i couldnâ€™t get it, then just stopped responding.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm getting ref 003 too.,was looking forward to playing it this weekend because work makes it difficult to play on weekdays but now i doubt that's gonna happen.,adulthood never fails to disappoint.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nope,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
im getting error ref 002 as well.,created a small python script to keep opening new tabs and click redeem on each tab consequently.,script has reached around 2000 tabs opened with their buttons redeemed and they all came back with the same fucking error,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whats the region of ur [battle.net](https://battle.net) account ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you need a hobby my friend,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"itâ€™s ridiculous, i bought the cpu with this code almost 2 months ago, how tf did they not have this sorted?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they probably farmed it out to some other company.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lmao no.,you neeeed to buy an 11th gen/12 gen intel cpu and get a master key.,or an a750/a770,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with purchase if 11th or 12th gen cpu or arc gpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
swing that...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i still havenâ€™t gotten my code either lmao,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
contact intel support and dm them in intel gaming (twitter account),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah me too.,the site must be down..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same lol god this sucks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same.,its loading fast now but ref.,002 error every time i click redeem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mine finally worked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is it doing now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably leverage.,newegg is huge.,i noticed b&h lost their offer long before newegg.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
already am,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ive tried support, its has been very unhelpful.",just dm'd intel gaming.,"fully expect to get ignored lol

&#x200b;

edit: messages finally got through and they unlocked my account.",this is the way people.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"unfortunately, i contacted with support, they told me in the morning that the site was stable and i should try to redeem again.","yeah, i just got an error after pressing the button, i sent a reply explaining

they told me to provide my master key and the receipt of the intel product.",no answer yet.,i hope they fix this as soon as possible.,!,[gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|cry),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they don't get back.,canada,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just had mine fixed finally.,after over 24 hours of not hearing back on my support claim i direct messaged intel gaming on twitter and explained what was happening and sent screenshots of everything.,they responded within 30 mins saying they had flagged my support case high priority and just now i got a message from  support saying the error had been cleared and i could claim mw2.,seems like ref.,002 is an error that will never get fixed except on their end.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s the response that i got as well.,iâ€™m glad that i wasnâ€™t the only person dumbfounded by the message.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
exactly the same for me too like they should obviously have access to my account and see that my key is already been entered it's just a bullshit run around,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ever get it resolved?,"i reached out to support and they emailed back requiring purchase verification, but i haven't heard from them since.",still getting the same error.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yall got the upgraded error.,i'm still on ref 002. lmao,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not i buddy.,still trying every hour'ish and now the site is alot faster but ref 002 is always the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
east coast us,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mine is this game.,i know.... i should expect disappointment.,lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you guys login with facebook by any chance?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
okay lol that makes much more sense,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i did, they arent helping at all.","support said it was ""fixed"" and that i can ""claim it"" but its still giving error, i then asked the twitter account and they said they'll try to help, then they stopped responding.... dude what in the world is going on here",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i hope it's back up before the next cod is released,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™m never doing one of these intel bundles again â€œplay the game day oneâ€ hahahahahahaha 

intel releasing games is like intel releasing new nm chips, it never comes on time and by the time itâ€™s out everyone else has already done it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
now it is ref 003. but i think it will not stop.,intel - always surprise your customer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got the offer via b&h and even then the cpu came in the most beat up box and was left in the rain so i was terrified to open it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what email have you used??,also which retailer did you buy it from?,?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"dm intel gaming on twitter about this, they helped me too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i sent them a dm so hopefully they respond,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nope they ghosted me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"what is 002 and 003, and so on?",i'm getting 002.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same.,iâ€™m not obsessing anymore.,but still trying every hour or so.,did you submit a ticket and get a response?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep i still can't play the game,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as far as i reckon these ref codes represent the region of ur [battle.net](https://battle.net) account i get 004 and my account has eu currency and country is pakistan.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hey yes i did.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and still same ref 004 its been 24 hrs now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when they said they fixed it i had to log out and log back in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i am so discouraged.,the only reason i went with intel for my spare parts build was because of this deal.,sooooo damn frustrating!!,!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"their definition of ""day one"" is very different than mine, lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the website just decided to work when i tried again.,"i got tired of refreshing, so i left it for a couple of hours and came back, but that probably has nothing to do with it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tomorrow it will be ref 004 prolly lmao,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"me too, but when the package arrived it had a missing cpu.",somebody had opened the package seal and taken out the cpu.,not sure where it happened.,they replaced it though.,i did not have any packaging issues with b&h though.,"i did get the intel offer through b&h, but shortly after they lost the offer.","when i asked, they said intel decided to end it early.","looked at newegg, still there.",ðÿ¤·â€â™‚ï¸,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ðÿ¤·ðÿ»â€â™‚ï¸,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nope not going to waste my time with a ticket.,itâ€™s intel slacking on codes.,they are using the error message as a way to make people think thereâ€™s a problem and there could be a solution by submitting a ticket.,honestly iâ€™m pretty sure it may be a few days or a week of trying before we all get our downloads.,some people got lucky by spamming ( i heard)  but i canâ€™t sit at my computer and waste the entire weekend hoping to get lucky.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
any luck today?,i still got same error twice this morning.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got ref.,"003, â‚¬ currency poland, so 003 is propably europe error",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nice, i did aswell.",so this is tied to some kinda login problem...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i tried that and nothing has worked.,support has not been replying to me anymore.,twitter account wont reply to me anymore.,this is unfair,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes and i have been told by people from latin america that they can redeem it just fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"maybe, u could say that , what happened just now is that i tried to verify my email ( same email linked to fb) and they just locked out my email.",but i can still login if i use the login with facebook option.,"however if i try to directly login with my email it says this account is locked ,contact the support to unlock it etc and the support seems to be afk since 3 days .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i know a few people in poland redeemed their game normally, so it's probably coincidence and we are damn unlucky.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so i managed to get mine , i went into the dashboard and clicked on intel call of duty bundle and opened like 10 tabs and just went through each one until one of them went all the way and added the game to my bnet acc",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel is a fucking circus, they've had months to prepare and it seems like they did absolutely nothing.",it's pissing me off so much.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"absolutely ridiculous, i've had my account setup since late august and i can't get the software i paid for.",the only reason i bought the cpu i did was for the key.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
class action lawsuit incoming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is the way,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is exactly what i did lol.,i was worried i wouldnâ€™t get a code because i heard of some people never even receiving anything for other products and i didnâ€™t want to take the chance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"from what i heard activision is also to blame apparently as it says sometimes that the codes are finished, this has been quite messy tho",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
on what grounds?,the website said it would available on the 28th not that you would get it on the 28th and since some people were able to get their keys then you don't have a case i guess.,but good luck none the less.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seems to be plenty of evidence that for many people there was nothing available.,so those grounds.,not getting access to what you paid for when it was advertised it would be available.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sierra forest xeons.,"they're shuffling their way towards systems in 2024, but it's unlikely they'll make it to any consumer level board, as they're geared towards datacenter and cloud hosting.",there isn't much of a market for slow and wide processing in client computing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>why doesn't intel release a chip that is all (or almost all) e-cores?,"atom, celeron silver and pentium silver: i am a joke to you?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i *think* they had something like that planned for low power laptops and celeron/pentium tier cpus.,"and again big maybe, but iirc someone posted here something to an all e-core server cpu with a shitload of cores.",so it might be planned but maybe sorta delayed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe they will in future.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i saw a video where build zoid got the e cores at 4.7 or 4.8ghz and 1 p core at 2ghz to score like.,3900x which is somewhat impressive.,but i doubt a set up with 2 p cores and 32 e cores would be any cheaper than a similar scoring chip with a mix of them.,as if you don't push the p cores crazy hard a 32 e core chip would probably just score the same or less than the current 8 p core 16 e core set up.,removing 6 p cores and slapping 16 more e cores would probably not yield any meaningful multi core performance benefits.,unless op's use case is splitting the cores up like a vm where having more would enable more vms.,but then i agree at that point you should be thinking about a server anyways.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 10980xe has horrible single threaded performance - itâ€™s literally just 10% faster than a 6950x.,"the 13900k, on the other hand, is 90+% faster than the 10980xe single threaded, which would definitely make it a much better processor for gaming.","although, unless you need the massive multicore performance of the 10980xe, you would also be well served by the 13700k or even 13600k (which has about the same multicore performance as the 10980xe, but much better single threaded).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have considered just buying the game.,been trying this for over 24 hours and it won't work.,"this promotion was the deciding factor when i was buying my laptop for school, but after this shitshow makes me think this was the wrong pic.",doesn't make me want to purchase from intel again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they said 28th, and the 28th came and went under maintenance, itâ€™s not privilege, itâ€™s common sense",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"well yes, i was just implying that people shouldn't be going so far because they can't get the game day 1, and have to wait a day since the website servers are ded.","it sucks, but in the end everyone is gonna get their game if they wait a couple days for the site to come back from the dead.",i was just getting fed up with all the fucking posts.,"like there's 2/3 posts in the past day about this, stop posting so much, it buries anything else that is even remotely interesting in the sub.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's weird it's telling you to download a copy, as intel is not offering codes to download mw2, but rather the game becomes available when you link your intel account to your battlenet account, and from the screenshots, it looks like account linkage succeeded.","i'd say to make sure you have a phone number associated to your battlenet account, as it is required by the game.","if you're still having issues, start by contacting support at [https://softwareoffer.intel.com/support](https://softwareoffer.intel.com/support)

i signed out of my social media account to re-sign into intel dashboard and managed to get rid of the 303 error.,i don't know if this is because of it being fixed and a coincidence or if it is a solution.,i did it because this is a common cause for accounts being locked on the faq.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

u fixxed it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's unironically exactly what's happening.,i've been able to recreate the redeem now option to redeem the game 3 times and two of the times it said they are out of codes.,not sure why but it's definitely an issue with codes and not server because you can recreate the redeem option by basically opening 20 tabs and using the tabs that work over and over and the end result is always out of codes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

code wise they should basically have unlimited codes.,seems like a activision issue of not supplying the codes fast enough more than intel.,or maybe just because the website was so dead that error message would just display instead of another error message.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"remember that 13th gen is basically one model faster than 12th gen. so a 13600k performs like a 12700k, the 13700k like the 12900k (and then some).",so that can be helpful when seeing if 12th gen pricing is good or not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what will be your use case ?,what i describe here assumes a multipurpose rig with a focus on gaming.,i'd say go for a 13600k with a ddr4 alder lake motherboard to save a few bucks.,"overclocking your cpu is not as useful as it was, you can use a regular b series motherboard.",use your saved money for a better gpu or new/bigger ssd.,amd will unveil their new gpu lineup next week with rumors suggesting excellent performance for the price.,so it might be worth to wait before upgrading your gpu.,"on nvidia's side, things are a bit sad right now : either 2 year old gpus or the crazy expensive 4080/4090 which have a bad buzz regarding their psu connector bursting into flames",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i got the 13900kf right now, and honestly, it performs the same as my 12700k and 12900k did in warzone and racing games.","&#x200b;

this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i do recommend taking a peek at used 12th series prices.,i just bought 12900k for 40â‚¬ below what 13600k costs here.,right now might be the best time to get cheap 12th gen as many high end users are upgrading to 13th gen and selling their old gear.,but like you said do check if the prices are good in your local area.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so z690 series motherboard.,i heard i will need to update bios of the motherboad before i can get 13600 to work.,or 13th series cpu will work without bios update?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
encouraging to hear.,i got a 12700k for $240 at microcenter a week or two before 13th gen launched.,"iâ€™ve been seriously wondering if i made a mistake, but have figured the difference in gaming performance is just a few percent",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,almost certainly you would need a bios update.,so buy a board with bios flashback so you donâ€™t need a 12th gen cpu to do it.,"most msi and gigabyte z690 have it, asus from rog strix and higher.",avoid prime and tuf.,verify that the specific board has it first.,"much fewer b660 boards have it, mostly gigabyte and a single asus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe.,what is 15?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've never heard of sata stealing pcie lanes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,sata goes thru the chipset lanes and cannot steal anything from the gpu.,the only way to steal anything from the gpu is if you have multiple graphics cards plugged in.,"having multiple nvme's plugged in could also do this, but as far as i am aware it mostly depends on how the motherboard vendor sets it up and it doesn't really happen.","but anyways, no, sata won't steal pcie lanes from the gpu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

your should undervolt your 9900k so that you don't lose performance as just limiting the temp will have it down clock.,using a negative offset most chips can be stable around -0.100v or 100mv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"oh, okay!",good to know.,"i havenâ€™t heard anything bad about the new chip yet, but theyâ€™re still very new on the market.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not across the entire range.,"msi is being extremely ambiguous in certain motherboards like the pro z790-p wifi ddr4 because instead of saying i225-v like in previous generation, now it is a generic ""intel 2.5gbps lan"" as if it could be either the old i225-v or the new i226-v:  
https://www.msi.com/motherboard/pro-z790-p-wifi-ddr4/specification  
no info on website, specifications or manual about what it is.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looked at your other post.,the prime z690-p won't have a bios that can recognize the 13th gen cpus if you've just bought it new.,you'll have to take it to a shop and have someone use a 12th gen cpu to update the bios in order to properly support your 13th gen cpu.,"there's no dedicated bios flashback option (which can update a bios from a usb stick, without needing a cpu or memory installed), unfortunately.",eta: any bios [from version 1620 or newer](https://www.asus.com/motherboards-components/motherboards/prime/prime-z690-p/helpdesk_bios/) will be needed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

p model don't have that feature.,a models do.,so would need a 12 th gen cpu to update the bios.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most z690 boards currently available would need a bios update.,"only boards made from about july onwards will have a new enough bios to be able to boot 13th gen, and thereâ€™s really know way to verify/guarantee that sort of thing.","however, better boards have a feature called â€œbios flashbackâ€ that allows you to flash the bios without a cpu installed.",the asus prime board you have lacks this feature.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

are you billionaire now?,!,[gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|money_face),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hmmm.,cyrix.,â€œmostlyâ€ x86 compliant.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wow i think i had most of those chips, but since i did the sell and upgrade program, i don't have them anymore.",i see the pentium pro in there.,that was neat chip with fast full speed cache before intel started putting 1/2 speed caches on their cartridge cpus.,"is that a celery 300a ""450""?",those were good times.,helped a bunch of buddies build and do the easy o/c on those.,those cyrix/ibm chips were the worst.,never felt as fast as the supposed intel equivalent cpu and fpu was junk on those things.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and you still haven't bought a motherboard for all those cpu's :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
holy crap you could make a museum look like rookies!,thank you for sharing and being a great person... i know some would just melt them down for the gold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i see a slot a athlon in your collection too.,early athlons had no on-die cache and amd had to package it and its external cache in a cartridge and it used the same physical connector as intel.,electronically incompatible with slot 1 intel p2 and p3 boards though since the k7/athlon had its own bus that was based on the same one used by dec's alpha.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what's the dual slocket in the top left?,some form of xeon?,"and what's the silver thing in the middle, large silver cover with a exposed die below the five slotted cpus in the middle starting with the amd and to the left of the i think powerpc processors, and above the cyrix mii.",and what is the bottom right most one that's just a black heatsink with four bolts or whatever?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
still remember my first dual p2 board with a pci scsi controller.,could store almost 100gb,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
theres a amd performance dal cpu in the box  i used to have one but they never truely released them to the public as they had so many problems with them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"remember rambus lol

i member!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
*laughs in 2013 dual-core intel celeron at 1.8ghz*,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my man,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my first intel was an 8088 â€¦ i must be ancient!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thereâ€™s a 386dx and 387dx math coprocessor too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you had a 3dfx card in a 486 dx2 i would be surprised.,i was a pretty early adopter in the mid 1990's and i think i had mine on a pentium 200mhz in maybe 1997?,"it was a voodoo 2..   

i might be totally remembering all of this wrong,  im drunk and on the toilet typing this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> i even got windows 95 on there, but had to exit to dos to play most games at the time since i did nto have enough ram to run both.",now that's old.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iirc, the recommended minimum platform for the original voodoo was a pentium or an equivalent amd chip like the k6 since most games that took advantage of its 3d acceleration like quake were optimized for 586 and a 486 would have been slow.",the 3dfx video card would have needed a pci slot and most 486 systems were either isa or isa and vlb until late in the 486-era.,"edit: i once owned a 486 system with a 120mhz amd-made 486 and the motherboard had pci slots instead of vlb, though it was a later board that was made circa-1995.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pentium 2 or 3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i vaguely remember that i had a celeron 300 chip that did 450mhz so a 50% overclock which looked similar.,p2 or p3 era i think.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same.,i remember when i was first learning about 86 thinking my 8088 was a typo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
honestly i am not sure.,"i had one around that time, but it could have been a later computer.","looking at timelines...your right, it had to be later that i had one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nah sound about right.,i had a voodoo 1 passthrough card and pentiums were already a thing when those came out.,i had an ibm processor in my first pc but definitely newer gen than a 486.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looks exactly like my retail box coppermine slot 1 p3 800 chips.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is intel planning on fixing distribution speeds on these arc a770 16gb gpus?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
doubt it.,they can't even fix a website.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
distribution speed?,ðÿ¤”,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> idle power consumption is still far higher than it should be.,"there's a fix for that, but only if your motherboard supports certain functions.",see: https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/high-idle-power-use-on-intel-arc-gpus-requires-fiddling-with-bios-settings/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that grey text on greyish blue background is a bit challenging from a readability standpoint.,"gentle feedback, for what it's worth.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most people have no reason to touch something like cinebench.,a cpu that hits 100c in cinebench might struggle to hit 70c in a game.,test cpus with the most demanding application that you will use regularly.,"and, yes, a cheap air cooler is fine for a 13900k in games.",most games pull between 100-150 watts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks.,i changed it to a different theme for now.,i'm gonna have to learn how to create one of these themes on my own.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why would you buy a cpu that only uses 30% of its performance in the first place?,the reason why you see less power consuption and temps in gaming because you are not using all the performance of the cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cheers!,"yeah, settling on a good all-rounder color template is a tricky thing.","you'll want to test it on a few different types of displays, too, to cover different viewing conditions.","oled, va, ips, mobile, tablet, daytime... it's a process!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not really, my 12700k hit ~80w at stock settings even during something as light as r6s.","it's a non-issue imo, but most high-end cpus are quite power hungry when you actually use them for something.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cpu usage/power is tied to ram speed as well as game resolution.,"if you have awful ram speed, your cpu will seem really efficient .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just playing, but, to be fair, stock settings are very aggressive on a lot of motherboards.","that power consumption was mostly due to the board (z690 tomahawk) pushing 1.3v at all times, and that was running the stock 4.7ghz all core and 4.9ghz max boost.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes it does, i've tested/owned everything from laptops to desktops

core 10th, 11th, 12th and 13th.","ddr4 and 5

amd cezanne 5600g/5800h to vermeer 5950x

ram causes the cpu to use more because ram is itself a bottleneck in games

just increasing fclk on amd cezanne increases cpu power

gear 1/2 on 11th gen and up also does the same.",upping ramspeed/tightening timings does it even more,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got battlenet and everything linked last night but it was out of codes and now the site is down,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
!,[gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|downvote),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i had to click here a second time because the first time it brought me to an opps page.,it will eventually ask you to link your bnet account to intel and you will be golden.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i linked my intel account to [battle.net](https://battle.net) but i don't have a redeem now button.,what should i do?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
where the hell do you get the codes from,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i gave up and bought the vault edition on battle.net so i could play with the homies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what did you press again the redeem now button disapperas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no i have linked and linked my bnet acc with intel so many times but it didn't work,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same prob here :(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
where it say to link the battle net account press here itâ€™s in blue,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thx,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no problem hope it works for you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"damn sorry brother, i did mine at 330am before everyone was awake.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
now they are out of codes im gonna start crying i have tryed for like 6hoursers now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i also tried at 3am and it was down :(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

some people have had limited success redeeming via mobile.,no idea if better because i decided to mash f5 for 16 hours.,it's possible this is activisions doing by not releasing keys/permission/whatever (to intel) until  general release instead of allowing preload on bn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

how long did it take for it to get added to ur account i just redeemed it and i dont see it anywhere,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was able to get to the point where i linked it to battle.net accountâ€¦ but still didnâ€™t receive a game,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
correct.,the publishers (activision) can pretty much dictate what happens with their ip.,activision may have deliberately hobbled the release through intel to generate discussion/hate/publicity.,with so many willing paying customers there is no such thing as bad publicity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

try to refresh the page and redeemed it i thought i redeemed it because i clicked redeem and it disappeared but when you click redeem it needs to say redeemed added to you [battle.net](https://battle.net) or something along those lines,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
now down again >.<,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just worked!!,!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so now the site is down, weâ€™ll done intel",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we're all in the same boat... smart intel decided to release codes to everyone at once rather than rolling out before release and allowing people to preload.,now the servers are overloaded and no one can get in.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hey, i've literally been trying for over 1 hour.",just managed to get it about 5min ago.,"i kept getting your screen, followed then by an ""oops something is wrong"" message.",but kept closing and refreshing.,took just over an hour.,[finally got it validated](https://i.ibb.co/pn8vjtj/screenshot-2022-10-28-100718.png).,don't give up!,however - an absolute shitshow by intel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so this can be reported as false advertising when it seems like the majority of people canâ€™t actually get the game on october 28th as advertised, and apparently maliciously if they donâ€™t even have the codes available they sold us with the part (and yes, intel, i saw your cute response of you not â€œrunning outâ€ of codes, nice wording).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how embarrassing for intel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
time to sue for false advertisement :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is a disaster!!,edit: currently at 45 minutes of trying!!,edit 2: still trying!!!,4hours,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"site just says it's down for maintenance now lol, what a joke.","imagine if the company had actually just let us preload the game a week ago, what a concept.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"major bruh moment, i just get ""scheduled maintenance""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah if you look closely into the subreddit you posted to you can see that every single post is about the same issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
still broken for me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yup, still getting this page.",ridiculous!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s still happening i am getting the same screen as you and itâ€™s really annoying but does that mean we can all sue intel for false advertisement?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m in the same situation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fuck me dead what a shitshow how does one of the very biggest tech companies drop the ball this hard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"still not in after trying on and off all day, it's officially war intel.",i may or may not purchase it out of hatred for thinking n believing they gave me a bundle offer for copping a pc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"omg intel come on, where is my swett cod mw 2 ?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wouldn't be surprised if activision/blizzard didn't limit their api to intel to release keys slowly in preparation for this to make their customers frustrated and just purchase the damn game with intel holding the bag.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

still down.,imo qualifies as a non provision of service.,wonder if that's a good reason to contest a purchase on cc....you know for whatever it was that you bought.,my xxxx accessory doesn't work and the website for that accessory is down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
im getting ref.,003: an error has occurred when i click on redeem now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"afaik, this offer included the arc a770, but i don't see it listed in the devices, it's all cpus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got in after trying for hours.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i signed out of my social media account to re-sign into intel dashboard and managed to get rid of the 303 error.,i don't know if this is because of it being fixed and a coincidence or if it is a solution.,i did it because this is a common cause for accounts being locked on the faq.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
does anyone have a computer with a processor that's compatible with this from best buy?,never got a master key from them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
im in guys!!!!!,after trying non stop for 2 hours!,muhauha its downloading!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it.,is.,still.,down.,:'),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's amazing that it's 2022 and a tech company still can't figure this out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
update?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"we refreshed them too much, when they knew they had no more codes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not just down for maintenance but scheduled maintenance.,bulls/ã·>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"never mind just got it, finally.",just keep refreshing you will get in eventually,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

cry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same :(.,just wanna download :(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i keep getting it to show then i click on the game and it says oh no error!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ive been trying non stop last hour.,was able to link my [battle.net](https://battle.net) account but when i hit redeem get error,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm getting that now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was also getting the error but i had opened multiple tabs and every tab was showing the redeem now button.,i clicked the button on every tab until i got the message that the product has already been redeemed and added to your battle.net account.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how??,i get ref error every time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not just a tech company.,one of the biggest!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
502 server error - still waiting...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did they give you a code to redeem or automatically placed the game in your battle net account ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah i got to the ref page and just click the here again and keep trying from there, i hope this is how people got it to work and iâ€™m not wasting my time",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that doesn't seem to work for me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i opened multiple tabs and kept on clicking refresh until i got in.,keep checking the bottom of the instructions box.,you will get a buttton for redeem now.,i think i did not see it earlier and kept on clicking refresh.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it is infact still down, wtaf is going on",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13 hours here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you link your intel account to battle.net than jt work s,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you checked your battle.net account?,is it showing intel mw2 account linked?,if not then keep on trying.,are you able to open other sites properly?,"the intel site was not opening properly till morning for me (i am in odisha, india) but now i am able to access the site without any hitch.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i get the redeem button, but every time i click it i get an error",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably just undersized system which crashed after too many download attempts.,give it a few days.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
disgusting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, intel is connected with my battlenet account.",once i click on redeem now i get that error message,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was also getting the error but i had opened multiple tabs and every tab was showing the redeem now button.,i clicked the button on every tab until i got the message that the product has already been redeemed and added to your battle.net account.,keep on trying it may take some time but it will be done.,but i cannot download game now because the power just went out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah i understand that, i do work in technology and do hold a computer science degree.","what i donâ€™t understand is why one of the largest tech development companies cannot operate a simple system, they knew there was going to be heavy traffic so why not have a queuing system implemented, it is just annoying",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
others also had ref.003 error and i think they got through in the end.,don't know why you are unable to get through?,have you tried resetting your connection and browser settings?,maybe that will help.,only other solution is to wait patiently for a few days.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ive hit that redeem now button probably north of 500 times and i dont think im getting anywhere with it lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wow thats a whole lot of tries.,take some rest and try after some time.,hope you get in soon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ref.,002 or 003?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did u have ref.002 or 003?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm getting ref.,002. been at it for hours.,"tried undoing the [battle.net](https://battle.net) link, launching in incognito mod, using different browsers and opening many many tabs at the same time and still no luck.",if anyone actually got past ref.,002 i'd love to know how lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ref 002,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
had so many issues since yesterday that don't remember the exact error.,"the site was slow to load, some 502 errors, site down errors, maintenance error, scheduled maintenance error.",sorry didn't keep a tab on the exact code.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"lipton must have had ref.003, i see people getting out of that but 002 seems to have no known workaround right now.","don't know what the error codes mean but i've been seeing this pattern unfortunately, i also have 002.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same.,"""**ref.",002: an error has occurred.,please contact customer support for assistance.,"**""  repeated attempts result in no change.","whether it's ref002, or ref003, or ref004.",it is encouraged to open a support ticket with https://softwareoffer.intel.com/support.,"_x000d_

no worries just trying to figure out a pattern here.,"seems people with 003 can finagle thier way out of 003 but i have yet to see a resolution or workaround for 002. those are also the only error codes i've seen regarding the ""redeem now"" ""ref"" codes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah probably.,hope others get through too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
u ever get it figured out?,im still getting ref 002,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its an issue me and others also currently have.,its probably best to wait a few hours as apparently there is a lot of issues with the codes right now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
website is getting hammered hard so it doesnt work properly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am facing the same issue too.,i'll just come back every few hours to see the status.,must be too many players logging in to claim the game thus overloading the servers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's easy, you opten file explorer then go to your main drive and delete system32 folder.",and you are good to go.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the page opened for me now.,under that picture there are links.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just do what i did, buy the actual game on bnet and opened a dispute with ur bank to get ur money back from buying intel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
site is down...intel servers are off,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

we are temporarily out of codes and are working to reload our system

"great job intel, you really thought this through ðÿ‘ðÿ¿",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"heads up, i just managed to get mine.",you may be able to now too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's a little wonky, just keep trying.",i finally got it to work late last night,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
does anyone know how i can get my master key somewhere; i have no idea where to find it.,i recently bought the newer cpus with the bundles but was asking me to redeem a master key but have no clue where it would be.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with your computer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if only they could have rolled the codes out slowly throughout the week letting people preload helping some with slower data speeds and taking some of the strain from intels own servers.,but what do i know.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"when i clicked next, its gone again :(",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
must be nice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's a hit or miss thing, i got to the ""link battle.net account'  page but after linking to intel and coming back on intel dashboard, nothing!","just keep reloading as i say, i'm in the grind too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same i link it then it goes straight back to dashboard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
find any fix to this yet?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same issue.,i presume the site is overloaded.,if you refresh a few times you'll eventually get the screen that mentions mw2 as premium software and some other bonus intel software.,"whenever i click on cod then, the website gets stuck for a minute or two then i get an error screen taking me back to dashboard",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
site is ded.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah also not able to guess we will have to wait unfortunately,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yup same here, i get to ""oops!","something went wrong"" screen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same and also get ready to chuck a massive cooler on that the cpu gets dangerously hot i bought a predator 5000 went to return it 2 weeks later coz of the heat and they said no so i stripped it put everything on a asus board added a aio and a new case coz it was hitting 95,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
having exact same issues,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the site has been down all morning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
still.not.working.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't see any place to download the game either.,the instructions indicate that you need to download the game within 30 days of submitting your master key.,i submitted my master key on september 21st which was more than 30 days before the game was available.,does this mean i won't be able to download it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep haven't been able to get anything to work correctly at all and now that the web pages are back up i keep getting reference code 002 contact customer service even though i've already contacted them multiple times they should have had us pre-download this a week ago so we could play the campaign early like everyone else but instead we keep getting dumped on this is ridiculous it's more than 24 hours after it launched and i still haven't been able to play the damn game,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if intel had any common sense and actually cared about the people who bought their stuff they would have let us have an actual game code that we could put into blizzard's website in the battle.net app and let us downloaded directly from them but instead we have to go through all this crap that doesn't even work real geniuses over there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ref.,002: an error has occurred.,please contact customer support for assistance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"guess i miss the window after they fixed the site 

â€œwe are temporarily out of codes and are working to reload our system.",please check back soon.â€,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just got mine, give it a try now!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, i guess iâ€™ll wait until tomorrow.","why we couldnâ€™t get a code to predownload the game, is beyond me.",wouldâ€™ve made this much easier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep it hasn't done crap for the last 24 hours when i've been trying to download it sometimes the web page won't load sometimes i get a weird error lately i've seen that the web pages are running good but when i try to redeem it it says reference 002 contact customer service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mine worked earlier!,keep trying ðÿ‘ðÿ¼,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
try at times people arenâ€™t on.,like i hopped on this morning and it worked immediately.,"also, i tried using google chrome and it was way smoother.",not sure if thatâ€™s just circumstance but iâ€™d recommend it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nope!,i downloaded.,i guess you just have to keep trying to get on the software advantage program.,i hopped on at 8 am my time this morning and started the download while i was at work,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"exactly what im getting on mine, this is so stupid.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it worked!,runs now!,just wish intel gave out an ounce of communication,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"site is down, yet again... for ""scheduled maintenance"".",bs strikes again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
true.,i knew this was coming anyway.,freebies for any large game - let alone probably the largest release all year - always brings websites to their knees.,usually it's sorted by next day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you don't mind me asking.,where did you buy your cpu from?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hopefully it worked out for you!,mine downloaded and played without a hitch earlier today.,iâ€™m glad there was so much communication from intel about the situation *not*,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this won't age well.,"still borked, going into a weekend.","i wrote to customer support who wanted copies of my receipts, and then stopped responding once i sent those in.","heading into a weekend, i doubt this will be fixed before next week.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"best buy, why?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same thing for me 2 months ago i was told i was going to get to play modern warfare 2 when it came out due to buying a intel cpu and here i am over 24 hours after lunch and still can't play it because i can't even redeem it because i keep getting error codes what a bunch of trash,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just tried it right now.,"worked straight away, with no delay.","so, yh, seems like it was a next day thing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the response.,"it's because i purchased a cpu from bestbuy and have not received an email with a ""master key"" so i was getting a bit worried.",how long did it take to get your email?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"still not working, getting a 002 contact support error.",absolutely not a next day thing.,see attached error.,"(customer support has already been contacted, prolly has the weekend off)

almost automatic after purchasing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well the website being over loaded and crashing was a next day thing because it was working by next day, just like your website is.","&#x200b;

you're having some type of error.",not sure what myself.,"&#x200b;

btw, don't sweat it if you're running an nvidia gpu.",game doesn't work properly with nvidia gpu's.,"texture tearing and screen tearing, makes it look like your gpu is dying, and there's been no fix yet, aside from rolling back drivers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh for real?,i'm having the same issue as well.,i purchased a qualifying cpu from bestbuy today and i still haven't received a code.,any idea when i could expect it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ohh.,thanks for the heads up regarding the driver.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got mine almost instantly.,iâ€™d check your inboxes/spam,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i bought the cpu only.,was supposed to buy a device containing the cpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no idea.,i didnâ€™t even know this was a deal until i purchased.,youâ€™d have to ask intel/best buy or wherever you purchased it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
time for upgrade cpu+mobo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"anyone at all, lol.","i know if i do need to upgrade, i'll have to get a new motherboard.","but if anyone has any idea, pls help.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in your case, yeah sounds like you'd benefit from an upgrade.","13th gen is great -- the 13600k is in a pretty good sweet spot, but if you don't have the budget for it, 12th gen chips (literally any of the desktop chips -- even a 12100f if you really need to scrimp) are a pretty big jump from what you currently have as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
few days ago i still had 6700 .,not anymore because now i have 13600k.,should i had done it ?,i'd don't know.,do i see difference ?,yes.,even in diablo 2 resurrected.,don't really look at that cpu/gpu % usage crap.,it will not tell you much.,from what i understand mw2 is very new gsme.,ofc it will stutter .,3050 isn't particularly great you know .just use common sense.,6700 is 7 generations old.,ofcourse modern cpu will be much faster and those games very likely will run better.,they not run super fast on 3050. best you can do with it is gaming on 1080p i guess.,yes you will need new motherboard for this upgrade.,it's good idea to plan upgrade like this reasonably to not half ass it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you have a 6th gen quad-core when 13th gen just came out.,so yes the new cpus are way faster.,you donâ€™t need to get crazy and can you just get something like a 13600k.,it is still way faster and you are not going to be limited.,"same thing with the board, donâ€™t waste your money on a high end board.","personally, i have a 12600k and a msi z690 pro-a and the cpu is not overworked at all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you will get better help in r/pcbuild,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"odd, i'm running a kinda similar system and honestly i've not noticed any real issues with stuff i'm playing.","(i7 7700k, ddr4 3600, rtx2060 6gb non super)

the most ""intensive"" game i've played recently has been cyberpunk on a mix of high and some medium settings on 1600p with \~40fps and before that it was hzd but maybe i'm just not paying enough attention to notice anything.",that being said i'm not in the d4 beta so maybe it's something specific to that game?,"i've been playing around with the idea to maybe move to a 12600 or 12700 closer to xmas but everytime i start pricing out components i end up thinking ""but all my games runs fine, do i really need to upgrade at this stage?","nah, let's just get another hdd for the fileserver"" :d",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my 6600k overclocked started to struggle quite a bit on modern titles.,i got a 12700k now and the performance difference is significant.,worth the upgrade if your performance is lacking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would say time to upgrade.,i7-6700 is fine for lighter games but struggles a lot in modern heavy games.,if you are looking for just a gaming system a 13600k would be a good choice.,combine it with some mid range b660 motherboard and you are good to go for next five years at least.,"i would still go with ddr4, ddr5 is still a bit too expensive to be worth it and you should be able to reuse your old ram if you want to.",if you are short on money a 12400f or even a 12100f with a lower end b660 motherboard would be a significant upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"went from a 6700 to a 5800x last year, while staying on a 1070 - it was really noticable, all buttery smooth now.","i mainly played poe at the time which is quite cpu heavy, and i imagine d4 will be too.",the 6700 is just dated now.,the good news is that if you are on a tighter budget you can go with last gen (am4 or 12th) and still have an appropriate upgrade.,no need to go all out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i figured it out, i was trying to run it 4k lol.","i changed that, and now itâ€™s running smooth.",iâ€™m an idiot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i cant even get on the website, gonna just check afterwork tomorrow",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you cant be serious ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"same boat as you, pretty whack!",don't want to have to buy the game and have two copies due to intel being ass.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why blame intel when they are given the keys by activision?,it's not like intel is generating the keys on the fly.,this is on activision for not giving intel enough keys.,edit: the site going down though that's on intel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wait how does one become eligable to this?,i just bought an 13900kf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

question.,very curious.,"where is it posted, by intel or activision, that ""keys"" are not available?",thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11 and 12th gen and arc gpus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can get a code with a 13th gen if your retailer is participating.,intel lists all of 13th gen as eligible but again participating retailer..... it's a stupid condition,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just use 1 tab and keep refreshing?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"can't connect to the url, when it does it says the page doesn't exist.",i think all there is to do is just wait and keep trying,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hey i just purchased a laptop from amazon with a qualifying cpu.,will i receive the email for the master key?,or is amazon not a participating retailer for the offer?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m not even getting a message?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got lucky apparently,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

has anyone had any luck yet?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just got it after about 2 hrs of trying damn that was frustrating as hell though and the fact that u gotta go through this then deal with blizzard and their app and the whole phone number fiasco well itâ€™s downloading at least,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
man i really wanted to play on launch day this is kinda upsetting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"site has been saying 

""service unavailable.","&#x200b;

the site is down for scheduled  maintenance.","please check back at later time.""",(with the silhouette of a dj performing in a club.),"&#x200b;

you guys scheduled maintenance on launch day?",what the fuck.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the page is super laggy and i canâ€™t even get to redeem stage.,this is outrageous,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
been this way since last night.,went live at 9pm pst.,server crashed.,tried it again just recently.,still loaded to the hilt.,got total war when i bought this chip in a snap a month or so ago.,i have no idea why they didn't let people load the game on their blizzard before launch.,they obviously did not build this site to handle the traffic it's receiving,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
linked my [battle.net](https://battle.net) account but stuck again xd,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i was able to connect my [battle.net](https://battle.net) account with intel - mw2, but still don't have access to the game as the page errored out after.",any thoughts?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just got it to work.,kept hitting reload while i was working.,after 3 hours of randomly clicking on it every 10 minutes or so it finally went though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got...this item has been successfully redeemed and added to your battle.net account.,but its not showing on my battlenet account yet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
some of my friends from peru is getting the game other than that no one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lets all sue intel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah bro the 3 ""scheduled maintenances"" in 1 day",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yup, broken ass website and when it does work its out of keys.",what a horrible company lmao,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"site is completely overloaded, nothing special that it doesn't work properly rn.",gonna be fine in a few hrs/days i guess,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"other keys are working atm, but itâ€™s not working just for mwii.",maybe they werenâ€™t expecting this many people want the game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's the same here in nz as well.,it's bogus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"having the same exact issue, let me know if anything gets fixed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is absurd lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i got the page to load and linked to my [battle.net](https://battle.net) account/allowed permission, aand then it timed out again :(",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"u gotta go back to the page you connect your [battle.net](https://battle.net) account, there should be a redeem now button beneath the instructions after connected",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
were you getting a ref 002 error beforehand?,thats what im dealing with,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"same here, any luck from your side?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
vpn time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe they shouldn't have sold so many cpu's lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is exactly what is happening to me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i got more errors than i could keep track of

everything from site maintenance to time out to clear your cache.",it was pretty impressive actually what a wide variety of errors i received ðÿ¤£,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nothing yet after 12 hrs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they can detect vpn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i just exclusively get ref 002 now, i guess i have to wait until support gets their shit together becasue ive been runnin this shit all day smh",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the only other difference might be if you have redeemed the code yet.,i did that maybe a month ago when i downloaded warhammer.,the majority of complaints i have seen from people who just can't get it to work were people who have never entered the code before,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you been able to get the game?,"a week in i'm still not able to download, support hasn't responded to a single ticket, and my account is giving ref error 2: your account has been blocked speak with support",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
will swap to a custom waterloop when i can get my hands on a decent 4090 with a waterblock for it.,then will see if i can push it even higher.,quite happy with the 13900k though!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5.8ghz all core oooo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice!,big score.,106.26 points per watt :)  at what temperature does it throttle?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am getting 40500 points w ddr4 3600mhz/cl16.,it hits 93c max.,is this normal guysss ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what vcore using ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what about undervoltage?,"i have no experience wirh 13th gen., but 11th & 12th with negative offset and load line calibration helps a lot - reduce power, temp., overall work culture, then higher freq.","without power limiter, thermal throttling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have the same cooler for my 13900k but i think i have a bad mount...cinebench for 10 min at stock settings a few cores hit thermal throttle.. (mce off) what are your results?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what cooler are you using?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it throttles at 100c.,i was just under that with one core hitting 99. i also now see i had not updated my hardware monitor so it was still showing it was a 12900k but of course it was the 13900k!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, that seems to be right in line with what you can expect.","games do not seem to push it anywhere near those temps though, which is a good thing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it was tweaked up 0.010 with intel xtu.,i don't remember for sure what it was but hwm show it there at 1.52.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i will probably undervolt for regular use but this run was to push and see how high i could get so i was expecting the high temps and potential throttling this time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at stock i can get the ten minute run without throttling and saw a high temp of about 96c.,so i agree you probably have a slightly off mount.,this run was a one shot to see how high i could get with a 5.8 all p core run.,i am running a cheap stabilizing plate on my mb to help with the contact.,i built the computer with it so never tested it with the default mounting plate to compare though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
corsair 150i elite lcd.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how are you cooling it and is mce on or off?,any custom settings?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
vid should be different from vcore tho,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i am running a z690 msi unify-x mb, 64gig 5600 cl40 ddr5, corsair h150i elite lcd, and a corsair ax1600i psu.",i loaded the xmp setting in the bios and that unlocked the power limits and it went to 5.6 on the p-cores.,then i used intel extreme tuning utility to up the p/e cores a couple and to tweak power up and down to get that run just below throttling temps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nice

what cpu cooler?","i should try this as mine def hits 100c in like 10 sec on my 360mm cooler

what volt reduction did you end on..or did you do a ppl limit?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh you have a 12900 sorry thought this was 13900

the app says 12900",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did not leave it running at this and i was bumping the voltage up and down while trying to keep it stable enough to get through a run of cinebench.,i believe this run a small bump over at like +.0010.,i dropped it down to 5.7pcore and 4.5 ecore for prolonged use.,i can run that with a -.0010 and it runs much better temps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>corsair h150i elite lcd,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had not updated my hardware monitor pro when i ran this.,i mentioned that earlier.,cinebench reports it correctly though and you can count the e-cores in hwm to see it really is a 13900k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ohhh ok

then yes i am curious about the downvolt num er or if you did a package power limit change instead",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i guess ces 2023?,jan 5-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

b760 boards and non-k cpus will come out early next year.,there are 2 things that play a role in memory overclocking.,"the connection between the cpu & ram/ the signal integrity, and the bios optimizations.",both of those things have nothing to do with the chipset.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

just got mine.,it just links to battlenet and says you have a copy.,wasn't even a code.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

they don't care... let's be ready to play for the holidays... poor joke - intel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
out of codes all the time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

oh my god!!!,"i have gotten the ""redeem"" button about 20-25 times, but every time i click it, it just disappears and then i have to click the ""here"" button for [battle.net](https://battle.net) which i have already done...

yeah been trying for more than 24 hours after buying the cpu with the offer for a copy of mw2 2 months ago.,not that it was bad enough that we didn't get access to the campaign like everyone else a week ago but now you cant even access your copy on the 28th like it says .,iv been dealing with pages not loading and various errors since midnight on the 27th .,its shameful.,if intel had half a brain they would of just given us a code to download directly from [battle.net](https://battle.net) app directly a week ago .,un f%$king believable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you intel for wasting my time :))))),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"this is ridiculous, no codes, servers down.",intel are so stupid that they didnâ€™t reserve the codes for people who have entered the master key.,so on launch they would be released to everyone.,instead of putting up codes and itâ€™s every man for themselves,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all i want is this game bro why they making it so hard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

can anyone help????,it says my items has been successfully redeemed after linking my battlenet account and its not even in my battlent account.,i did this over 8 hours ago.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

oops something went wrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
edit: i recommend doing this on a computer.,"use multiple tabs, open any new link in a new tab and just refresh that tab if it fails.","eventually you should get a ""redeem"" button like i just did.","now just 62gb download through shitty comcast...

finally got it!,us 4:35pm pt.,"once i got to the page that actually showed the games available in my bundle i didn't click the mwii link, instead i right clicked it and kept opening fresh tabs until one loaded and was able to link/redeem.","many, many errors and timeouts but this is what finally worked for me.",frustrating experience... hope everyone can get their copies soon!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"really easy to tell these guys donâ€™t have the right people to get this fixed like come on this couldâ€™ve been avoided so easily but just emailing the damn codes when the game release simple, like you have a bunch of traffic on your website that you cannot handle which is why all this is happening",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
apparently the maintenance will last for 4 hours,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"not that i'm complaining, but i thought they were going to give us the option between steam and battle.net, or was i misunderstanding/misinformed?","i'm just curious if i had clicked something in the account earlier in the month that made mine battle.net, or is that what they are giving everyone?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

because they want people to not redeem the codes.,seems pretty obvious.,same reason why mail in rebates are convoluted.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

just disconnected my [battle.net](https://battle.net) and giving it a shot with starting over from the beginning now on a single tab.,its been 24 hours that ive been trying to claim this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
redeem button wasn't doing anything for me either.,"i never got the ref 002 error, but what finally worked for me was removing the connection from [battle.net](https://battle.net) account settings and starting over.","when i finally got back to the page that was supposed to have the redeem button, it said the game was added to my account.","so it seems like one of my previous attempts to redeem ""worked"" but didn't actually.",not sure if this will help you or not... the way they did this seems unnecessarily complicated and totally broken on multiple levels.,good luck!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yes, it's ridiculous a company this big seemingly can't handle this.",they could've been able to see how many keys were needed beforehand.,"and besides, the lack of communication on their side is also really bad",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"of course they don't care, they are capitalists.",only interested in their own profit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean it will be fixed eventually.,waiting a day or two is not worth $60 imo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you really couldn't wait a day or so?,they're working on fixing it less than an hour after you edited your comment.,couldn't be me flushing $60 down the drain for some cod game,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
me too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i can buy the code from you if you get the game (i am serious),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

did you just keep refreshing or what?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
u gonna have to contact intel they are flagging accounts that they think have not bought the product themselves they will not let us redeem the keys unless we really bought the intel product from selected retailer if u dont have evidence forget about it money is lost.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
contact intel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sounds like you never intended to keep it and did it for the free game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
agreed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

of course there wouldn't have been a problem they would still have codes.,the fact they said to wait till the 28th and the codes come out on the 27th is fucked imo.,i got on the website 5 min after midnight and there all gone.,edit: i want midnight fucking releases again.,why is everything digital its stupid especially with drm.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thank you for the response.,will keep an eye on your site.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i get to the bundle expires screen and mw2 doesnt pop up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
get to a bundle expires screen that shows fhe mw2 button.,then smash that bad boy for 20 tabs and keep the ones that actually load into the cod page,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so basically duplicate the tab where mw2 pops up?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as long all my program and games works exactly the same way and with same performance as the x86 equivalent.,sure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not with that attitude, no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,"eventually windows on arm will takeoff, but switching prematurely would just hand the x86 market to amd, and no one is that dumb.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no because windows on arm is garbage currently, and has been since inception.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hell no.,there is no way in 2 years we will have full support for everything i do on an arm processor.,also i donâ€™t see a benefit.,x86 still outperforms but with higher power consumption.,i want that.,arm is good for battery things,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"unless software magically accommodates the architecture change, then no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my answer would be no even if on paper windows fixed it's arm compatibility.,i'm not a fan of being a gen 1 tester.,if arm ended up being their direction i'd give it a year to let others be the real world beta testers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, but giant if's are needed.","1. if developers embraced the change and there was arm versions of everything, like games too, and i mean any game that mattered, from big to little.",2. if the performance or power usage was massively better to make the transition worth it.,"i suspect #1 is not likely without #2, and i just don't think #2 is going to be worth it.","x86 is gross on paper, but the trade-off for having it is smaller than most people realize it.","most people ascribe the poor heat and power use of x86 hardware to the isa, but its really more like intel has been way behind on process for so long, and is so obsessed with raw cpu performance, that its more about slow, progress on process nodes and culture than the isa is the problem.","while i would love an elegant isa on paper, it may not be worth it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it wouldn't work without massive overhauling of windows with either really good x86-64 emulation or make windows run natively with arm without emulation.,this is why early versions of ryzen were trash compared to something like 8th gen intel.,emulation sucks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would research it for sure.,"lots of work needed on the dev side and they fully submit the x86 market to amd, so basically impossible odds of an instant full swap.","imo, better odds of addition types of cores first, but will be interesting to follow.","when the major os finally have per core/thread is figured out, imagine weâ€™ll see avx come back immediately and potentially a new line with arm cores or more likely risc-v.

potentially a lower volume dev device initially to test the waters.","though, i canâ€™t imagine itâ€™s funded before intel margins recover.","2025 asic would already be quite established, so the core concept of your question is already know by some :p",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
games shouldn't play themselves.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also arm is great specific for systems programmed and built around that specific chip.,thatâ€™s why appleâ€™s stuff is so damned good.,you gotta have it in an ecosystem like that to have such good optimization.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this would actually mean something if the entire market wasn't down.,intel stock is currently down 50% ytd with nvidia down 56% and amd down 60%.,all of the chip makers were hyper inflated coming out of the pandemic so a market correction was inevitable eventually.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
up in aftermarket there.,weâ€™ll see if it holds tomorrow.,basically the financials were decently better than analysts predicted.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"on consumer side, intel is not doing that bad.","it is just that they need those sapphire rapids out already for servers and also their ambitious plans for new fabs, meanwhile trying to keep paying 4% dividends.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s the io die.,that uses relatively constant 20w of power.,the zen2 cores itself can go to almost zero at idle.,intel doesnâ€™t have io die and the whole package can go to almost zero at idle.,iâ€™m updating from 3950x to 13700k this weekend.,iâ€™ll look at the system power differences.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

node shrink doesn't automatically make things use less power.,the problem with io die absolutely is that it cannot power down.,if it could power down you could build it in 65nm and it wouldn't have high idle power consumption.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you are correct, it's the gmi links eating the power.","you can make them sleep and power gate, but enabling any overclocking features, even xmp, can cause that to stop and wildly increase power usage at idle.","i can get my 7950x system (monitors included) to idle at 100w, ~20w lower than my 5950x... but then it pulls 340w+ under load from the wall.... or i can configure it to only pull 280~300w under load with a performance gain, but idle power is 120~135w because the gmi links and fabric stop sleeping.","interestingly, preventing linux from scheduling anything on the second ccd saves a good ~8w at idle as well, so that seems to be the gmi power draw... which is quite high and something amd needs to address... as well as allowing the fabric to down clock and sleep despite overclocking settings being active.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

> node shrink doesn't automatically make things use less power.,"true but we know that going from 12nm to 7nm, resulted in a fairly good power reduction from the silica.","look up the amd 2000 to 3000 series, where they have gone from 12nm to 7nm.",but that is mostly semantics.,"intel also has io into its monolith chip, that cannot power down and they are stuck on 10nm/7n.","if that is comparable to tsmc 7nm, why is switching a cpu and mb resulting in a clear 30w+ reduction in idle power.",probably because of that combination of io + communication + chiplets + chipset differences.,"anyway, all i can do is report what i am seeing.","same os, same wall power meter, etc, just mb, cpu and psu.","and that intel really kicks behind on the idle power usage, for my system upgrade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

do you mean 30w from wall power or soc reported power in hw-info?,30w soc from software reading is indeed not normal and something is preventing your cpu from idling down.,mine out of the box correctly idled down to 2-3w.,"maybe your power profile is set to performance, instead of balanced?","or you have software that is constantly pegging the cpu running in the background (virus, bad software, etc).",can be 101 things and google is your friend as you try and narrow the issue down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what node update typically does (in addition to being able to use more transistors) is allow similar clock speed with lower voltage.,that affects the power consumption when the silicon is working.,"however there might be side effects such as higher leakage power when going to smaller transistors, which might actually result in higher power consumption in low intensity workloads (the whole ""race to sleep"" concept was invented because last gen planar transistors leaked so much).",this is why you can't say that node upgrade automatically makes all power consumption smaller.,for idle power consumption the sleep states and power gating will actually always be more relevant than voltage curves because actual idle by definition only has leakage power consumption.,the chip that can do more power gating uses less power on idle regardless of which node it's being produced on.,"i would guess that the problem with the io die is related to cache coherency between the chiplets, which would necessitate constant communication if even one core does anything.",but that's just a guess.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i didnâ€™t find my power meter so i donâ€™t have system power measurements.,cpu idle power went down from 28-35w on 3950x to 15-16w on 13700k.,the process wasnâ€™t seamless.,i had to reinstall windows because the new setup would crash immediately on the old windows install.,and then i had to use another computer to download drivers to get the network adapter working.,but after that everything seems to work.,the 13700k does a bit over 30000 points in cinebench23 at 240w and around 29000 points at 200w.,2080 points single thread.,everything certainly feels a bit faster.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i mean hw-info.,"indeed, i had windows power plan set to high performance mode.","i changed it to saving energy mode, and now i hit 12w at minimum, which is much better but still far from your result.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
awesome to hear thank you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so far, the drivers have not been an issue for me with amd.","every game runs good, no crashes, etc.",used to be way different like 5+ years ago.,"now intel is the new ""old amd"" in regard to drivers (ref to their arc gpus).",*lol*,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you do not need to set it to minimum, just balanced.","take in account 12w after windows startup is normal, because windows spends sometimes 5 a 10min looking for update stuff (system.exe if i remember correctly) that keeps triggering hdd reads and cpu usage.","after that windows will calm down and your power usage will drop a lot on idle, to 2-3w when you're not doing anything like just reading.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"can't confirm that, with multiple monitor setups, there are still a lot of problems and bugs.","chrome hardware acceleration, stuttering and so on",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i was running at these settings for half a day, and it didn't drop.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, balanced is the best.","at power saving, my cinebench score fell dramatically, like 30%.","at balance i still hit 12w on idle, however my cinebench score is 5% lower, which is not a big deal because this cpu is plenty fast, but it is a minus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"better check your taskmanager to see if there is a task, that is constantly using like 1~3% cpu usage.",that tasks is probably preventing your cpu from going into lower power states.,can be something stupid like a game launcher like origin (known for pulling that stuff) or some rgb or other manufacture software.,"unfortunately, windows does not have very good control over the software unlike a mobile platform where such runaway tasks are automatically limited to save on battery life (and developers pay more attention on mobile platforms, on pc, anything goes).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

disabling all e cores is not a good idea.,"because you will need them in a cpu-intensive game like cyberpunk 2077 (8p core is not enough for 4k at 144hz), someone suggested i disable three e core in a cluster, so there is 4e core left, thus each e core has an individual 4mb l2 cache.","and i tried that, for cyberpunk, but it doesn't have any improvement at all, not even the 1% framerate.",the only improvement i noticed is the jump in 1% framerate when disabling hyperthreading because leaving it on will cause thermal throttling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

is this with the 13900k?,do you put adaptive vf point offset to -0.060v on all cores?,i want to try this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're oversimplifying how it works.,"it's not always going to use hyperthreading ""last"" like you're saying.","the operating system is generally a lot smarter than that with the way it allocates threads to cores, especially with intel thread director on windows 11 and linux.","also, hyperthreading is where the physical p-cores are split up in to two logical cores each, so if you're using p-cores with hyperthreading enabled then you're always using those hyperthreaded logical cores, it's not going to only use one hyperthreaded core and then use the second one after an e-core is used, that makes no sense and isn't how hyperthreading works.","hyperthreading is meant to allow threads to be allocated to each hyperthreaded core more quickly, that's all it is.",it's possible that performance and thermals may be better for certain workloads withough hyperthreading enabled (because you're basically slowing down the allocation of threads to the physical cores a bit) but overall system performance for most workloads will suffer by disabling it.,"if it works better for your workloads when it's disabled then great, just wanted to clear some things up about how that works.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yes, because some scene in the game (city centre of night city), is extremely cpu intensive.",also different games with different engine will behave differently.,so it does matter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

a 3x8 recently had problems too... look it up in /r/nvidia 's megathread.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"from what we currently know, [the culprit seems to be nvidiaâ€™s adapter](https://www.igorslab.de/en/adapter-of-the-gray-analyzed-nvidias-brand-hot-12vhpwr-adapter-with-built-in-breakpoint/).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is literally nothing wrong with the 12vhpwr connector.,3090 ti has been using it with no issues.,itâ€™s the adapters that are failing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sounds about right !,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what does ks mean,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
using an aio 360 for the cpu.,still canâ€™t run it without power limits without it throttling.,but by lowering the power load and undervolting iâ€™ve gotten it to run at 5.5ghz on all cores while keeping temps down.,still using the included adapter for the gpu.,iâ€™ve had no issues but will pick up a new cable eventually.,itâ€™s just a handful of people who most likely stuffed the card in too small of a case.,if it was hundreds or even dozens i would take the issue more seriously.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on what you consider normal heating.,direct electrical heating is very inefficient compared to using electricity to transfer the heat from outside into your home.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
perhaps he meant the hardware is expensive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no issues on your end so far ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"fair point, that one had slipped my mind sorry, but that particular issue is usually isolated to few titles and often is quickly resolved after they cook a card or two.",you're right it's probably not a bad idea as an extra precaution on any card.,with this whole adapter scenario unfolding i'd probably still take additional steps till we know how wide-spread it is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

correct.,in many games the difference between a 3060 and a 3090 is less than the difference between a 3090 and a 4090 in terms of fps.,"in some cases, the 4090 produces double the fps of a 3090. look it up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>	this attitude of always wanting more and better is destroying the world.,"i think it's fine in cases when people actually need it for their work, but the fact that some of these are just watching youtube for most of the time is the epitome of consumerism.","but i don't think this is the worst kind of buy, the fact that people have been buying $1000+ phones for years now is what sounds dumber to me.","at least with a 4090 you know you have the consumer top end, but the difference between an 800 euro and 1600 euro phone?","a really 'cool' finish on the metal and an extra camera, you're welcome.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"totally on your side, i really don't understand why everbody needs the new 4090 if they can just wait for the price to come down.","also it's not needed for gaming, because no monitor can really display this kind of fps, and even if one can, no one will see a difference.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
youâ€™re not wrong.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm with you too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that's why i'm rocking the r95900x and a 3090 bought last monthand my upgrade cycle is 3yrs.,my last pc was a laptop with a i7-10750h and a notebook 2070. i always go for 2nd from latest gen so i can save money and also not have to deal with early adopter bs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"none at all, installed the card in my phanteks p500 and did my best to hardly touch the cable lol.",made sure it's fully seated and that's it.,"honestly i don't want to check it until i have a replacement in hand, so until then i'll leave it alone and game like i usually do.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the best camera you can have is the one you have with you at all times.,not to say that everybody is making use of it but the picture you take depends on quality of the gear.,nowadays itâ€™s point and shoot and itâ€™s software that will do the 99%.,thatâ€™s a memory.,a picture you can frame.,"besides being the most used device by most owners, itâ€™s the personal computer in your pocket.",i do understand wanting more performance in your palm.,just sell/ pass/ trade in the previous item so someone else can make use of it instead of throwing it away.,pre pandemic you could buy cars for like 500 bucks.,what possibilities this opened compared to one peace of the puzzle of a pc is astonishing.,what you get with a phone compared to one part of a pc shouldnâ€™t be compared.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good idea!,best of luck ðÿ™ðÿ¾,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what setting from these would be the power limit you are referring to?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what's weird is when i put the 5 ghz in all cores and it does say that when i reboot in the bios it says 4.7 and also when i put 5 it gives me 500 mhz and only when i put 50 i get 5ghz but it i want to for example get 5.1 ghz and put like 55 i get nothing.,granted i'm using a b660 board which is probably why all of this is happening.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you realize, according to that screen, youâ€™re worrying about the time duration between the system running at 200 watts andâ€¦ 200 watts?",itâ€™s literally meaningless.,itâ€™s always at 200 watts.,just set your short and long term power limits to 4095 watts and call it a day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
honestly i am a complete noob with messing with the bios like this so i did not e even understand what you said could you please maybe simplify if possible.,my main issue is that whenever i try running cinebench r23 my cpu throttles to 3.6 ghz while in every other application it hits the 5ghz mark (its a 12700kf) when i increase the time duration to 128 as it was originally 56 i got a much better score in r23 and my cpu actually hits 4.7 before throttling again.,what would i need to change in the bios for the throttling to stop?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what are your temperatures during this test?,also your 12700k should run 4.7ghz on the p-cores and 3.6ghz on the e-cores if thereâ€™s no throttling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80c during the peak when it hits 4.7 and before i increased the time to 128 it would just be stuck to 3.6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"itâ€™s unlikely the time setting had a real effect there, as all itâ€™s doing is changing the duration between a 200 and 200 watt power limit.",soâ€¦ no change.,set those 200s on either side of the time duration to 4095 and see how your test goes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80 c on stock means dogshit contact between cooler coldplate and ihs.,"take the cooler off and see if you have don't have [paste distribution like that](https://i.imgur.com/ecsgbd2.jpg), but also make sure you don't actually run stock settings on 300 w power draw.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i actually got a lower score after doing that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to be honest, probably due to thermal throttling.","which means your issue isnâ€™t about being able to supply enough power, itâ€™s about cooling.",what are you using to measure temperature?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which is weird because when i play an actual game (cpu intensive ones at that) my cpu has no issue reaching the 4.7 speed and it stays at 59c the only issue is is cinebench.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,"for 12th gen, low to high:

u -> p -> h -> hx.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
u-suffix 12th generation cpus are available.,you'll find them mostly in thin-and-light or office laptops.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if you are going to go u series please get a 12th gen one as they also come with efficiency cores as well as performance cores so this means more battery life over previous gens,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

maybe you didn't get the best-binned chip for your 12900ks?,what is the difference in gaming?,i am more curious about that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but how?,"i did the same upgrade and at best it hits the same temps, and thatâ€™s with multi core enhancement on for the 12900ks and off for the 13900k",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"13900ks are good at the stock settings, but oc results on ocnet are disappointing, very few can even get 5.7 ghz all cores.","it looks like intel have binned these chips aggressively, saving all the best ones for the ks.","so for the first time, i'm going to buy a 13900ks this time around #waste of money.","also 13700k - 5.5 ghz all core at 1.23v stock, 13700k 5.5 all core oc needs over 1.3v.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
some are asking why 13900k and not 13600k or 13700k if just for gaming.,13900k has more of l2 and l3 cache than the other two.,this means the chip can benefit when it runs higher clocks.,"i have been saying this a while, that 13th gen secret weapon is 2x+ more of cache than 12th gen. the more cache you have the better performance scaling you get with higher clock speeds.",my 9900k gains no performance in gaming after 4.7ghz due to only 2mb of l2 cache.,"13900k has 32mb of l2 cache and that allows the chip spread its wings at high clock speeds, too bad it uses intel 7 process and not intel 4 process like the next chip from intel cuz it would be doing 7.4ghz and still benefiting from higher clock speed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
meanwhile on the other spectrum i have to disable e-cores to even get close to virtualization.,intel big little architecture still needs time to mature.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
those are great numbers.,iâ€™m on a 12900k and am holding out for the 13900ks which should be a cool beast if these numbers are any indication.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how is ram running?,any slight stutter in games?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
more performance and less heat than the 12900ks?,"they weren't kidding when they said that raptor is made on an improved intel 7 process, huh?","didn't quite understand what they meant by ""improved channel mobility"" but if this is the result, i wonder why they didn't just brand it as intel 6.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why it seems most people are ok with bare minimum hardware?,pc gaming is expensive to begin with so i feel like if you not ready then donâ€™t get one.,but i started my first gaming pc off with a 5900x 12 core especially when you see setups struggling with 8 cores i just donâ€™t get why ppl donâ€™t upgrade according to how you game iâ€™m hardcore so i make sure i future proof my setup so i soundly have to change much i see people still using a 2080 super n stuff like what are yâ€™all doing lol.,just upgrade you wonâ€™t have to later,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"> 420 + 360 + d5 custom liquid cooling

of course if you can cool it sufficiently, it'll perform well.",the issue is that not many people have the money or experience to install/buy and maintain a custom liquid cooler.,i do think that future gen processors should focus on heat and efficiency.,the sole reason i skip the 13900k is because my system can't deal with the heat it dissipates and won't get its best performance because of that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"check out der bauer, he tuned the 13900k power consumption to as low as 63w!!!","and lost only about 5% performance this is crazy  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4bm0wr6oeq&t=818s",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"stock, higher wattage and not that muxh more efficient.","but with a little tweaking it  consumes less and hardly looses any performance from stock, at all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"doubtful, it (the 12900ks) was throttling on only a few cores, i remounted it, read a lot of reviews and feedback, and it simply throttles for a lot of people almost irrespective of the cooling solution.","it's not constant throttling, it's temporary, but that's not what i want to see.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"12th gen had a lot of uneven contact, i read.",my own 12700k has some cores that frequently went 8-10â°c higher than the coldest ones on 100% cpu stress tests.,"and this was ""normal"" after multiple reseats.","it doesn't bother me because it never reached throttling temperatures at 5ghz all-core, but the delta is there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's probably not going to happen.,the reason i went with the 13900k is the 12900ks was just too difficult to cool.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"12900ks vs 12900k is basicly the same, but the former is pushed harder to perform slightly better.",13900k is already pushed to the wall.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm going to be buying one of those now because the 13900k oc results are all bad, no one has yet hit 5.8 all core, and 5.7 all core is rare.",but only a 12600k to compare to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe.,if rumors are true it will at least beat whatever amd has at present.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sorry but 11800h was better than 5800h, and lets not even talk about 12700h vs 5800h...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mobile cpus will have inbuilt dlvr.,that should help with efficiency.,let us wait and see.,that said intel seem to focus on getting mtl mobile chips out soon.,so rpl-p/u will have shortest window in a while.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's a little bit snappier in the windows 11 ui.,i ran a few benchmarks and the 13900k is beating scores i have seen published by a few websites.,"chrome tests, 7 zip compression, etc.",all higher.,"i'm running out of box config, not ""without power limits.""",gaming i was seeing over 600 fps in certain scenes of a game i play often.,the 12900ks was about on par with a 5800x3d and would see around 430fps in the same scenes.,"this is not scientific, haven't had enough time to run any serious comparisons.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
msi z690 carbon ek x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same... and i only use a 280 aio,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no it's post 3dmark firestrike extreme run comparing the same machine with different processors.,the funny thing is i have a 3080 added to the same custom loop this time around.,"in other words, the 12900ks had the loop all to itself.",the prior config had the gpu on air cooling.,"edit: added ""firestrike""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's less heat.,"the cores don't get as hot, i am not thermal throttling like i was with the 12900ks, and yet it's faster + more efficiency cores.","no it doesn't use 300w all the time, not sure where you got that idea.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol stop believing the clickbait headlines..   no one runs cinebench 24/7.,that 300w is basically just running a stress test.,you won't see anywhere close to that in games or typical workloads.,by that metric my 9900k would be a 190w cpu as it hits that running cinebench.,but most games it uses between 45-80w.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
example: https://imgur.com/gallery/otapa90,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think my experience was most people's experience.,12900ks is already a best binned 12900k.,gaming i haven't done a lot of yet.,played a game last night at 1440p and saw a 150-200fps improvement at very low settings in certain scenes.,overall it was +50 fps higher.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"who knows, maybe it is a golden chip.","all i know is it is way better than 12900ks for my own configuration, and my own use case.",it does not thermal throttle for my usage.,i am not going to try prime95 to force it because that is not something i'd ever come close to reproducing in actual day to day usage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ok, but i'm not at all comparing my results to anyone's oc results, nor my own.","as far as binning chips, mine seems so good i do not care about chasing a better one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is a little out of touch.,most people donâ€™t need 12900k or a 13900k.,"i5s are mid tier and are fine, especially from 10th gen on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is that a question for me?,i am not sure if you are asking something or just making a generalized statement.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
god damn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s only in lightly threaded tasks.,try cinebench and youâ€™ll see the score drop like a rock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
does this would work with a 13700k too?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are using the anti bend frame i hope?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
howâ€™s the 12900ks more difficult to cool if the 13900k has more cores to cool?,from all the launch day benchmarks showed everyoneâ€™s 360mm aio hitting 100c+ & pulling more watts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes someone has, look up bang4buckpcgamer, he hit 5.8 all core, although that is a little unfair since while he isnâ€™t using ln2 he is using external radiators",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just hope that performance doesn't compromise battery life on both sides.,on previous gens like my 11th gen i9 gets sub 2 hour battery life regularly because the cpu is trying to run at 5ghz all the time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe at 2x/3x the power usage.,but my friends 6900h absolutely trounces my 11950h.,"using less power it gets around 10,000 cpu points in 3d mark, while my cpu can't get more than 8,500. and post heatsoak and throttling his cpu still gets 10k points while i'm at around half the performance.",plus on top of that he can actually get more than 2 hours of battery life doing the same load as me.,"at best i can get 4 hours, and typically i get closer to 1. but he'll get almost 8 under the same usage.","13th gen can fix that, but only if intel keeps their clock speeds at bay.",i don't need 5ghz to browse the web.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nice, just bought the msi meg ace, had enough of asus i cba with anything they make at this point",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that definitely would be lower temps.,i have a 12900k with the opportunity for a free upgrade to a 13900k wondering if i will get lower ambient temps and more empower efficiency,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
core not getting hot =/= less heat.,more power=more heat.,yes i know it does not use 300w all the time.,i meant generally it should use more power than 12900k.,though ks might be more inefficient.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no one is saying it uses 300w all the time, but doing the same multithreaded applications, it does use more power than 12900k(s).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"even in games it uses around 80-100 watts, right?",dar8auer tested it.,"also, why o you need 13900k for gaming tho?",desont 13700k/13600k makes more sense?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just because the only thing you do is gaming, doesn't mean that people isn't running multithreaded applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what were you doing for the system to.consume 276 watts?,"i play games, and the total.system consumes around 400-500 watts.","and also, it should run hotter than 12900k.",maybe not ks tho.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hmmm... well if it is at low settings, i am not sure if thats saying much?",especially at 1440p.,do you have red dead 2?,i would be interested to see if there is any difference in that game at 1440p?,or cyberpunk since that game does favor more cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what are your 3dmark cpu scores?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm just comparing them to decide on which to buy, not bothered about the scores.","someone got 6.0 all core on a 13900kf at 1.28v, no 13900k is coming anywhere close to that, indicating any k chip that could oc that much is being saved for the stupid priced ks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the guy suggesting they are more aggressively binning is full of it.,iâ€™ve got the new i9 as well and this shit does not match any of the reviews about heat.,dramatically cooler than my 5950x.,i run at stock with asus mce off on a maximus hero z790.,love it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i know that but games are becoming more demanding they either cpu bound or you bound i feel like if you want pc gaming but at the same rate as console you better off with console games are better optimized for console.,but if you chose pc then why not crank it up so you donâ€™t have to be worried about upgrading.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just a in general but iâ€™m with dude who started this post iâ€™m going to upgrade my cpu to the new ryzen 9 7950x from my ryzen9 5900x.,i wonâ€™t have to upgrade for a while if i donâ€™t want too.,i donâ€™t really have to upgrade now but i even notice some of the limits of the ryzen 9 5900x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"he lost only 9% in gaming while using only 65w, who cares about cinebench",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it should, just donwclock the e cores & undervolt it + set a max power usage like 150w",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on mobo and how you do ur settings.,"asus mobos with mce on by default tend to use a lot more power than others (just as an example), since it completely unlocks the chip",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"360 must not be enough, i'm on a custom loop.",it was the exact same loop and with only the cpu on it with the 12900ks.,had same experience as everyone else with the 12900ks.,13900ks on same loop \*with a gpu added to it\* is running cooler.,"better benchmarks in cinebench r23, chrome etc than what i am seeing online.","wish i knew, maybe it's a nice chip.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13900k runs at higher clocks on less voltage thats why.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
try using intel xtu to lower the boost tdp to 35w.,"otherwise, head to your power plan advanced options and cap the maximum cpu power or performance at 85%.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we are not talking about zen3+....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my point was that you might normally expect lower cpu temps with the gpu on air cooling after running 3dmark firestrike extreme (which has a cpu physics mode and a balanced mode which uses both cpu and gpu as part of its run.),the 13900k is cooler \*with\* the gpu in the loop than the 12900ks was without it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lmao it is less heat.,"you can play semantic games all day long, i don't give a shit.",it is easier for me to cool \*with the same cooling loop\* with a \*gpu\* added to the loop (was on air before.,do not care.,it's faster and cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's does.,the extra e cores on the 13900k over the 13700k is pretty much pointless for gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, it does consume below 100w",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13900k has alot more of l2 and l3 cache than the other two.,this means the chip can benefit when it runs higher clocks.,"i have been saying this a while, that 13th gen secret weapon is 2x+ more of cache than 12th gen. the more cache you have the better performance scaling you get with higher clock speeds.",my 9900k gains no performance in gaming after 4.7ghz due to only 2mb of l2 cache.,"13900k has 32mb of l2 cache and that allows the chip spread its wings at high clock speeds, too bad it uses 10nm and not 5nm like the next chip from intel cuz it would be doing 7.4ghz and still benefiting from higher clock speed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its none of your concern on how people spend their money.,"personally, i dont need it but i can.",so why not?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh yah for sure i do video encoding frequently on my system which does load all cores...   but honestly if i get a 13th gen chip i'd just limit the cpu down to 150-175w in the bios for any long duration loads.,i really don't see any need to have a cpu going well over 200w for extended durations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's in the description of the photo..........,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"low settings means the cpu is doing more work than the gpu, so yeah, it says something.",even at 1440p (it's mostly game dependent.),"as i've said in other replies, i haven't had time to do a lot of gaming on the system as of yet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that doesn't make a lot of sense unless they are only turning chips with \*bad\* igpus into 13900kfs.,they would need to have a lot of bad igpus to satisfy demand.,it seems more logical they are simply disabling the igpu on a lot of the inventory.,"when you take that into account, it would be absurd to disable the igpu on a ""golden"" cpu that could be turned into a 13900ks...which is what they're saying they have.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"''who cares about cinebench'' people that are actualy buying the 13900k since it's aimed for workloads and creation, if you are buying this for games instead of a 13600k/f, inc. locked chips then you are wasting money.",if you drop wattage to 65w or even 90w+ you lose lot of multi-core performance thus whole reason for buying the 13900k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then why even get a 13900k?,just get a 13600k or the non k and power limit that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't be silly.,nobody in their right mind would ever buy a 32 thread chip to play a bunch of lightly threaded games not to mention less cores = higher overclock thanks to lower heat/power.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gamers nexus disabled all those settings & was still getting 50w more power draw on the 13900k vs 12900k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"then i'm loosing a ton of performance when i need it, and i'm still not getting good battery life.","i've found a nice balance is to cap the clock speed at 3.2ghz, but i still get worse battery life than an amd system.","apple has it perfect, and i get 10+ hours on my m1 mbp no matter what i do short of playing games.","amd is pretty good, but intel is just awful.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s fine because his laptop is actually a 5900hs.,"itâ€™s the newer version of his laptop with 6000.

regardless, this is a multi generational issue where (especially higher end) intel laptop cpus struggle to get good battery life in real world use cases.",ever since 3000 series amd laptops have been getting great performance per watt.,"and in real life workloads theyâ€™re getting twice or 3x the battery life of intel machines, which is what matters most in laptops.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep.,100 watts looks correct.,"also, as he said, low 60 does not mean the heat is 60. it still putting the same heat/more heat than a 12900k/amd equivalent, because those should consume less power.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gaming in general is a terrible power consumption test.,neither zen4 nor raptor lake uses much power in gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

had similar issues with an alder lake i5.,windows 11 wasnt giving good battery life at all and the chip was configured to run 80 watt boost for 2 minutes at a time.,xtu was buggy and the adjusted tdp wouldn't save.,limiting the cpu power / frequency only affected e cores.,"i had to use a registry hack to disable ""modern standby"" to get the og power saver power plan working and that caps the tdp to a more reasonable 45 watts boost or so.","stock, i was getting about 3 hours battery life.",this was an **intel evo** model so it should have had all day battery life.,"with these tweaks, i stretched it to around 7 hours.",also disabled hyper threading because there's absolutely no reason to have that extra multi-threaded performance on a 12 core (4+8) mobile chip for web browsing.,"intel should target lower multi core peak frequencies more aggressively, because they already have so many e cores, it's not necessary for all cores to boost so high during an all core workload.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you might be better off setting power limits vs undervolting?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"undervolting, or overclocking will void the warranty on intel, amd and nvidia.","just be reasonable, and if it dies (extremely unlikely) then dont bring it up.",cpus are incredibly rare to fail outside of the factory though.,"also before trying to warranty it, obviously return it to stock and see if it runs, there is no guarantee any chip will run at settings other than stock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not sure how the warranty works today, but back in 2016 my first 5820k died after using the asus overclock features on an x99 board.",i told intel i used it when i filed a claim and they sent me a refurbished replacement anyways.,ymmv?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
doing anything other than running stock technically voids warranty.,the only question is: how honest are you?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"in the past there's been cases where intel has asked for diagnostic data, only to deny a rma because the diagnostic data showed that the user had xmp on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
step 2: great success,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
right so make sure you disable xmp too and run at the supported speed only when submitting those results.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you should run windows 11 as windows 10 will run very poor on your particular cpu.,"for the rest you can undervolt it, but for cpuâ€™s, that is quite complicated.","for the rest, all you can do is set your windows power plan to power saving.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
go into your bios and set an appropriate fan curve.,on my 12700k for instance i have all fans off except for one (set to 25%) anytime the cpu is under 45 c. then gradually turn on more as it heats up.,works great and the system is dead quiet unless i start doing heavy processing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
set a 90 watt power limit in bios and set the fan speed curve to a flat 50%,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no offense but you bought the wrong cpu.,"get a 12100f or 12400f, itâ€™s 58w or 65w and $100 or $200 and it will be silent on your u12s.",and the kicker is you wonâ€™t notice a speed difference with your workload.,"at stock 13700k can boost to over 200w, itâ€™s going to throttle pretty fast on a single  tower/fan noctua.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"""efficient"" :d",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nothing is efficient if you pull it past the intended power envelope.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they're not efficient even in stock operation, they're literally less efficient than p core in terms perf/power draw.","e-cores are intel's brute force to keep up with heavy multithreaded performance while still being coolable, they're supplementary cores that should have remained in smartphones application.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"chips and cheese tested p vs e efficiency at different clockspeed:

https://chipsandcheese.com/2022/01/28/alder-lakes-power-efficiency-a-complicated-picture/

they found that the e cores were more efficient below about 3-3.5 ghz.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they're on the same power plane as the p-cores so their operating point depends on the p-core voltages.,you could clock them separately but that's a waste - they're getting fed the same voltage anyways so you should clock them as high as they'd go at p-core turbo voltages.,"the seething about e-cores stopped making sense on 13th gen. you can clock the ring to 50x with them enabled, 16x of them are almost as fast as a 3950x for mt work, and per thread they're as fast or faster than using a hyperthread on a p-core.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which is pretty much ultrabooks and mobile gear territory or heavily underclocked desktop/laptop.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well yeah, they're made for light background tasks, not high performance, so the optimal operating point is at lower clockspeed.",once you need higher performance you use the performance cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"except you know, there's sixteen of them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you give e cores too little credit.,"for background tasks, just 2 e cores can do the job, as they are the equivalent of a 9700 core.","&#x200b;

the point of so many e cores is so that the multi thread performance is increased on their limited monolithic die.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol they are not.,they are made for multithreaded applications.,a single e core could run all background task by itself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they're really not, hence the high efficiency at light load.","you can use them for things other than what they're designed for though, and they won't necessarily be bad at them, just not ideal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
load doesn't dictate efficiency.,if it was for background loads another p core would be even more efficient.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, ram cannot damage processors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
higher frequency can only be unstable.,the only thing that can damage the cpu/memory controller is higher voltage that one might use to make the higher frequency stable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it will damage your wallet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so when you xmp the ram set the voltage regulator on the ram in bios to +/- .1 vdc of the listed spec.,"it should obtain its rated speed per jdec standards if it's marked at 6400@ cl xx timing@ 1.xx vdc 

this should be automatic if you applied xmp profile.",as it's reading the profile directly of the dimms,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bring out the gimp!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am sure it can.,if you throw a stick of ram onto the pad side of the cpu it would damage it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
okey thanks!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ram cannot.,excessive system agent voltage can.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah okey, i will keep an eye out if it is unstable.",will not increase voltage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"most motherboards will raise vccsa to compensate for stability, but do it a little more than what is needed.","doing 1.15v would be plenty for 6400mhz on vccsa, but most boards will auto to 1.3v which is the highest most people should ever daily.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so i turned on xmp to reach 6400mhz, so does that mean i do not have to touch the voltage regulator?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't do this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"probably you will need not only not increase voltages, but decrease them, long time till now some voltages can set in auto higher than long term save values.","especially if use more ram, double especially if use more speed + more capacity and extremely - if use two kits with high speed big capacity.","system agent, memory controlled and cpu almost always overvolted from the box in auto.","so in some ""especially"" situations you must adjust that 3 voltages.",and probably play with latency or and frequency.,more voltage value not always mean more stability.,"some time that's mean black screen with no way to open bios, till recheck ram stick one by one.",and after that check that voltages:) so better do that before.,in my case z390 ace set voltage of sa and mc 1.35+ for both.,"about 3 years, till mention problem force me to check memory.","and after i was calmed all sticks are stay good, same as memory controller.",i drop that voltages to normal manual set something about 1.18 1.2 for ddr4.,32gb 3600  cl15 two kits.,"for ddr5 at z790 or similar depend of speed, capacity and stick's quantity save and stable minimum can be not same or much more than just not same... so i think we have to ask about that voltages for our cpu... not about frequency",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same they do with vcore and memory controller.,both of them need to be dropped down with system agent voltage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the ram will be running at the lable specs on the dimms you shouldn't need to touch anything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also you can use a 3rd party software program like cpuz or hardware info to verify this.,"[https://www.hwinfo.com/download/](https://www.hwinfo.com/download/)

if you use one kit in recommended slots you have not to change anything in that situation.,but in ideal case better check voltages.,"some time they can be set overvolted and then you will need to slow down some values... some voltages can heating slow some components and that way to couple variants - damage one or more system's component, lost stability, works with errors, full stop working system with black screen, but with everything still physically good.","last one some time is best, because for some people, idiots like me as example, the only way to rewatch voltage politic, and stay with gain without pain",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

fix the things you know you can control.,"i know it is work, but reseat and paste the cooler, then you know for sure.","the bios and mei i was talking about affect stability and can affect scores, but will not cause those heat issues you have.",yeah the average is lower because it calculates the low idle times into that max temp.,"&#x200b;

why are you using passmark?,"it's bs utility, 9900k beats 11400 absolutely everywhere, even the locked sku does.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"letâ€™s not talk about the 12400f thatâ€™s just 20% slower than the 11900k, or the 12600k that destroys every previous cpu (except the 10980xe in multicore performance thatâ€™s just 25% faster having double the threads",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tbf if not for the renewed competition in the cpu space we'd still be stuck with i7 quad cores at this point ðÿ™ƒ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

on the mainboards driver page try installing the latest intel me driver.,might be some updated mainboard drivers there also.,me driver might fix the boost clock issue.,win 11 100% cpu usage might be a more common bug?,can try googling it.,seems like a windows issue or a driver issue?,malware or an overclocking testing program?,google max processor state and see where that setting is located.,there's a max and min setting.,minimum get set to 100% some how?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nope nothing at all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i had already tried the max processor state, and the minimum was already on 0, tried reduces the max to see if it done anything.",it didnâ€™t!,"but something i have noticed, if i change to power savings the cpu usage goes to 77% and is hard locked on that and if i change back to balanced it goes to 100% again",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ll try the drivers and stuff will have to go and get myself a usb though.,"iâ€™ve tried factory resets so i wouldâ€™ve hoped that would eliminate any virus or malware issues, nothing has ever come up on scans thatâ€™s iâ€™ve done.",iâ€™ve read a couple of forums with similar issues to mine and tried all the suggestions in those  but no luck,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"going to try the cmos suggestion now, see how it goes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">in one of the biggest ipos of the year, intel corp.'s self-driving technology unit sold 41 million shares at $21 a piece, according toâ reutersâ andâ bloomberg.","that gave the israel-based company an initial market capitalization of about $16.7 billion, which was still lower than initially anticipated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
doesnâ€™t this take value away from intel investors?,you would think they should have issued shares to investors upon ipo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"afaik, intel always plans to keep their majority stake at the company.","unfortunately, they will use all the funding to pay dividends to their shareholders instead of financing their fab investment plans.","to be honest, as an intel investor, i don't care much about mobileye.",i think it is more frustrating the deal that intel made with brookfield for fabs.,"of course, it is good to access to financing and share the risks but also gives up a big part of opportunity that comes with future fabs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is what i was expecting as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

entire mobileye would $160-$320 billion, 10x-50x what intel paid for mobileye.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it just seems like they are taking growth potential/expected value of the company away from the investors.,i personally would have preferred to see 5% distributed as fractional shares to shareholders who can decide to sell or keep.,then they can sell an additional 5% at the market decided value if they are this strapped for cashâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

where are you getting this idea?","""the ipo values mobileye at $16.7 billion, a far cry from the $50 billion valuation that intel was initially hoping to achieve.","mobileye is selling only a 5% stake in itself, less than the typical 10% to 20% stake for most ipos.","this limits the financial hit it will take as a result of its lower valuation.""",- https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/intel-unit-mobileye-prices-ipo-above-range-raise-861-mln-source-2022-10-25/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lmfao what,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the idea is that you can sell your intel shares and buy some mobileeye if you desire it.,"ultimately, there is no reason to force existing owners of intel to have mobileeye shares that would trigger a taxable event in the event of a sale.",the important thing here is that you neither loose any value either way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you seen the intel stock lately?,itâ€™s lost plenty.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> have you seen the intel stock lately?,itâ€™s lost plenty.,i have and i own shares in intel and been buying more and more.,the stock drop doesn't have anything to do with the mobileye ipo.,"the idea is if intel gave stock to shareholders, they now are valued less and that will reflect in stock prices.","if they held a large share of it, then intel's stock price will reflect that value as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"set the power limits to something reasonable like 250w (or less, even the best aio will throttle around sustained 250w) and see if it can keep it under 100c.",this is highly unlikely that any normal load will make the cpu temps hit so high.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> or is this scenario of pushing the cpu this hard quite uncommon?,do you ever do anything that pushes it like that or just benchmarks?,if you're just gaming on it then there is no need to change the cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i actually found out that in order to manually set the p1 and p2 i just have to click and type it in haha.,so i set the values specified in the article of a p1 of 125w and p2 of 253w.,i went back and started aida64 stability test again.,at first it spiked up at 100c which triggered a 6% throttling but then it stabilized and i'm currently running 100% cpu usage at core speed of 4500 mhz at 65c\~.,is this to be expected?,"since the max boost is 5.8 ghz, would an aio achieve an even higher clock speed with similar temps?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's what i thought.,the capping of p1 and p2 made a big difference in terms of the temp vs. performance.,but it's been quite a while since i have been building and tweaking computers i was not fully sure if the situation had changed.,"i did a check with novabench and my performance had increased 1023% since my last build back from 2013 (cpu,mobo, memory) but still with my gfx from 2016. ðÿ˜",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
direct die on a custom loop with 2x 360mm radiators could probably handle an unlimited tdp 13900k lmao.,"based on my experience with a d15, i wouldn't really trust it to handle anything more than 200w sustained load.",my 10900k hits ~84c at 200w.,try setting a pl2 of 190w and see how your chip handles that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it might, but not even a full custom loop can keep that processor under 100c in a stress test if you are just feeding it high voltage and 250+ watts of power.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hi , no , keep the 11400 is overall 20 % faster than 10400 , is a bit hotter but is ok , you should check the temps if you are using the stock cooler and  maybe you should buy a cheap tower coleer but same if you are using the 10400",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks everyone, i will stick with the 11400 f.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok. my pc was i5 6500. and now iam planning to buy new pc.,isnt the cpu wont be max 300watts all the time?,"(only on max load like stress testing or productions)

and idle or small usage like 30 watts?","and gaming  is also wont push them to max watts?,

thanks",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes the i7 13700k with the power limits removed may reach 300w in all core workload , not if you are gaming ,but yes if you are buying a high end cpu like that buy a good cooler and a good power supply",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"keep it, i have the same cpu and power consumption is nice for the gaming performance.","relative to the whole system, the power consumption is alright.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 11400 is by far the superior cpu.,"if your concern is the electrical cost of running it, or the heat output, first remember that it only uses power/produces heat when itâ€™s working.","if youâ€™re sitting idle on the desktop or surfing the web, itâ€™s barely doing anything.","but second, you can always set power limits to prevent it from working hard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this was not it for me.,i found out it was what is called in the intel xtu tool is called active core tuning.,itâ€™s purpose is to limit the max freq when multiple cores are active so that you can have a higher freq when only one or two are active.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

another setting that forces all core cpu boost is the high performance power plan for windows since it forces a 100% minimum cpu state",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just tried that and did nothing :'(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
set it to balanced.,in ~~max~~ high performance it will stay turboâ€™d at 5.5ghz.,edit: forgot the correct name of the profile.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well that's your problem..  max performance will peg your cpu at the highest clock speeds all the time.,you need to use balanced mode if you want dynamic clock speed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"is the ""minimum processor state"" on your active plan a value other than 100%?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
use hwinfo64,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yes, because the igpu is disabled!",nothing to do with the cpu cores,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so that was only one of the reasons.,are speedstep and c-states enabled in efi?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you tried more than 1 program to verify the issue is that the clock speeds are stuck at 5.5 and not that the program is faulty?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you changed the minimum from 20% to 100% that's the cause of the cpu not downclocking.,set the plan to balanced and reset its settings.,this will rule out anything power plan related and see if it fixes this behavior.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

while undervolting my 12900k greatly improved my temperature at maximum load.,the whole package power idles at 4w and gaming maxes out well under 100w.,undevolting cooled things down a bit at the very highest of loads such as benchmarks and rendering while keeping near full performance.,"generally i found it far better to leave the undevolting alone, and use the power limits instead, where a cooler and more efficient system is desired for intermittent heavy loads.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"1. yeah, i don't use vms or wsl (i usually prefer to have linux in dual boot).",i'll try to explore a bit more if i can undervolt both cpu and gpu since they share the same heatsink.,2. the fan noise on my laptop is an issue because lenovo configured it to be almost always on and there's no place to configure it.,"only when temps are really really low that the fan stays off 

3. but the offset voltage affects all the clock speeds / states?",idk but i have the impression that it only affects when in heavy load providing less voltage to the processor.,"i mean, when idle the processor probably gets enough voltage even when we undervolt but it is under load that it requires more voltage.",does that make any sense?,thanks again!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"software adjustable power limits are a feature of newer generations, in windows power management you could limit the cpu maximum processor state at the cost of performance to cool things down.","in some laptops the thermal paste can dry out and loose contact with flexing of the system chassis, leaving a less than ideal thermal transfer to the existing heatpipes.","re-pasting the cpu may help some, and good chance to check for other issues.",undervolting will certainly help with older systems if you can adjust the values.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

damn can i have ur 4090?,iâ€™ll trade you for a 2070 super def a good deal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when the cpu is too good for the game and doesnâ€™t get used,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"its destiny 2 man, its horribly optimized for high end hardware, and as a 4090 user aswell it just doesnt play well.","i get stutters and low usage, i dont know about you tho",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i guess so lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my gpu rpm speed is somehow always at 0 in nvidia performance overlay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looking forward to dlss 3.0 at 4k!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"at that price, it is better be one!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m assuming the gpu is being bottlenecked by the cpu?,it is pretty crazy to see 1% in death stranding o.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have the exact same issue with my ryzen cpu and the amd gpu drivers haha.,"usually i only have like 1+2% of useage, when i get like 15 it shows 5, when its at 50% i get maybe 20% in the overlay.",are these overlays so hard to make accurately?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks, iâ€™ll try it out!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my task manager has been bugged like that.,would show 1 percent gpu but other apps would read different,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
:edit he meant fan speed lol im shot yeah it is a bug admonish me i deserved the downvotes for that i noticed this within the last month or so it is a bug idk if its fixed yet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i hope so, cyberpunk hovers around 7%, testing will be conducted ðÿ¥¸",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the laggggg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
say it ainâ€™t soooo!,lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm a pc and windows 11 was my idea,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you are probably right, but letâ€™s say it is hovering around 7-10 percent, isnâ€™t cpuâ€™s on average be around 40-50% load when gaming?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
destiny 2 lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i guess iâ€™ll have to try itâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i read about that so i agree.,still posted it though to get some thoughts on it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
â€œhello darkness my old friendâ€,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you are correct lol, destiny is one my favorite games although it can get boring real quick haha.","i am also having issues with cyberpunk as well though, i assume it can be a bug with the overlay so iâ€™m going to download msiâ€™s at some point today.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"according to our fellow reddit squad, itâ€™s a bug due to windows!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am in the latest patch.,thanks for that!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hahahaha big facts lollll,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the only thing i can think of is you are pressing alt+r on your keyboard?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"itâ€™s destiny 2, map is banner fall ðÿ˜ž",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bruh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i heard itâ€™s the new windows update messing up overlays.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
press alt+r,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't bother and use afterburner's.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you can also use the auto tuner oc, raise power etc., via  alt+z",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"same, i just find it odd because youtubers have the same specs yet they are getting 40-50 cpu usageâ€¦",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 latest msi afterburner monitors cpu usage correctly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is that bad?,ðÿ˜¶,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not a big tech dude so im not sure.,itâ€™s destiny 2 so the game isnâ€™t considered demanding as most modern games i assume.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sorry, i decided to upgrade bruh",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"while you are correct in a way it's not destiny 2 it's just a glitch via the overlay as for destiny 2 it is a bad game in terms of optimization but that's due to the devs using an old engine and a jungle of messed up code 

besides that it does run great the majority of the time and i'm on an i7 6700k with an rtx 2070 that gets over 100-130 fps at 2560x1440p with most settings low and textures and such at max (the game actually looks so amazing still) 

with an rtx 4090 and i9 12900k i think destiny will run great maxed out easily so something must be up on your end",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
didnâ€™t notice that hahahahah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just watch dlss 3.0 doesnt increase fps in the same sense as normal fps.,"because it makes its own fake frames, it increases input latency which can make the game feel worse than playing at a lower real frame rate 

hardeare unboxxed made a good video explaining and showing the effect
https://www.youtube.com/watch?=gkuagmyg5lw

the link isnâ€™t working for my phoneâ€¦ the video is called â€œfake frames or big gains?",- nvidia dlss 3 analyzedâ€,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if the gpu was being bottlenecked by the cpu you would see 100% cpu usage and less than 100% gpu usage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my pc shows that i only use 7-9% cpu usage in cyberpunk 2077. gpu is at 99% but that low of cpu usage i thought was odd.,glad iâ€™m not the only one with numbers like this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"same man, new 7950x will show 0-3% utilization while task manager and hwinfo show much higher and more accurate utilization.",was fine when on my 5800x build so thinking the new chips haven't been ironed out yet for geforce possibly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"lmfao, how is it not?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's a bug with 22h2 if i'm not mistaken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is.,if running 22h2 microsoft changed how certain parameters are read.,cpu usage being one of them.,compare that to say performance manager within task manager or msi afterburner 4.6.5 beta 2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's surprising.,what kind of fps are you getting?,i play competitively at 1080p just curious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, then it might be the overlay thatâ€™s the problem, altough just know you wont be anle to use afterburner readings on destiny because of the battleeye anti cheat.",that might interfere with it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i tried to press those two keys and got nothing.,weird!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
donâ€™t know if i should be impressed or asking the amount of hours you have,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thats gigachad pc power,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what resolution do you play on?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hmmmm i wish you took the the trade because clearly the 2070 is better than the 4090 donâ€™t look that up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great for sims tho ðÿ¥¹ðÿ›«ðÿžï¸,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that is a good video and shows if you arenâ€™t already getting 120 fps without dlss 3, donâ€™t turn it on because the input lag will be unbearable.",i canâ€™t see the point to dlss 3. old versions had some benefit for multiplayer games at least,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why would making up frames increase input latency?,"if anything time clicking on â€œspaceâ€ should jump the same speed, regardless of fps",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"dlss 3 on plagues tale is amazing, as it is a bit more slow paced, the gains are huge for 4k, easy 120min fps with all max settings.",flight sim has excellent case for dlss3 as well.,"fast paced games like spiderman, not so good.","with time i am sure they will improve on how smart the 'fake' frame will appear, and hopefully they share some of that tech with the 30 series.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you wouldnâ€™t necessarily see 100% cpu usage.,even at 30% it can be a cpu bottleneck.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks for the info, still learning about bottlenecks!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i tried using hwinfo, did not see the cpu usage, i guess i have to upgrade to the latest version of it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i get 3% usage while gaming too, with the same specs, its just poor optimization",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it says 236fps on the fps counter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you have the nvidia overlay enabled?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4k plusâ€¦ but the game has been out for quite some time ðÿ˜…,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank yew ðÿ˜,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i play on 1440p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"maybe not for a driving sim, you need a lot of fast inputs for those with corners and stuff.",hub does mention flight sim being good because itâ€™s a lot of sitting around and static screen with smaller button presses,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"dlss 2 is amazing tech

dlss 1 is vaseline while dlss 3 is forgery

hopefully this 4 brings it back",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"because there is a ""fake"" 1.5 frame being added between real 1 and 2 frame, that uses part of your old frame movement and ai to reconstruct a new frame.","the new frame is not representative always of where your movement is, and latency for true movement is delayed.",it's great for single story mode games though...would not use it in a fps game,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to make an intra-frame based on the previous frame and the current frame, you need to be one frame behind.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thatâ€™s why i didnâ€™t poopoo dlss 3, just warned about being overly enthusiastic",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i got hyped by the new intel release, and started testing some of my own stuff.","in cyberpunk my cpu is at 90% and my gpu is at 17-18, it bounces between those two.",iâ€™m guessing iâ€™m cpu bottlenecked if thatâ€™s my read of the situation on task manager.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah a lot of people don't understand this and think a cpu bottleneck only happens at high utilization but that's incorrect.,it completely depends on the cpu's core/thread count and how many the game can utilize.,for example a 5950x has 16cores/32 threads but most games only utilize maybe 6-8 of them there for you have all those left over threads barely doing anything so your total utilization % is low.,but those 8 threads that are being utilized aren't fast enough to compute frames to the gpu compared to say the same 8 threads on a 13900k that are much faster.,aka you're bottlenecked.,that's why you need to look at both your cpu and gpu utilization to get a better idea of where your bottleneck is coming from.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"https://pc-builds.com/bottleneck-calculator/

have fun!",they still haven't got the 13th gen and 4090 on the list ._.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
poor optimization?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""amateur"" fits alright.","gf experience is garbage monitoring tool, just like standalone hwmonitor.","want stuff reported correctly, you use hwinfo and rivatuner with msi afterburner.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the game overlay was on in geforce experience.,i turned it off and it isn't coming on any more.,i think that solved the issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i get that but i didnâ€™t see/feel any issues with mine.,not sure what the lag is for dlss3 but i canâ€™t see anything other 50ms making a major difference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, thatâ€™ a cpu bottleneck.",gpu should be basically maxed out in cyberpunk.,download msi afterburner and check the usage there instead.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what cpu do you use?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that bottleneck calculator is bullshit btw and isn't indicative of how actual bottlenecking works.,the information and calculations it produces are a joke lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"mate, i use msi afterburner and gpu tweak 3 lmao, i never said i used geforce experience.",reporting of issues with destiny 2 performance on high end hardware is common knowledge for the people that got some technical knowledge and dont live under a rock.,amateur is just to get people like you to respond.,"the game he took a screenshot in is destiny 2, which is why this would have made sense as a game issue.","in this case it might have been a gf issue, but its not uncommon for this game to use abnormally low resources with stuttering and frame drops",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thereâ€™s so many factors to be fair, from frame rate to response times (both you and the monitor) and the input latency and your sensitivity to it.","i was mainly hoping to more caution people about dlss3, instead of say itâ€™s bad or critique it directly

we also have no idea what itâ€™ll be like on the weaker 40 series cards or 30 series if it gets released.","new tech only shown at best case scenario can look great, but who knows about not perfect environments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i7-6850k with a rtx 2070 super.,i noticed my memory was capped out at 15/16 basically my entire play through.,"the fucked up part, is i really have no issues.","the game runs great at 50-60 fps, and looks perfectly fine.",i hardly notice any graphical lag or issues at all.,"so if it wasn't for the hype and my emotions, i'd be perfectly fine just doing what i'm doing, and would have never felt a need to upgrade anything.","another issue that's gnawing at me is that my computer doesn't qualify for windows 11, so i've just been debating on replacing the cpu/mobo, and getting ddr5 ram, so i'm caught up with the trend.","and then i'd probably get 32 gigs this time, since it appears i've capped out at 16.  


finally, i haven't built a computer in well over 5 years, so part of me is just itching to get back into it, lol!",i think i'll have to bide my time and do more research.,maybe black friday will have some good sales,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is there an accurate one out there?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"don't use both simultaneously, issues magnet.",i've no stutter at all with 11400f and regular 3050 nor 12700k and 3080 ti.,"if you want actual cpu usage then use core usage, not stupid averaged value.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not that i know of.,your best bet if you want to know if a system will have a bottleneck or not is to just look up reviews for the specific component you're curious about and see their actual performance relative to the other component your worried about bottlenecking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i dont use them at once obviously, and i got core temp to see core usage.","low tier cpu with high tier gpu worked well for me, upgrading made it worse as said, cant be gpu as ive tested 3 different 4090s and 4 3080s alongside a few 12th gens to see issues, tested multiple computers and it varies between parts but usually issues with intel and nvidia pairs.",its just bungies shit way of making their game,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wrong sub, try r/whinning or intel support.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
faulty igpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you can't even get into windows then do a fresh install and don't bother installing drivers for the igpu, you don't need them, just get the latest drivers for your gtx 1060 and you're good to go.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you're using a dgpu you need to install those drivers instead,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can disable the igpu in bios,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
re-seat the cpu might be a good thing to test?,there is a lot of pins relying on good connections.,tiny bit of figerprint or dust could potentially cause such issues with a bit of resistance on a critical pin.,generally it appears like corrupted memory data.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"when i try and plug my monitor into my gpu the os freezes and corrupts, is this a related issue?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"will give this a go, will have to install latest drivers for gpu offline as otherwise the display drivers install automatically",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i will try and do that but when the monitor is plugged into my gtx 1060 it doesn't boot, freezes the os",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that should be standard practice regardless.,"always use, if possible, a usb stick to bring drivers over to the fresh install while network is disabled.",i can't tell you how many times auto-driver installations have caused people major headaches over the years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe reinstall windows with the igpu disabled?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yep, i even tried installing display drivers offline and it still caused the same issue",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"or boot in safe mode , remove the intel drivers and install the nvida driver , the thing is you should be able to have both gpu installed , so am not sure what is wrong here",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for the dgpu or the igpu?,it's possible you have a faulty igpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think that is the case as well, have sent intel a support request so hopefully it can be replaced under warranty.",will let everyone know what the issue was / is if i ever find out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i installed drivers for dgpu offline and they worked perfectly, i then switched on my internet and it installed the intel display drivers which, when hdmi plugged into dgpu caused the entire os to corrupt, and when plugged into the igpu causes that static",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea this definitely sounds like an igpu issue.,hopefully you get a good response from intel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"first, thatâ€™s complete and utter bs on so many technical fronts.","second, intel tried an embedded serial number with the pentium iii, and there was such outrage they removed it before even moving into the p4.","see:

i don't think that is true.,that sort of anti theft would have to be implemented in an os.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"a lot of the comments here talk about it being feasibly impossible without booting into the os, but they probably aren't aware that [intel me is an embedded microcontroller](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000008927/software/chipset-software.html) present on [all?",intel cpus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intel_management_engine) which has its own os and runs independently of whether the computer is turned on or off.,its able to use the internet too so this type of thing is possible on paper.,"however, this type of remote management isn't available on consumer cpus, and is only available on [vpro](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/228439/intel-core-i912950hx-processor-30m-cache-up-to-5-00-ghz/specifications.html) and xeons via [intel amt](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/intel-active-management-technology.html) (which runs on the me).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sounds like bullshit to me.,"actually, i know it's bullshit, because in any home network setup, your pc gets a local ip address from dhcp on your router/modem (whatever device you have that handles dhcp).","this local ip (192.168.x.x) will then be nat'd to your carriers public ip *by your carrier modem*, which is the ip that does have some geolocation features but generally not enough to get an address of it.","because it's handled by the modem, your cpu would never know what the public ip on your modem is, that's being handled by a different device.","there's literally no way for your cpu in your computer to ever know what your carrier public ip is.... so the only ip address they would get, even if this was true, is your 192.168.x.x local ip which is of no use to anyone.",you can check this by going into your windows command line and typing ipconfig.,you'll see your local ip address.,"you can then go to and ip address lookup like what is my ip and that will tell you your carrier public ip, which you will see is much different than your local ip.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if the intel management engine can get on the network via dhcp and wired connection, it could do a rest call to an external web service which gets the public ip the same way your website example does.",the public ip isnâ€™t necessarily useful to determine an address though.,most folks get dynamic ips for their home connections.,itâ€™s highly unlikely this is implemented but itâ€™s possible to get an ip address provided the intel me os has appropriate capabilities.,not to mention that some bios have network capability for updates so no need to be in windows for that part.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'm not sure your 12700k is the problem here.,"a cpu bottleneck would in the worst-case scenario give you a 0% improvement in averages and maybe a bit worse 0.1 and 1% lows due to the game using few cores/threads and maxing them out when switching from the 3090 to the 4090, not an average loss of 20 fps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why?,"i have the same cpu mobo and cooler as him, i downclocked to 4.8 and temps are like in 60s on load havenâ€™t spent time fine tuning


@ op can you please share how much vcore you are using for 5.2ghz

game stable at 5.19 here on a 360 aio,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not really.,that seems more of a downgrade/sidestep for what i am doing.,also have been reading some horror stories with amd in the simracing community with vr issues as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because for triple 1440p in the titles i use some still need more gpu power to achieve the framerstes and graphical settings i want.,especially in vr on my g2 to get it to look good in some titles as well.,it has benefited all of my titles tremendously with framerate limitations i had when running my 3090 except for this one title in monitor mode.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol you clearly have no idea what triple 1440p is.,"its 7680x1440 not 2560x1440, there is a massive difference.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
start at about 5:15mins.,hes getting great results with a 7950x and stated (in a different post) 13900k is performing better in this title.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mf9pgjpcnic&t=329s,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i ended up going with a 13900k and put it in my setup without changing anything else.,i am still testing.,obviously benchmarks are way better and i am benching at or above what you see on the internet.,"as far as raw performance, some titles i use with my triple monitors are not optimized well and still see cpu bottlenecks.",i did get small gains but nothing to brag about.,"but again, this is due to the type of games i play which is outside of your normal fps shooters, rpgs etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean you simply changed your gpu and left everything the same.,your cpu has not changed at all and it worked just fine previously.,you have no issues with most games.,there is something wrong with how your new gpu is responding to this particular game.,this might simply be an issue with the game in regards to the new gpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i don't know what the cause could be i'm afraid, this post is the first time i even heard of the game and i'm not familiar with its ""quirks"".",however the 12700k is not the problem here and buying a 13900k is not the solution.,the single core performance between the two is negligible enough that without an fps counter you wouldn't be able to tell which one you're running.,and then there is [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8v3kcspsow) guy with an 11900k who got a \~40% increase in performance when switching from a 3080 to a 4090.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you should at least go into the bios and set it to gear 1 with vccsa set to 1.2v

gear 2 ddr4 might explain some of your lag",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think it's something to do with that game in particular.,check their forums as well and good luck.,"i personally wouldn't upgrade unless you go all the way with new mobo, ddr5 and like a 13700k and definitely not for 1 game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not really, its just games arent really things that can go very wide.",the cost of synchronization between threads makes it not really worth it for every little thing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because 12700kâ€™s are 12900kâ€™s that canâ€™t overclock to specification.,"a really good 12700k might do 5.1. 

not saying 5.2 is impossible but running unstable clocks can hurt performance, thatâ€™s why i asked",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am running a 1.40v override in bios.,1.385 vcore when gaming with this game with temps around 55-60\*c. llc5 asus z690 tuf mobo.,5.2 all core p cores and 4.0 all core e cores.,disabling e cores gives me a 5-8fps bump in this title.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
game stable isnâ€™t stable lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how does cpu affecting vr?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but you're still leaving behind around 20-30% of the performance because of cpu bottleneck.,the 4080 would have been a much better buy for 1440p.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and yet he still gets cpu bottlenecked in certain games?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks.,"i have 12700k and am seeing bottlenecks with 4090 and 4080. i was hoping 13900k would be much better, but i think i'm going to wait for zen 4 3d vcache.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes and i believe the issue is due to the games optimizations causing a cpu bottleneck.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i get the same results with the same settings as that video.,which is pretty poor.,"but i typically do not run those settings, my normal setup is a bit less taxxing.",but look at his utilization.,less wattage and less usage on the 4090 vs the 3080 indicating a cpu bottleneck.,"also, he only has a few cars in view, when sitting on grid with 20 cars its much more cpu intensive.","but my results to this video using these settings are very similar

2 of the bigger simrace youtubers have had drastically different results but their testing was done with a 13900k and 7950x.","no 13700k or ddr4 testing, which is why i am here asking....

dansuzukis hot lap meaning, no other cars on the track.",is averaging 221fps @ 7680x1440p- this is with a 7950x/6000mhz ddr5.,"he has tweeted in this sim, the 13900k is actually performing better.",i am getting no where near that on a hotlap.,"if you want to see his video, start around the 5min mark he talks about triple 1440s performance.","[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mf9pgjpcnic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mf9pgjpcnic)

so is the 12700k my problem?",i think so.,but my concern is back to my questions above.,will a 13700k or 13900k with my combo now get me there?,or do i need to do to a ddr5 setup to do it?,if the difference in fps is 5fps going ddr5 with a 13900 vs ddr4 then i dont care and i will stick with ddr4.,"but we are talking 100+ fps difference......unfortunately, i have seen no testing with a 13700k, or a 13700k/13900k ddr4 combo, which brings me here for advice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks.,i will check that tonight.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so i just checked.,not familiar with ram stuff but i do not see anything that says gear 1 etc.,"i do see ""dram command rate"" this is an asus mobo.","its set to auto and my other options are 1n, 2n, 3n or n:1. i am assuming this is what i need

thanks",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,i believe its optimizations within the game as how its known to be heavy on single core.,"the thing is, this is my main title i play.",i have a dedicated simracing rig and play this 75% of the time.,i dont mind the upgrade if its warrantes.,its just if i can get away with a cpu swap imstead of going new mobo/ddr5 i would rsther take that path.,i made a post on the forum as well.,"however since the cpu is only a few days old, not much testing has come out.",the big youtubers that have tested it are running 13900k or 7950x with highend ddr5 etc.,they are getting better results naturally.,but no solid test on ddr4 to compare and no tests with 13700k yet.,id like to save $$ if i can.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah yeah yeah.,"there are so many concurrent problems, errors, and optimizing to be done.",usually not worth the effort.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its been running @5.2 stable all cores since i ocd it in feb. i did remove the oc for testing purposes and did not gain any performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it is if thatâ€™s what the machine is intended to do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
vr in this particular title is working very well.,in iracing mirrors and dynamic shadows affect the cpu heavily.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes iracing with max settings and 59 ai or massive online grid will most likely be cpu limited.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what are you playing and what resolution?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"tl;dr. get a 13th gen if you want, but thereâ€™s something else nvidia / iracing should be aware of / hopefully already have the fix.","fundamentally, the constants wouldnâ€™t make sense to target.","if ( n - 20 ) fps was the cpu bottleneck, you wouldnâ€™t see n fps with inferior hardware; you would only see ( n - ~20 ) in both configurations.",nvidia drivers or iracing optimizations would be the initial target.,did you clean install the nvidia drivers?,platform updates could help but it would be unusual if everything improves and only one takes steps backwards.,"if you havenâ€™t already, itâ€™s definitely worth opening support posts with nvidia and iracing.","you can absolutely get a 13*00k if youâ€™d like, but whatever is going on should persist through the cpu change.",( n - ~20 + b ) will be your result unless the issue happens to resolve in parallel.,~relative value as it would be proportional instead of flat (unless itâ€™s a software fps limiter),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i'm not sure if i should get the 13600 or 13900, i have a 4090 fe.",i've looked at every review and it seems the 13600 is a beast but just not sure if it will bottleneck the gpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have 12700k, which the 13600k beats ðÿ˜œ i use it for gaming, video editing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if youâ€™re a gamer, the 5600 and/or 12400f are still the way to go for cpus.","the 30 series is also still grossly overpriced right now, if youâ€™re buying new iâ€™d buy an rx 6000 gpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i7 ages much better than i5.,"even if you need not the extra performance today, i7 will be worth the extra cash in 3 years.","and if you decide to upgrade motherboard in say 3 years, you will easily sell i7 for good money.",while i3 or even i5 will be worth near nothing by then.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
definitely.,i7 is even better then las gens i9 which is still wicked powerful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eol socket.,7600x with upgrade to 8800x3d in 2 years would yeald more.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if you get the right one they're great.,some of the issues with them are poor power delivery.,i have a msi b560m mortar with an 11400f and it's great.,unlocked the power limits and get 4.2ghz all core clock with no power drops and a steady 65c temp with air cooling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"some are bad, but b560m mortar is good",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i want to buy a pc with a msi b560m pro wich was specifically listed as one of the worser b560 boards, the worser one was the asrock one as you couldn't tweak any power limit.",as i'm getting the msi one i'm wondering if the board isn't the issue and i could manually change the power limit and maybe it'll still be fine?,and if you could give me a tutorial or something showing how to change power settings of msi motherboard that'll be grate.,thanks for responding btw,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its not so much the settings on the board it's the components on the motherboard which limit the performance.,watch this hardware unboxed video for some comparisons.,https://youtu.be/hkita0xvxum,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(sorry for asking so much) the motherboard (b560m pro) didn't seem to struggle with the i5-11400f temps and it ran it at 4.2ghz.,is there anything else i should check to see if it would be a problem to run a 11400f with that specific board?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nope the 11400f is pretty easy to run and should be golden if you can unlock power limits.,also make sure to enable xmp for your ram.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
impressive cpu score boost!,"not much change elsewhere, as expected, but the 12700 was unlikely to have been a bottleneck before.",what kind of r23 scores are you getting?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is this the best way to test performance before and after?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what if that is ddr4 systems vs ddr5 systems?,fast ddr5 can make that gap happen as we are on ddr5-8000 oc speeds now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cinebench is not significantly affected by memory speed - certainly not to the degree of a nearly 15% gap in raw cpu performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"can confirm, i get \~30700 pretty consistently with ddr4-3600.",probably thermal/power throttling in those results variances.,"my chip wanted 255w at stock (on an msi board, so possibly higher stock ac load line than some other boards).","this caused me to throttle and get 28k on a d15, which is pretty similar to a 240 aio.",after an undervolt i'm at \~215w and 90c package temp in cinebench.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, itâ€™s almost certainly power or thermal throttling that isnâ€™t getting caught.","there have even been issues with a bug in xtu where setting any power limits (with it instead of bios) simultaneously added a frequency cap, which resulted in some wild outlier reviews.","27255: https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/intel-core-i7-13700k-review

the nh-u12a is actually superior to the nh-d15.,the nf-a12x25 fans have serious air movement and the nh-u12a has a larger cold plate.,i would go for the nh-u12a if you want the best air cooled option.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'm going to be building a new air cooled rig soon so i was genuinely curious about this.,"i looked up about 20 other reviews and at best i found at low wattage the two match temps, and in high powered scenarios (anandtech tested up to 340w) the nh-d15 is far better at cooling compared to the nh-u12a.","i'm not trying to knock that reviewer or the nh-u12a, but it's clearly an outlier.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"we aren't talking about fans, we're talking about heatsinks.",notice how i'm not using the stock fans that come with my heatsink either?,i'm using arctic p12 pwm pst fans because they have higher static pressure than the stock ones.,you could put those same a12x25 fans on a nh-d15 for better performance if you want.,"the u12a was made to have similar performance to a d15 at a much lower volume, so it's easier to work around the motherboard.",it's not a better cooler.,"take a nh-d15, spend $15 on a couple arctic p12 fans and it performs better than a u12a all day at a lower cost.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
those heatsinks come with fans last time i checked.,sort of necessary to have.,one has the most superior static pressure fan on the market.,the other comes with larger yet inferior fans.,"the fact that a single tower heatsink that's smaller and has ""less surface area"" yet can keep up with or better the nh-d15 in most cases says quite a bit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

those would be the only reasons... yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think derbauer said the next two gens will take the same ilm frames.,derbauer frame might not contact the mainboard at all vs other frames?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thats a typical marketing answer.,it is not preventing it from hitting boosting frequencies under what cooler?,"most of the processors dont even come with a coolerâ€¦ 

also, independent testing shows that major improvements can be made by installing a contact frame.",does it work without?,yes.,does that make a contact frame bullshit?,absolutely not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
otherwise they would be admitting to putting out a product that lacks fit and finish.,sure it's good enough to hit the target frequency but if overclock bench tests are better with the bracket then they shouldn't be discouraging anyone who buys a k chip from maximizing it's potential.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"'needed', no reviewers are using frames for their reviews.","and it only benefits people with flat cold plates, which is a minority of the cooler market.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's needed only if you want to overclock.. the ~5â°c drop gives you oc headroom.,more extreme solution for this is direct die cooling.,otherwise if you run it at intel recommened stock settings (power limit) and on capable cooler (dual tower for i7/9) it works just fine without the bracket.,it'll be at 90-95â°c but that's fine because 12/13 gen temperature temperature target is 100â°c (if you're under that it means your cpu will not throttle and runs within design spec).,"come on, cpu isn't made from butter or soft plastic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are your temperatures under 100â°c when cpu is fully loaded?,if yes then you don't need the frame since you won't get any performance improvement.,"and if you are thinking about cpu health then even if you're super lucky and the frame decreases your temperature by 10â°c (for most ppl it's <5â°c), those 10â°c don't make any significant difference on the cpus lifespan.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™ve got 4 of these adapters, i kept ordering from ali express and they werenâ€™t showing up over the course of a few months, then suddenly all 4 showed up within a week",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"its really up to you, its not a particularly hard install.",but you should definitely be slow and cautious to do it correctly.,"you may see big temp improvements or may not, so if you feel like your temps are high and need some improvement you can go for it, done properly it won't make anything worse at least.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"what i wanted to say is if intel change something to bending, itâ€™s likely to be for meteor lake that will receive more changes initially",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"by the same logic, intel should be selling direct die because it can net 5-10c improvement.",stock settings are a non issue in any cooler capable of dissipating the 250w tdp of the chips.,the ilm is really not a problem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they did suggest tweaking the llc and getting a more capable cooler if heat is a problem.,they did not admit the contract frame is a necessary solution,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
even if you are not overclocking keeping your cpu cooler has multiple benefits.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what about the bending part?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> ""  it'll be at 90-95â°c but that's fine because 12/13 gen temperature   
temperature target is 100â°

what a nonsense, it's never fine to run a cpu at 95c, stop repeating others like a mindless parrot.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, i will use a cheap b660 ddr4 board as a mid-term solution, so one one hand i will probably won't need it, on the other hand it would make sense to try on this one.",thanks!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and amd should also be selling ryzen 7000 without ihs, that gives close to 20â°c temperature decrease - the ihs is thick that's why it's such a big difference.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which ones?,these cpus don't care about running above 90â°c as long as it's below 100â°c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is fine... many laptops are running their cpu under load between 90-100â°c for years already  and zero problems.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you canâ€™t put in a 9700k or 9900k.,different motherboard.,donâ€™t waste the money.,grab a ddr4 z690 and a 13600k and get a massive upgrade and reuse your old ddr4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you actually can upgrade to 9900k with a modded z170 or z270.,this is what i did.,"regarding your question, the gains from 7700k to 9900k are insane because of the higher core count and thread count.",it cost me a 100$ difference to sell my 7700k and buy a 9900k and a few hours to learn to mod my msi z270 gaming titanium.,"if you're looking for an inexpensive upgrade for your pc, you should look into it!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
doable with a mod called coffeetime 0.99 btw (z170/z270),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the mod consists of a bios patch followed by a light pinmod on the cpu itself.,google coffeetime 0.99,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

also be carefull not to bend teh cables..might burn..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how you got the 4090 fe?,i check best buy the whole day and canâ€™t find it in stock!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1000w platinum psu with a native power cable.,not gonna touch the adapter.,and the 7000d case has plenty of room.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hoping cable mod can come up with a strong cable to use.,the melting is very troubling to read.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

me too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
used the same cable on my 3090 ti and no burn issues.,do not do silly bends while the connector is plugged in and make sure its connected properly and 99% of people won't have issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

do you plan to upgrade to i9-13900ks or will you stick to outdated hardware?,"i mean nice build, but on paper its already mid tier",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

its plenty lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you using the adapter though?,i am using the native one from corsair which is better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thank you for making great products, but i cant say the same for nvidia.. $1.5 for a connector cable failure, i foresee a recall coming.. how does your cable and adapter fix this issue though?","the problem is with the power adapter, the sockets are sharing the same thin solder, there not independent.. it's not a cable bend issue, the bending just breaks the solder, how does your cable solve this problem?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"https://twitter.com/capframex/status/1584833335951781891/photo/1

cables can be bad.",people can handle them wrong.,this issue is not exclusive to this current situation.,"imho, don't use the adapter or if you do, only for a short time until you get a proper psu provided cable.",many are giving them out for free.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks, i didn't know that corsair shipped a 12vhpwr cable with their psus.",i thought it was a separate purchase.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am using the adapter that came in the box with the 4090 with my corsair rm1000x psu.,i am waiting for the corsair 2vhpwr type-4 psu power cable to come back in stock or waiting for the cablemod 90 degree cable to get released.,"honestly though, i am still figuring out if i want to keep the 4090, its massive overkill and my gigabyte rtx 3090 gaming oc is still kickin ass.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nope it is not the issue with the people, it is with the quality of the products and its flexibility and compatibility where you ever install it, it should not have any kind of issues bending the cables or not, donâ€™t direct the subject on the consumers.","margin errors is there always with consumers, but it is not something new to highlight.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they don't yet.,i had to speak with their support and request it.,took a week to arrive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it boils down to if you plan to overclock the ram yourself.,"if not then get the best xmp profile you can afford, just don't overspend if the next one up costs too much more.",it overclocking you want to look for a kit that uses hynix chips and avoid 5200 because they mostly use micron.,ddr5 up to 6000 at stock xmp loses big time to tuned ddr4.,tuned 7000+ ddr5 can match and in some cases beat tuned ddr4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

also don't make the mistake of putting ddr4 with a non k please.,"the sa voltage is locked and many people, myself included, couldnt get 3600cl16 to work on a 12th gen non k.

that is not a small bottleneck lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

unless it is brand new production (ie.,"last couple months, and afaik thereâ€™s no way to check or verify that)â€¦ then yes, you will need a 12th gen as msi b660 boards lack the ability to upgrade bios without a cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most motherboards have small icsp connector for external bios programming onboard.,all you need is cheap usb programming dongle from aliexpress for $5 or so.,"and a laptop, or some computer to do the programming from.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's true, but i think your best option will be taking your mobo to the shop selling cpus or servicing computers.",they should do that within 30 minutes max.,your mobo doesn't have flash bios button at the back of io shield so you can't update your bios without cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sadly, almost no b660 boards has this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
some of those dongles have also an adapter that is pressed on the bios chip iirc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on the board.,90% yes but some may come from the factory with the newer bios.,sometimes oems will put a 13th gen ready sticker if they do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
majority will need flash except new ones produced recently.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"question 1: e-cores are used if you watch youtube videos or something, p-cores are used during gaming and heavier workloads 
question 2: if there are no e-cores it uses the p-cores for everything 
question 3: the difference between the 12400 and 12600k is that the 12600k has 4 e-cores
question 4: we don't know yet


i5-13600k vs 12600k is a pretty big difference in performance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1. e cores are there to increase multithreaded performance.,p cores are for strong single threaded performance.,2. nothing.,it just uses p cores like cpus has for the past forever.,3.,12600k will work better for heavy multitreaded stuff like rendering or gaming while streaming.,4.,13400 will be a rebranded 12600k.,u can try looking for 2nd hand 12600k going for ~200$.,the 13400 will be around that price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do i wait for the 13400f or just get 12400f?,or the ryzen 5600?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so will getting the 12400f now be bad?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"similar to op here, i'm about to upgrade my old i3570k to a new setup with the cheapest 12100k i can find!",have to upgrade for a job change and a new gpu is the important bit.,if the 13400 is 10-core or even 8(4p/4e) it'll be worth the wait and smaller loss reselling the 12100 in 2 months.,"for me the 12400 is 60% more cost and the 12100 lets me upgrade mobo/psu etc right now ðÿ‘
may even find a used 13600k in that time post black friday.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
neither of them.,get 13900k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not if you need a pc now.,"the 12400 (remember, f just means it has a disabled igpu) is an excellent cpu.","the 13400 naturally will be better, not sure what pricing will be, but if you donâ€™t need a new system for a couple months, it might pay to hold off.","but if you do need one now, waiting is hard, and remember you will always be able to upgrade to 13th gen down the road.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 13100 will be 4p/0e.,the 13400 will be 6p/4e.,the 13500/600 will be 6p/8e.,these are all on modified alder lake silicon.,the 13600k and higher are the only â€œtrueâ€ raptor lake parts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
will the lack of e-cores be a substantial loss in gaming and stuff?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not for gaming, no.","if youâ€™re trying to do a ton of other stuff while gaming (live streaming, playing youtube on another screen, etc) then they can help, but most hardcore gamers are happy to even disable e-cores entirely.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i see, thanks!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if i recall correctly, alder lake engineering samples have the pcie 5.0 lanes disabled, so you can only connect a gpu to the chipset, at pcie 4.0 x4 speeds.","theyâ€™re a particularly bad idea, even among the already well-known issues that es chips have in general.","it should, however, be functional on the board.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
alder lake engineering samples are locked to specific bios that are not available to production boards.,"trying to obtain an engineering sample is pointless, when the 13600k performance is near the same as the 12900k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is the only report of this i have seen anywhere.,it wouldn't make sense to me unless there's some bios settings not being applied properly once updated.,have any of you seen anything similar?,i just purchased this exact motherboard and a 13900k yesterday.,if nobody can confirm i will report back when my parts come in and i can do some testing myself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i5 is more than enough.,unless you enjoy counting an extra frame per second as a hobby,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would get the 13400f since the ipc gains in the 13600k over last gen are pretty big.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when will 13400f come out?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"but aren't 13400 based on adl die rather than rpl, so you wouldn't be getting any ipc gains?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there are still some gains to be had.,i would still go for the new gen since 12400f hasn't really gone down in price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's a 12600k with reduced/locked clocks.,"a ""proper"" 12400 if you will.",if you see a 12600k go on sale i would just get that as you might have to wait until january.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

anyone have thoughts on undervolting and/or power limiting the 12600kf for better efficiency like the 13900k?",so we've seen the 13900k essentially overclocked out of the box and that by reducing the power limit to even 85 tdp produces similar results specifically in gaming.,i'm looking to do the same thing for the 13700kf i just ordered but am not all that versed in cpu benchmarking/undervolting.,anyone have results to share?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have almost the same setup.,i have a i7 6700k and gtx 1080ti and itâ€˜s definitely not enough for playing newer titles in 1440p and vr.,i canâ€˜t even install win11 on this machine which is hilarious.,thought about upgrading to 13700k.,this would be a big performance bump but iâ€˜m also not sure about buying ddr5 ram.,on the one hand i want to upgrade to future tech but on the other ddr5 seems not to give any extra performance but is a lot more expensive.,but also if i stick to ddr4 and i take the old ram in the new system i would have to buy ddr4 version mainboard and completely blocking the possibility of upgrading ram later without buying a new mainboard.,kinda dilemma right now tbh.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">long story short if i decided to upgrade to a 13600kf or 13700kf and stick with my 1080ti for now, would i see any benefit or would it just be a big bottleneck still.",you would be shifting from a cpu to a gpu bottleneck.,but then you'd slam into a gpu bottleneck very quickly.,"that's because something a tier higher, the 8700k is all that's needed to extract most of the performance out of something like a 3070, which is \~30% faster than your 1080ti.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i would stick it out until january for the non k releases, the price to performance will be the 13400 i would bet.",because you are most likely looking at 6p and 4e cores.,"paired with a b660 motherboard, it will leave plenty in the savings for a gpu upgrade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah ditto, normally i would do a big purchase every 5-7 years of everything (cpu,mobo, ram, gpu etc) but its just insane now costs for mid-high end.","although i'm leaning towards keeping the ddr4 for a saving, because then it seems like the next step would be to upgrade the graphics card, and then in another few years ddr5 should probably be more mature and benefits for gaming might appear.",as apparently ddr4 vs ddr5 for gaming etc is negligible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i had the same dilemma going from a 7700k to a 13600k, and my solution is to carry over my current ddr4 kit and buy a cheap matx b660m-b board.","i can still tune the ram, but otherwise stock boost is enough on the 13600k.",then in two years or so i can pick up a discounted z board and a ddr5 kit and will unlock 30% extra performance.,"for now, i think i'll remain gpu bottlenecked even with a 3080.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

for photoshop there is generally relatively little difference between the two but it depends on what exactly you do.,it's also up to you if that difference is worth the ~$200 price difference.,">from the reviews, the 13900k is the fastest but also runs hotter: it reaches 100â°c and throttles after a few seconds.",this is a non issue.,it runs exactly as hot as you want it to run.,>there would be no point in getting the 13900k when it can't maintain high performance for more than a few seconds?,"nope, this is a complete misunderstanding of the thermals and power management of the cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

go 13700k with a fast ssd or two.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>it runs exactly as hot as you want it to run.,explain?,you don't want it to reach tjmax too fast and throttle.,>this is a complete misunderstanding of the thermals and power management of the cpu.,explain?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the cpu heat output is determined by the workload type and the power limits it follows.,the workload effectively determines how much it would like to draw and the power limits give the upper limit on how much it can draw.,photoshop is typically not a heavy all core workload that would approach the power limits.,the cpu should be able to run at maximum speed indefinitely in most things you would do in photoshop without any risk of approaching thermal limits.,power limits out of the box are determined by the motherboard.,"most of them do not set power limits, which is why people think these chips will hit thermal limits.",this is done mainly because motherboard manufacturers want to look good in benchmarks and lifting power limits gives them a few percent performance advantage in cinebench.,not using power limits is just stupid unless you are trying to reach record benchmark numbers.,the temperature of the chip depends on the heat output and the capacity of the cpu cooler.,you will never hit tjmax if you have big enough cooler.,what you have to do is to set the power limits according to the capabilities of your cpu cooler.,i would say you can easily set the limits to ~200w without losing much all core performance and without losing any performance on workloads that do not use all cores.,this would likely not affect photoshop at all.,at 200w most decent air coolers should be able to handle the cpu.,250w is approximately the limit for high end air coolers.,with liquid cooling you can go closer to 300w.,but going above 250w doesn't really increase performance significantly.,additionally there is the limited boost property.,you can set two power limits.,the definition of the limits is a bit complicated but short explanation of it is that pl2 determines the maximum peak power draw and pl1 determines the maximum average power draw.,in practice the cpu will be allowed pl2 temporarily as long as the average power consumption is still under pl1.,"the averaging computation is governed by a parameter called ""tau"" which determines how fast the average follows the current power consumption.",all of these parameters are user configurable.,what i would do for photoshop is set pl1 to 200w and pl2 to 250w with 28s tau.,this would allow shorter burst heavy workloads at full speed while keeping the cpu nice and cool with most coolers.,in any case the thermals of the cpu should not be the consideration when comparing 13900k and 13700k.,you can set the thermals to work exactly as you want and that wont really affect the difference between the two cpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you want the cpu to perform any calculations as fast as it can.,so you actually would like for it to reach tjmax if there is enough work for it to do.,after that it will still work as fast as it can.,faster than 13700k under the thermal limit.,you can however just power limit the card to whatever value you want to use.,"for your use cases, go with 13700k.",you will notice 0 difference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks.,what if i do things like encoding videos for a few hours at a time?,or using filters in photoshop continuously?,would there be a difference?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"quick look at benchmarks, 13900k is around 15% faster in handbrake x264 and x265 and around 30% faster in svt-hevc.",svt-av1 only shows 5% difference.,can't find anything about photoshop filters specifically.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"any intense multicore workload, such as rendering, where the cpu would be working for an extended period of time, would benefit from the 13900kâ€™s additional e-cores.",but that doesnâ€™t mean the 13700k is a poor choice!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as far as i have seen, the z790 boards have higher oc potential than the z690.",that being said i went for a z690 gaming f from asus seeing as my ddr5 runs at 6400 which is where the z690 seems to cap out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i cant answer this but i can tell you ddr5 @ 5200mhz on a rog strix z690-e with an i9-12900k is fast af boi so im assuming yeah you can push even faster with the 13900k and ddr5 for sure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i doubt it.,it doesn't make any sense for intel to build a better ddr4 controller than what 11th gen had because everyone seeking maximum performance will opt for ddr5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

these two are going to be very similar in performance.,the difference will be what applications you're using.,i know previous ryzen cpu's tend to prefer better cas ratings unless you're going to really high bandwidth rating differences.,the real question is what your motherboard supports?,"5600 would be default, and will have universal compatibility.",anything higher is considered overclocking.,the other question is how to best match the infinity fabric frequencies of this generation.,previous generations wouldn't like much above certain ratings.,that's why lower cas ratings was the best way to go.,ddr4 3600 c14 or 16 was pretty much the best.,everything above that wasn't much different because of that infinity fabric limitation.,you would have to have a really expensive motherboard to handle the really high frequencies.,"not always, but it wasn't usually stable past a certain overclock.","to answer the question, 5600 c28 would be the most stable while still being very fast.","i'm sure 6000 is fine on most, if not all am5 boards, but i'd instead look at the benchmarks for the type of games and programs you'll be wanting to run.","on intel, the playing field opens up quite a bit.",intel supports a much higher range of frequencies.,i've heard it said that amd likes lower cas ratings but intel likes higher bandwidth.,i would say that a very high frequency with a lower cas rating would obviously be the best.,there are lots of different ddr5 6400 c32 or 6600 c34 out there.,that would be better than either for intel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"well i'm planning to write an article on my reasoning as to ""why"" i'm switching, but to give you a few reasons off the top of my head, it competed at the $400 for me with the asus strix-f. i am a long time asus fan and ran their motherboard for more than a decade and i like their monitors, but the strix-f won mostly by default since it could be used with the lga1200 and 1700 lga coolers.","asus rog uefi is definitely top notch and i was able to reach some very nice overclocks, but i found msi bios to be more â€œhelpfulâ€ as it explained things a bit better and was more streamlined.",iâ€™ll still need to see how far i overclock my dram and cpu in msi uefi.,"making the switch to msi uefi\\bios will definitely be different, but i rarely go into the bios nowadays anyways.",overclocking isnâ€™t the most important reasoning for my pc build.,at $400 dollars i always felt that msi offered more bang for the buck.,the strix-f only has two pcie x16 slots (pcie-5.0 x16\\16 & pcie-3.0 x16 (running at x4).,on the other hand msi offers three pcie slots.,two pcie-5.0 x16\\x16 or x8\\x8 and a pcie-3.0 x16 (running at x4).,i really could use the lanes especially as i push towards possibly running a second gpu for various workloads and my current pcie devices could use more than a pcie 3.0 x16 that is only running @ x4.,"asus does include a pcie 3.0 x1 slot as well, but iâ€™ll rather have the extra pcie-5.0 x16 slot that msi offers at the same price.",you donâ€™t get two pcie 5.0 slots on an asus platform unless you spend an extra $300 (rog maximus z690 hero = $650 right now) depending on sales throughout the year.,the msi carbon is current about $350.00.,msi offers the led debug screen and asus doesn't.,at around $400 - $420 i thought that was great to include.,i expected a bit more bang for the buck from asus.,for overclocking msi carbon offers 18+1+1 phases (75amps) while asus strix-f offers 16+1 (70amps).,msi uses an 8 layered pcb while asus only used a 6 layered pcb i believe.,"i can feel the difference in weight, but iâ€™ll look more into this whenever i get around to writing the article.","both companies trade blows across difference areas of the motherboard, but i feel like the msi carbon will suit my needs in the future until i am ready to upgrade to a 14th gen cpu\\motherboard.",asus strix-f gives us access to four m.2 drives while msi allows us access to five m.2 drives.,asus does have a cmos reset button on the back which msi lacks since itâ€™s reserved for higher\\more expensive tiers so thatâ€™s a nice touch for asus to include at the price point.,"on the rear panel asus has 8 usb (type-a) ports and msi has 9. out of those 8 for asus four of them are only usb 3.2 gen 1, only two other ports are 3.2 gen 2 and the remaining two are usb 2.0. msi gives you 5 usb 3.2 gen 2 and remaining are usb 2.0. asus offers three â€˜type-câ€™ connections and two of them runs gen 2x2 (20gbps) while msi only offers two type c connections.","one of them runs gen 2x2 (20gbps) and the type-c other runs gen 2. slight win for asus, but when it comes to throughput i had more success from the msi carbon than i did with my current asus strix-f, but iâ€™ll need to retest everything now that it has been roughly a year.","when i finally decided to use the wi-fi antenna and bluetooth i get random disconnects and for my workloads and thatâ€™s just unacceptable, even if some of the workloads arenâ€™t extremely critical.",i expect a bit more from asus.,iâ€™ll need to check out the msi carbon wi-fi and bluetooth connectivity.,hopefully it isnâ€™t as buggy as my asus strix-f current setup.,"msi packaging feels more ""premium"" and gives you far more useful items to work with.","useful things like a usb for flashing bios, flathead and phillip screwdrivers, rgb led y extensions and extensions for corsair rgb and rainbow rgb led, and other stuff like the cleaning brush which is just a nice touch.",it feels more premium at the $400 range which is a decent amount to spend on a motherboard.,"this post is already longer than i wanted it to be, but thatâ€™s roughly my thoughts right now.","things could easily change once i start running the msi setup for a while, but the extra pcie 5.0 lanes will be nice to have.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

my thoughts about the z690 and z790 is that if you already own a z690 board just skip the z790.,the only benefits i can see is possibly better memory oc and a few other small improvements.,upgrading the z690 bios would be more beneficial and a bit cheaper.,"some z690 boards have dropped in price slightly, but thatâ€™s still a drop.",the higher model z690 boards are still pretty expensive as they use more premium material.,since you are upgrading to a 13th gen you have options.,there plenty of cheaper z690 mbs ranging from around $250 and up.,youâ€™ll need to upgrade the bios and msi gives you everything youâ€™ll need in the box depending on which mb you purchase.,box accessories win goes to msi easily and youâ€™ll get a usb so that you can update your bios.,"obviously the cheaper boards wonâ€™t have as many features as the higher end boards, but if you are simply gaming and donâ€™t plan on doing any major overclocks you wonâ€™t have to spend a ton on money.",if you need dual pcie 5.0 slots then msi will be your cheapest route while offering you two pcie 5.0 slots at $349.99 at the moment.,"you wonâ€™t be getting that with the strix-e, but strix-e does have an additional pcie 4.0 slot.",both boards will give you three x16 slots.,"the msi z690 carbon is solid, but the vrms temps are better\\lower on asus.",this might not be a huge problem for most people though unless you are doing some major overclocks and benchmarking the cpu for long periods of time.,the z690 carbon also gives you features that the strix-e has such as the led on the motherboard for diagnostics and cpu temps etc.,this is absent from the strix-f board that i have.,i thought it was great for msi to include that at the price point.,"the overclocking menuâ€™s are different, but i found that msi uefi\\bios menuâ€™s were far more helpful than asus, however, asus has a proven standard and itâ€™s easy to find information for it.","asus â€œmightâ€ be a little better or easier to overclock on, but that just comes down to preference.","the z790 would be better since they will have all of the microcode updates for intelâ€™s 13th gen cpus, meaning that you wonâ€™t need to update the bios and it should be less buggy.",i wouldnâ€™t worry about the z690 being buggy though.,youâ€™ll more than likely get more pcie lanes on the z790 depending on company that you choose.,"no major changes other that ddr5 memory slot upgrades, but z690 can hit some pretty impressive numbers.",iâ€™m not sure what you mean about running m.2 on pcie 5 unless you have a pcie m.2 card.,youâ€™ll be running pcie 4.0 (x4 mode) from the cpu if you install the m.2 on the motherboard.,that should be more than enough for anyone.,iâ€™m hitting 7gb\\s with my ssd on my z690 m.2 slot.,"i have used an pcie based ssd for years so i will tell you this, watch out for those pcie 3.0 x16 slots.","they run at far lower speeds than you would imagine which will cause you to lose performance (which would defeat the purpose of upgrading).asus really let me down on this one with the pcie slots which is why i wasnâ€™t going to get the strix-f, but it support both lga1200 coolers and lga1700 cooolers.",so for the price msi appears to be solid when comparing to asus and when i upgrade my gaming rig\\workstation next year iâ€™ll be definitely checking out msi.,"asus is great, but iâ€™m more or less done with them as they have clearly become the â€œpremiumâ€ brand.","for my use cases i prefer stability more than anything else so i run overclocks, but i have to take a lot into consideration like power wattage\\heat as i use my computer for more than gaming.",now for gaming youâ€™ll have nothing to worry about since intel has pretty low wattage during gaming sessions.,good luck and hopefully i was able to help in some way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

trust me man i know the feeling.,prior to my z690 + 12th gen i9-12900k i was running the x58.,just in case you don't know...the x58 was released in 2008 !,"however, i understood technology pretty well way back then and literally got a decade out of the platform due to some key updates throughout sandy, ivy, broadwell & haswell.",my platform could even compete with ryzen 1 when it released a decade later.,"when the rtx 3080 released in late 2020 i got my hands on one and wrote an article showing the performance on my x58 (2008) vs modern machines in 2020 & 2021. you view the article here:[https://overclock-then-game.com/index.php/benchmarks/29-x58-rtx-3080-review](https://overclock-then-game.com/index.php/benchmarks/35-x58-rtx-3080-production-benchmarks)

i also have other articles showing the x58 + rtx 3080 in production benchmarks and cpu performance in various programs.",so that's pcie 2.0 in the modern day against pcie 4.0 and now pcie 5.0. i'm working on my final x58 article before i finally retire the beast 1st generation intel platform.,"i'm not on reddit as much, but if you want to keep in touch you can join the discord server.","we talk about pretty much anything technology with the most attention on the big 3 (intel, amd, nvidia), but not limited to them.","hey man if you find custom loops fun, by all means do it.",especially if you know you won't be upgrading the platform for a long time.,just make sure you do extensive leak tests and try to make draining or adding water as painless as possible.,one thing that's keeping me from custom loops are the leaks.,i've never suffered a leak (knock on wood) with all of my aios so far.,there are many options.,my cpu and gpu are cooled.,cpu has a 360mm rad and the gpu has a 280mm rad.,both are aio.,with intel or amd custom loop might be the best bet for you anyways since both can get pretty dang warm.,also no problem man and i am glad i was able to help you out.,you'll make the best decision i know it.,sadly i don't think i'll ever run another build for a decade.,"i'm pretty much on the bleeding edge of technology mostly due to what i need to use my pc for (work, gaming, production and so on).",so i've already committed myself to a 2 year cycle.,"i'm already maxing out my i9-12900k, but it's still a beast.",i just need as much compute power\\ipc as i can get.,i guess i'll either start collecting pc parts from my upgrades or selling my previous builds online or something.....who knows.,by the way ddr5 is the best way to go at this point so you are on the right page.,you can continue to use it in the future.,ddr4 is going to be getting phased out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"try different outputs on your gpu, and make sure all connections are seated properly.",also its possible your mobo is prioritizing integrated graphics for some reason.,plug your display cable into your motherboard to get your cpu integrated graphics maybe.,if you tried multiple monitors and gpu's and no luck then i'd imagine its a motherboard problem.,"best of luck, sometimes the silliest thing can be the issue on new builds like one setting being off in the bios",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you won't know yourself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'm doing the same upgrade soon!,"4670k to 13600k, can't wait!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7700k?,to expensive to be worth it i guess?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"games using less threads than you have, but pegging a single thread to 100%, will bottleneck you but something like msi afterburner is reporting total cpu usage, so it'll reflect something lower than 100%.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">4770k

if you see your cpu stuck at 12.5% usage it means you have 1 core 100% usage.",(100% divided by 8 cores = 12.5% per core.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean.... if u can't get a good deal on both at once no point passing up on one of them.,you definitely won't loose performance in the meantime till u upgrade both.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my original build was a 770 which died and i replaced with a 1660s 3 years ago or so.,i'm still at 1080p so it's doing the job for now.,will go for a 3080 and 1440p 144hz  when the prices are better here (aus).,your cpu might not be as much of a bottleneck as mine was but it's a night and day difference in normal use and gives me room to upgrade the gpu and make a nice and hopefully long lasting machine.,think i got nearly 8 years out the last setup bar the graphics card and a power supply.,"if i get the same out of the new build, i'll be stoked.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at some point it's definitely worth it.,with some games my cpu is bottlenecking my gpu like 40%.,having a better gpu wouldn't do you any good i that case.,i5 6400 and gtx 970 btw,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm still on a 4790k and 1070ti.,my plan is to upgrade my platform to 13600k in the next month then upgrade the gpu in the spring.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, it is worth upgrading.","especially from 4790k, you will see a noticeable difference going to 13th gen, even 12th or 11th i think.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, depending on the game.",when i upgraded from.,"4770 to a ryzen 1700, there was a big uplift in civ 4 and 6 turn times for example.",any games with single core or low threads can benefit.,flight simulator is another one.,iâ€™m now on a ryzen 3950x and can find single thread scenarios that bottleneck even with that.,also may benefit other uses.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i found a good deal on a used 3070 a few weeks ago.,saw minimal gains over my 1080 as even that was bottlenecked in some games by my cpu.,even at 1440p.,so now i have the full potential of the 3070 with my cpu barely getting to 40% utilization in most games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't wait.,i upgraded the 3570k to a 12600k rocking the same 1070 gtx.,it transformed vr.,it's very nice always using 100% gpu.,finally the 10 series unleashed.,plus it's not just games.,"everything else is such a pleasure to use now, i open shit without thinking, lightroom minimize open a game who cares.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i am upgrading from a 7700k right now, but honestly it hardly feels like a must even with a 3080.

yea my thoughts too.,i can't think of any scenarios that will push my cpu and gpu to their max simultaneously.,i think i'll see how it goes and if i detect any instability i might throttle the cpu or get a new psu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what chip are you planning on going with?,i'm not decided yet as i plan to upgrade sometime early next year.,i was leaning 7700x personally but it's hard to recommend that at current prices when the 13600k is around now.,"i don't nitpick between benchmarks myself, i feel like most people will barely tell the difference between these chips as any of current gen chips will destroy the 7700k and would be a significant upgrade.",i feel like the 7700x will be dropping to 300$ when the 3dvcache models drop next year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think limiting power draw to max tdp on both is just the right way to go anyway.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hmmm if you need to upgrade i would go for  12600k instead.,you will save at least $300 on mobo and cpu.,since you game at 1440p.,between 12600k vs 13600k is about 15% at best difference at 1440p.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you have the patience of a god.,i couldn't wait if i was in that situation.,even w the old gpu (i'd oc if not already done) your pc will just move a lot faster.,gpu is really only noticeable during gaming or other professional things that i don't do.,godspeed to you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah you could probably buy a 12400f and a cheap ddr4 board for the same price as the 7700k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hwinfo or afterburner if you want to see a screen full of thread info in a game, itâ€™s too much for normal use but you can see",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to me it was an easy call to go with a 13600k.,"i can carry over my ddr4 kit and buy a dirt cheap b660 board that allows memory oc - it will be just fine for the next two years or so, later on i can upgrade to a by-then discounted z-board and far better (value) ddr5 ram vs current offerings to unlock extra performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

limiting a 13700k or 13900k to about 150w pl1 and 125w pl2 (13900k) or 125w pl1 95w pl2 (13700k) will cap power at 150w or below without any performance cost to gaming.,gaming is almost entirely desensitized to power limits because you only need to power 30% of your cpu before amdahls law kicks in - gaming just isn't a very parallel task at heart - it's all about running a small part of your cpu at full power which can easily be done on a power budget.,"multithreaded performance is different because by default you actually do want to power all the silicon you have, but running the suggested settings would only drop performance by about 10%.","that last bit of performance, if your want it, is where you spend 150w more and power draw becomes ridiculous.",i don't think that's worth it.,"with a 150w power limit on the cpu, you have 700w left to power a 4090 and the rest of the system.","power limiting the 4090 to 80% would make it draw less than 350w at the cost of like 7,5% performance.","the only annoying part about power limiting the 4090 is that msi afterburner doesn't seem to auto apply my profile at startup, but it's probably a setting somewhere.",at this point your pc is completely quiet and at less than 500w for cpu+gpu.,i literally have zero worries about my 850w psu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"not necessarily, although the qvls list higher memory speeds than z690 as the manufacturers have had access to higher frequency memory kits as the ddr5 manufacturing processes mature.","perhaps some individual boards have better memory traces than their predecessors, but to my knowledge most of the support would come from the cpu's integrated memory controller.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that's a solid score!,"i build dedicated small form factor rendering boxes for a workload that basically mirrors cinnebench multi-thread performance, and have found the ryzen 5950x had been the cheapest/coolest/fastest option to hit just under that 30k score (28500 is normal with pbo enabled and 3600/cl16 ram), but that was before am5 and raptor lake.","i'm evaluating the current generation options from both intel and amd, but my biggest concern right now is cooling as the 5950x is so power efficient i'm getting away with just a thermalright peerless assassin air cooler in an asus ap201 case kitted up with arctic p14/p12 pwn pst fans, no throttling or temp concerns with multi-hour sustained workloads.","the price of the 13700k at $400 is almost $150 cheaper than the 5950x @ micro center, and since the workload in question doesn't care about ram speed ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fin8llhsqmg&t=1079s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fin8llhsqmg&t=1079s) ) so i'm going to prototype a b660 board with robust vrm's + the same 3600/cl16 ram kit and ssd with a slight bump in the cooler to the deepcool ak620 and see if it stays out of thermal + performance throttling territory.","should produce the same rendering output speed but save around $130 per machine, i really prefer to avoid liquid cooling from a ""fewer points of failure"" standpoint if i can avoid it.",i only wish the 13900k wasn't so insane on heat/power unless you tune down performance with power limitations or throw in a huge liquid cooler... guess that will be next after i see how the 13700 shakes out so i can standardize on a single basic platform design.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

how's your power draw from the wall like for idle and in lightly threaded loads like multi-tab browsing?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is bs that a 170w 13700k is not losing any bit performance that a 300w 13700k.,doesnâ€™t make sense at all.,"my 12600k is running 190w in r23 at 1.35v, top temperature reached 79c with a cheap 240mm aioâ€¦",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you're aware that the 1700 socket has problems with contact right?,application of thermal paste will not solve the issue if it's not making appropriate contact.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no idea, i'm not using one.",the fuma 2 only has 6 heat pipes vs the 7 heat pipes in this cooler.,"at the stock 253w tdp i see a sustained 86c in r23, you'd probably just be a few degrees warmer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

your bios is limiting the chips power in some way.,if i run a stock bios i'll peak around the same wattage you're seeing there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yep definitely true, if you want all the performance that's perfectly fine too.","i'm actually using a b660 board, it works perfectly for gaming.",but for rendering and stuff a higher end board would probably be some benefit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i cant measure from the wall, the only measurements i can give are what hardware info 64 gives out",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is losing performance.,it loses 10% in cinebench and blender tests.,its just the amount of performance you lose isnt proportional to the power draw because of how insanely hard these cpus are pushed out of the box,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
he's not losing single core performance or when using a few threads since the cpu does not exceed 150w or even less under typical gaming scenarios.,"he said he loses 10% in all threaded workloads, which is excellent if you consider he reduced the consumption in half.",see for yourself.,"limit your 12600k to 100w or so and you'll only lose 10-15% performance, not half.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is not bs.,read up on frequency and voltage scaling behavior.,intel released raptorlake cpus closer to the upper limit of these two parameters (as did nvidia with the 4000 series).,"undervolting potential is huge in the current hardware gen.

"it's called pl, there's pl1 and pl2.",should be in your bios somewhere.,"pl2 in the short power limit, it's duration is defined by t (you can also change that), then it shifts back to pl1, and jumps back again after a while to pl2.","rinse, repeat.","if you have a beefy cooler, i think it makes sense to set pl1 = pl2 because, at least from what i'm seeing on my system, the main issue is the crazy heat spike coming from the cpu under high loads.",the radiator itself simply cannot transfer this much heat from the cpu to itself that quickly.,"whereas on laptops or with puny desktop coolers, oscillating between low power and high power might make sense if it takes a while for the radiator (not the cpu, the radiator itself) to dissipate the heat.",play around with it until you're happy with the temps.,"since you have a k, you can micromanage the shit out of it and try to undervolt it to keep the temps down (the ideal case is lowest possible voltage at highest possible clock speed while not hitting any power or thermal limits and keeping the temps as low as possible, and also being 100% stable at synthetic loads; none of which is possible simultaneously, so you have to compromise to your liking).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it depends on your motherboard.,what brand do you have?,for the gigabyte boards its in the bios the tweaker section.,"then under cpu, then in advanced cpu settings.",then at the bottom there is a section with level 1 and 2 ppt power limits and you can set the power limits and the duration.,if you dont want the power budget to change at all set both to the same number and unlimited,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not really, performance is good enough.","when not thermal throttled i get a peak score of 30,450. so i only lost like 0.4% performance after throttling for 10 minutes.","which is why i kept fans speeds at 70%, keeps noise down quite a bit and performance is about the same anyways.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

is the deepcool ak620 a convex cooler?,"because i saw a massive 10 degree temp and core to core delta drop using the frame on my 13700k, looking at the thermal paste on the cooler taking it off there was zero contact on the middle and side like gamers nexus showed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the issue i had with the intel s1700 socket was not the thermals, but too much pressure on the pins causing memory compatibility issues on my gigabyte z690 board.",given the high thermals that the raptor lake parts are putting out at full power i don't see the downside in a $13-$15 thermalright frame to potentially provide a slight thermal improvement along with avoiding some of the longer term issues with uneven mounting pressure including warped cpu's and potential memory compatibility.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well it's the same shape as adl and it's the locking mechanism that does it to adl which has the same mechanism for rpl.,a contact frame should work exactly the same for rpl as it does adl.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yea, i'm very glad to hear that.","my contact frame probably does nothing in my case but i had to replace it just to keep my mind sane - ocd hits hard...

thanks.,i've watched those videos long time ago.,i doubt if they applied enough thermal paste.,"but no matter what, even if the silicone grease is evenly distributed on cpu lid and the cooler is in good contact with cpu lid, the thermal conductivity of commercial silicone grease thermal paste nowadays is not enough to meet the thermal requirements of a 200w+ cpu, so whether it is well distributed or not is not the most important thing, the most important thing is that the thermal conductivity of the thermal interface material should be high enough.","as i said, my thermal paste is not evenly coated, but i have no problem.",maybe my last paragraph answered your question.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

remember to check out fps gains on youtube if you are using it for gaming only.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the ram that you picked as an alternative seems like a good option for 300 euros.,the only other option would be getting something much cheaper and then waiting for a few months to see if faster and cheaper ram comes out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
honestly not sure if 7200 is going to make a big difference or not.,but it wasn't that big in gaming based on the testing results.,"you should also take latency into consideration as well, that actually makes a difference in some cases.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"don't use enhanced turbo, it's a terrible setting.","it'll set each core to it's maximum multiplier, for a 13900k that means 2 cores at 58x with the other 6 at 55x.",you'll get mostly 55x multiplier performance with vastly increased vcore requirements for that 5.8 ghz frequency.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if the system has been stable with that setting enabled, you can use it as a baseline for a manual overclock.","basically, keep the same clockspeeds mce/et was running and try reducing the voltage in 0.0250vcore increments until the system is failing stress test, then bring it back up one or two ticks.",my 12700k can do 5ghz p-cores @ 1.250vcore while et tries to run the same speed @ 1.300vcore (sometimes spiking upwards of 1.320v),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

is yours also with power limit removed?,would be interesting to see your temps and how much power draw you have.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if you only play games on it you'll see exactly zero performance difference between unlimited and 150w power limit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's basically an overclocking profile, it's forcing the cpu to work on higher frequencies across all cores, but it takes more voltage to do so, therefore more power draw and more heat.","i would recommend to turn it off - difference in performance is small (about 5% in cinebench, in real life tasks, it's gonna be lower) but power draw is higher (about 250w vs. 320-340w on cpu package power) and the temps are way higher (80â°c vs. 100â°c even with best aio, you basically need a custom water loop in order to have good temps).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what do you recommend doing instead?,iâ€™m not too knowelgeable with over clocking.,and the gaming power use is very tame with these settings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not a bad idea to reduce the voltage.,iâ€™m still shocked it used 340 watts of power during cinebench.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"they are, been using them for years",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mce is short for multicore enhancement.,asus and motherboard vendors usually have this on by default.,what it does is it removes power limits when under full load.,so if you watched reviewers.,some cpus took more than 300+ watts under full load.,disabling mce caps the max wattage to 253w which is intels default .,now these chips run extremely hot anyway.,almost no reason to have mce on as it will 100%  make your cpu throttle as no cooler can get that under control unless a custom loop.,i saw 0 performance issues with turning mce off.,i went from 100c package to 75-85c average with some hot cores hitting 95 once or twice.,now this was 10 minutes of cinebench r23.,so it was extreme stress test.,if you are gaming you will be nowhere near the 253 limit.,games do not make the cpu hit power limits so it doesnâ€™t matter for gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so the problem was asus.,i did intel mei update no i have full ram speed and a score with 38000 points,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ultimately every chip up to the 10900k has the exact same ipc.,"clock for clock, there's no difference there.","that means that if you're playing a game that only really needs anywhere from 1-4 cores, you gain absolutely nothing going to the top skylake based chip.","having more cores is nice, if you can keep them cool, but they aren't always necessary.",what *is* necessary is ipc gains as that's what really pushes performance forward in gaming.,not every workload can be heavily parallelized to earn effective gains by splitting it over several cores.,"unfortunately, we only really saw one major leap in ipc over the last 7 years, and that's alder lake.","now we're getting 13th gen which is nothing more than a refresh of that now old series, since it's based on the same architecture and manufacturing process.","yeah it clocks higher and that's nice, but i'd rather wait for a new architecture on a new node that will deliver better clock for clock gains in performance and potentially match at least a ryzen x900 in terms of core count (12 big cores is my ideal for a next gen pc upgrade.)","if i'm going to invest damn near $1000 or more into a system upgrade, i'm going to make it count, and i can't do that by buying a refresh of a 1 year old cpu.","i got burned that way with my 7700k, i won't do it again.",i predict 14th gen will do to raptor lake what coffee lake did to kaby lake.,we'll see.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel's own slide: https://images.anandtech.com/doci/17601/raptor%20lake%20slides_31.png

yeah i have heard about  the mounting issues a bit.,maybe 13th gen is a bit better with z790.,but the cpus looked almost identical side by side.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when i went to reapply thermal paste after the initial crash i did not notice anything out of the ordinary from the first time i slapped it on there.,but itâ€™s one of those things i tend to over think.,did i tighten it too much?,not enough?,etc etc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got a 420 on mine and when i let it have all the power it wants itâ€™ll crank up to 90c real quick.,but stays around 50-60 under load when iâ€™m just letting the standard intel boosting go with 5.5 across all p cores and a couple of them boosting up to 5.8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"from what i have seen in reviews,  360 > 420 could not tame it, still hit 100c but took maybe 5 sec more lol

if anything i am looking to slightly undervolt this thing... curious if anyone has seen a good link for walk through fo that?",i hear undervolt vs setting the ppl is better so it doesnt mess with clock heights but who knows,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ll just say that the 13900k has more cores and will definitely be hotter but when gaming 50-75 during gameplay (not loading the game as something like that makes cpu go hotter) is perfectly normal and fine as thatâ€™s what i get.,i get around 65c in warzone which is cpu heavy.,iâ€™d definitely make sure to disable mce if you do and other than that your golden.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well your right but mce just adds a lot of extra heat and voltage that is not needed as it makes your cores turbo even higher.,and it adds very little performance for the extra 1-2 frames.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it does run better.,i get about 40-45 fps.,but i've seen the game run on 60 fps 1080p in many older versions of the cpu and with the same iris gpu so it makes me think of there's something else that's limiting the performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

these cpus will be within a few percentage points of each other.,you are most likely limited by power or thermals anyways before hitting any theoretical limits of the chips.,"similarly with the faster ram, it gives you a few percent at best (mainly benefits the integrated graphics i'd assume).","optane is great, but unless you know that you need it, you probably don't need it.",get a regular m.2 ssd with your device and you'll be fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"cpu wise, the 1165g7 and 1195g7 differ very slightly with the latter having higher clockspeeds.",the biggest difference in performance in you list would be the ram speeds.,go for the lpddr4x memory config if you intend to use the iris xe gpu considerably as the higher ram speeds will proportionally increase your gpu performance as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

approach: i didn't want to lose capability from the cpu, otherwise what would be the point of buying a good cpu right ?",so my first approach was to just modify easy settings.,remediation: i changed one single entry in the msi configuration.,"in oc set cpu cooler tuning to ""boxed cooler"".",by default mine was on tower cooler.,i know that the d15 is a tower cooler but what is really do is change the max power provided to the cpu from 270 (tower setting) to 180 (box setting).,"which is anyway the max power wanted by this cpu, so basically we are just saying ""don't overfeed it"".","results:

i've heard but i'm not a fan of aio reliability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what stress test are u using,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm not sure since i applied everything all at once but what really made a difference was going in msi bios and adjusting the cpu advanced features from mode 12 to mode 9 ðÿ‘,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so you intake from the basement fresh air and in the top exhaust ?,what do the side fans do ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i like to run a silent system.,so far this aio is very quiet.,highly recommended,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hey, i wanted to get this setup too, is the thermal paste that comes with the liquid 280 enough or should i buy some extra?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
does the thermaltake plate help at all?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"open the case,turn on the pc,watch the fans spinning up.",they should be spinning relativelylow and even speed without serious load on the cpu.,then after a few minutes start a benchmark or game or whatever what will load your cpu to 100 celsius degrees.,the fans should not keep the same speed under heavy load like they do in idle state.,"if they do,than something is wrong with the speed control of the fans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm really sorry but i can't give much info on air coolers keeping the temps down, but i have read some other threads on this cooler where people were stating they are using a noctua nh-d15 and temps are ok",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you want to go full load set a power limit and get the best cooler you can afford,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah exactly, when i tried mode 1 and loaded mw2 i was crashing out after a few seconds.","i didn't run a real stress test, but i have done some benchmark in games that have the feature such as hitman 3, mw2 and didn't crash

that's a lot of change, how is your performance in games?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[my results on hot 12900k after 10 mins multicore cinebench run.,a very slight undervolt to 0.030](https://i.postimg.cc/bnrpdg4t/img-20221021-wa0013.jpg)it covers ram visuals but still can fit plates.,at least on my mobo height is enough (prime z690),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there are plenty of options that will work if you have space in your case for it.,"d15 is great, and a new one is due, but idk when it will drop.","currently, deepcools asssassin 3 is the king of air coolers going by multiple reviews.","it costs around the same as the d15, but gives 1-3 degrees better performance.","they also have ak620 tower cooler that is very close to d15 in performance, is shorter, and costs noticeably less especially on sale.",this is a good buy imo.,"[https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/xujig0/cooler\_deepcool\_ak620\_highperformance\_cpu\_cooler/](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/xujig0/cooler_deepcool_ak620_highperformance_cpu_cooler/)

you're right.,it is.,but that's how it is: https://youtu.be/ktrosyzeuw8?t=112,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
something is wrong with your heatsink contact.,air gap or film wasn't taken off.,take off the heatsink and check the thermal paste spread on both surfaces.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"holy crap you weren't kidding, lite mode really does make all the difference

at default 12 my cpu's voltage got over 1.4, when now it doesn't even get to 1.3

i disabled half the e-cores, hyperthreading, & enhanced turbo.",cpu lite mode 1 seems to be working for me with prime95.,"if only the 6 p-cores it gets to low 80s, if on all 10 cores it only gets to high 70s.",fans reach max rpm at 80c.,"may have to play around some more in the future, maybe turn enhanced turbo back on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"rear exhaust, back intake.",i figured out the heat issue and set the cpu mode to 9 instead of 12. never gets passed 85 now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what came with it was more than enough.,works like a charm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks.,i was reading up on using cpu lite which drops the temps and has very little of a performance hit.,one video dropped the temps on full load from thermal throttle to around 70c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"12900k which is supposed to be hotter than 13600k, my usual temps are:
35-40 idle

below 90 on cpu benchmarks",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

a 13600k gaming should be around 80w package power with a 3090ti.,you would be able cool it with the old intel stock heatsink strapped down with zipties.,take a pic of what it looks like.,clearly something is wrong at the heatsink interface or you're pumping 1.5v to the cpu constantly.,also post hwinfo64 sensor page so we can rule out the second possibility.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh nice.,80c is still above what i would want but maybe if i try mode 7 and see if it is stable enough.,probably will be a few weeks out if i pull the trigger.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yep, this whole thread was helpful to me",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wow so never gets past 83 really?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"damn that cooler is impressive, might have to just end up covering my ram",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got one out of box from amazon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you have a 13600k?,mine runs at around 5.1 ghz all the time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13600k is rated 125w package by intel and 180+ in boost mode,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i never go above 70 during long gaming sessions.,just get a good 360aio and have plenty of intake/exhaust case fans.,my case helps being a corsair 5000d airlflow.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have a 12th gen so i know these cpu operate and there are plenty of power reviews on the internet for a 13600k.,obviously you have something else wrong in your system as well.,did you update the me firmware for the 13th gen cpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's for all-core loads.,gaming wattage is around 80w with a 3090ti,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what game?,it can also be affected if your cases air flow is not great.,games like cyber punk or other huge open world games can hit the cpu harder.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'll definitely have to consider it then thank you!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea i think you'll be fine!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think the money savings of lga1700 and ddr4 makes the intel 12th/13th gen far superior to am5 right now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love how single digit differences in fps and a few games where the diffences is 10% or less is called smashing.,one could just as well bring up stuff like horizon and cs and the scale would dip by 10% into the other direction.,the reality is that both cpu's arhitectures are extremly close in gaming to the point one would not notice.,intel on average is probably ahead by a little but both sides have their outliers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i donâ€™t know if iâ€™d say â€œsmashesâ€ but it performs really well and takes the crown in a number of titles.,lots of good cpus to choose from which is good for all of us.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel 7 is comparable to tsmc 7nm, so they are not as far behind as you think.",the 10900k competed extremely well against the tsmc 7nm zen 2. intel's architecture is extremely good at squeezing out performance from their aging nodes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
something off with those results.,every other site sees the 5950x getting smashed with 7950x/13900l trading blows yet this one has way different results.,this is why i avoid no name sites.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
id imagine sub 200fps will perform pretty much identically.,otherwise the bottleneck would be your monitor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would not call differences of less than 10percent in gaming smashing.,even so at higher resolutions where the difference is even smaller.,"true intel has the advantage in terms of price for building the whole system and you save more, but let's not forget that anyone building a 13900k,7950x 4090 rig is not concerned about value at all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
smash?,lol at 4k and 1440p pretty much the same... if for some reason you are stuck on 1080p like it's 2008 then why are you even looking at these?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my $299 13600k with it's 5.7ghz all core oc is actually beats stock 13900k's in gaming.,"and yes, i do have a rtx 4090.

i did the same thing with the 12600k and rtx 3090.

i'm yes, i will admit, i am mostly a gamer.","however, if you guys are professional diehard benchmark guys and all you do is run benchmarks 6 - 8 - 10 hours a day, that's a good enough reason to spend the extra nearly $400 for both the 7950x and 13900k.",with out a doubt.,"and yes, a lot of guys love the the high-end cpu's for geekbench, 3dmark, cinebench, etc.","if any of you guys are just gamers and play mostly games along with desktop usage, the 13600k is a gaming beast.",that extra money can go toward the rtx 4080 that's launching here shortly or what have you.,good luck.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"um, no?",they are pretty identical gaming performance wise,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just occured to me - didn't microsoft fuck up the scheduler in windows 11 again for amd with a huge impact in terms of single thread performance?,like 15-25% impact or so?,this would explain the (imho) a bit too big losses here.,"nvidia cards tend to like long pipelines with their drivers - or at least this was in the last gen, so for games this would have a huge impact.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
now turn off the second ccx in the 7950x and retest lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i went with the amd 7950x and rtx4090, from amd 5950x and rtx3090.",it's been great and with 1440p+ gaming i don't think it matters too much.,"i use my system for productivity too, vms and such, so the amd was the easy choice again for me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"my 13900kf will arrive tomorrow, the k wasn't in stock when i ordered and now i'm worried since i heard the 4090 doesn't give a signal with certain new platforms, happens on amd as well but also on 13th gen",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i tell you the best cpu for a 4090. a ryzen 5 or an i5.,"ryzen 7 or i7 if you really want to ""future proof"".",stop wasting money on ryzen 9 and i9 people.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you re getting 4090, 7950x should be the choice.","unless you are saving every last buck to get the 4090. then just take 13600k, and b660/690, and ddr4.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intels 10 nm process is different from tsmcâ€™s 5nm process.,the tsmc one is also probably 10 nm.,but those things are mostly marketing malarkey,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did that really just happen?,"r3000 and r5000 were so good, and 7000 got smashed by intel in a month?",?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the litography is not a-a comparison.,intel 10 esf is denser than then tsmc n7.,"thatâ€™s why intel rebranded their 10nm esf to intel 7, to make sure consumers compare a-a.","but hey, looks like the intel 7 is mightier than the ryzen 7950x on tsmc n5 in this current case.",cant wait for 13900ks chip to see more.ðÿ™‚ðÿ™ðÿ»,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i agree with you in general but does the money savings argument really matter in this thread for someone that's looking to buy a 4090 and either ryzen 7950x or 13900k?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
people should start taking in consideration power consumption when making reviews.,"and not per benchmark, but per at least 1 or 2 years of use because that's the least someone will use a new build.","ok, i pay 50 dollars less for this item, but after 2 years of use how much it will cost me?","because if i pay 5 dollars more per month in electricity, that item actually costs 120 dolars more 2 years later.","and for 5% more performance i wouldn't use the word ""smashes"" and ""far superior"".","in this economy on these electricity prices, at least in europe, we must think long term.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1 is cheaper though... and somehow its intel?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"anyone running a 4090 is (or should be) playing at 4k to which point it hardly matters what cpu you have, even the 5900x is fine.","while intel is technically better, it's pretty pointless in reality (4k gaming)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they are both fed a lot of current,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they mean it like how someone gets ""slammed"" online.",but in reality it's 2 blue checks writing angry tweets about something no one cares about.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
performs better at 4k than the ryzen at 1080p on far cry 5. that is just embarrassing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
people still think â€œ5600x > 10900kâ€â€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah iâ€™d take those results with a grain of salt.,the 5950x should be close to 30% behind the 13900k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
after the last update of windows two weeks ago the amd cpu has been underperforming.,the initial gaming performance before the update was really impressive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ve been using resizable bar with my 5950x and 3080ti.,https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/geforce-rtx-30-series-resizable-bar-support/  is there an issue with it on the new platforms?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at 4k even the mid range cpus would produce identical results as the bottleneck is on the gpu side.,the purpose of this review is to measure which cpu has higher gaming performance and we reduce resolution as much as possible to simulate unlimited or as much gpu power as possible.,the idea is to remove the gpu from the equation so we can isolate and test the cpu.,with a 4090 at 1080p the 13900k is outperforming the 7950x by 10-20% and the lead is even bigger in the minimum frame rates.,"if in the coming years we get a gpu that performs at 4k the same way a 4090 currently does at 1080p, you would get similar differences in framerates between these cpus and this hypothetical gpu at 4k instead of 1080p.",those that hang onto their cpus for years will find value in such tests since most people often use a cpu for many years and upgrade through 1-3 generations of gpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"itâ€™s no where near 5 dollars a month, considering in gaming both cpus use way less than the normal stress tests.","for example in benchmarks my 12900k could use 200w with an overclock, but i donâ€™t see there running full on stress tests all day, no one does.",in gaming i typically see around 90-100w consumption.,"even say one cpu uses 50w more, if you gamed for 2 hours a day, everyday of the year you would use â£11.76 more, @ 35p per kw which is my electric rate in the ul, which has very inflated costs at the moment

realistically to make it â£60 a year youâ€™d need something like 100w vs a 400w cpu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no one is taking power into consideration because either a) they are making money off their pc so it doesn't matter or b) you're gaming on it and it really doesn't matter since you're never going above 100w most of the time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, because am5 is full pcie5 + ddr5, the mainboard lanes cost a lot more this was, especially since amd upped the needed specs quite a bit, so the boards will support some gens more without the hiccups from the first ryzen release in 2017.

still the price hike from mainboard manufacturers is ... unreal.","am4 you got good boards way below 100â‚¬ ...

my prediction (and probably a very obvious one)

1rst gen. rough but capable
2nd gen, solid competition in the higher middle range market.","3rd gen solid competition in all segments, not taking the crown, but has a cost/performance advantage.","and the 4th gen they will be on top in somethings, fall back in others but will have solid equal offering in top end, while still having a competitive mid range of products good enough that they will dictate the cost of this range.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in gaming all these high end cpus use like the same power.,reviews release stress test benchmarks and then people lose their mind when 90% of customers are going to be mostly just gaming at most,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends.,if you are on a mobo that supports the 5800x3d absolutely it's a nobrainer.,but the new 13th gen i5 is no joke.,couple it with a cheap z690mobo and ddr4 and you've got one god damn good cpu build if you are starting from scratch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

imma get the 4090 first.,my chip can handle 5.2ghz all core fine so it should survive for another year or two.,i am not happy about the lga1700 socket to not be supported anymore so hopefully the 14th gen socket will be a bit more future proof.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"honestly i donâ€™t feel necessary an upgrade to 13900k and 4090, i could make it istantly but in my situation, with the few games i play and with the few free time, i will keep the 10900k and the 3080 rog (tuned very well) for at least another gpu gen",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think the 3 leading edge mfrs.,will charge the price that is cost competitive and meet us requirements.,"that is what boeing, lockheed, and n. grumman, and others all already do.",and yes of course they will be more expensive than non-us manufacturing.,but that is because of the rigorous testing requirements demanded by us government work.,they have to be able to be audited.,"if tsmc and samsung compete for those same us government contracts, they can then decide what to do with the profits from that contract.",be it invest back home in taiwan/s.,korea or invest in new capacity in the usa.,tsmc/intel will be building new fabs in arizona.,so likely the two will share similar employees in the manufacturing side of things.,samsung will open fabs in texas.,intel already has fab mfr.,on us soil and we may see some of intel's engineers switch to tsmc/samsung and vice versa.,i think that will be good for industry.,definitely ensures a strong supply of skilled manufacturers.,this is overall good for everyone.,more leading edge chips.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"tldr: amd doesn't manufacture anything, they simply design it and outsource it to third parties.","it is a very bad thing, something nvidia does aswell.",intel afaik is the only major producer that actually manufacturers.,"it's a really unfortunate and dangerous situation, given that samsung and tsmc are located at the spot where there is most likely to be conflict in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"google says 2024 for arizona foundry at 20,000 wpm at 5nm node.","looks meaningful to me and not ""years and years"" but i'm open to any actual insight you might have.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is overall good for everyone except the taxpayers who have to pay for the whole circus.,there are two general buckets of government acquisition.,"in bucket 1, there are things that must be made for the government and have no commercial equivalent to compare against.",in bucket 2 there is the stuff that is identical to what is available on the commercial market with the only difference being that it's acquired through the vendor that meets arcane usgov contracting requirements.,they can sell otherwise not competitive product for a much higher price than the open market would tolerate.,"that's what intel is going after, and it's a good market to go after if you're worried about not being able to compete in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
neither tsmc or samsung are us companies.,"even if they have factories in america, they wouldn't qualify since they aren't american companies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> it is a very bad thing, something nvidia does aswell.",intel afaik is the only major producer that actually manufacturers.,"it's not a ""bad"" thing though.",there are benefits and disadvantages to that.,the issue is more along the line of the us not having proper manufacturing capability to begin with.,"this puts the country at risk during times of uncertainty, but we can almost say that about a lot of things in the us.","we overall rely on a lot of imports, and most of that has to do with how the us government failed us.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"
>it is a very bad thing, something nvidia does aswell.",intel afaik is the only major producer that actually manufacturers.,"it is not a ""really bad thing"" and in fact most of the hardware innovation that has come in the last few years is due to this model.",modern nodes are too expensive to develop to support a lot of competition in the fabrication space and if every fab had their hand in the design cookie jar there'd be a lot less variety.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you want to be fair.,"amd used to manufacture its chips, but due in part of intel's anti competitive practices they had to divest that business.","now the tax payer is rescuing intel's fabs, where was such bail out for amd when it needed it?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they simply donâ€™t have the capacity to actually sustain chip production in the us if some major geopolitical event were to happen and china takes taiwan and nationalizes tsmc chip production and technology 

they have some limited fabrication capacity , but not at nearly at the scale of intel

itâ€™s actually a national security risk to not have significant and sustainable chip manufacturing in house

also, it takes years to actually scale up production.","intel has it down to 5 years to make a new fab, but that is significantly faster than most other companies

edit: also, 20k wafers per month is proportionally nothing compared to intel or tsmc",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"by 2024 intel will either be dead and this fab would be useless for national security considering cutting edge hpc would be 3nm+ or n4x, or intel will finally salvage its broken node and be at parity with tsmc yet with significantly more local capacity.",they won't be making radiation hardened 5nm chips so that's not a replacement for a national security fab at all.,it's literally just a hedge in case intel goes bankrupt and taiwan gets taken over simultaneously.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i dont know.,us government security is something that cannot be easily given a value.,"countries trust the usa to provide security and in trusting the usa, those governments and their people also trust that we have a secure manufacturing chain.",i dont know how much that plays into those type of deals.,but it does add us jobs which i am for.,intel makes good stuff.,they were leading edge for decades until 2018 when tsmc n7 first launched.,they will be back again.,i wouldn't worry about intel long term.,for years and decades tsmc chased intel.,and it was so happen that the intel guys were so confident that they could figure out quad patterning and self aligning duv that they fell behind.,it happens.,they did not have a backup plan and that was their mistake.,again due to over confidence.,which again happens.,now they are back on track and fully embracing euv (their technology).,so this is excellent for the market.,but yes they did miss mobile.,that was a major pitfall.,but it was likely good for the entire industry.,just now we only have 1 leading edge mfr.,tsmc.,samsung isn't really leading edge.,they are likely behind intel.,we need intel to succeed.,samsung has other interests and already mfr.,nand flash chips so likely they are not as competitive as i think intel v. tsmc.,which is great actually.,2 leading edge.,excellent for arizona.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
still found $5.4b to pay for ati so i say they had the money but decided to spend it somewhere else.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in some way, you can argue that amd failed to make their case to the government to get the support needed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol.,"intel has almost as much cash on hand as amd has revenue, they don't need a bailout.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a long way to say that amd failed to make their in house chip production competitive 

god forbid china takes taiwan amd has no product",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel isn't why glofo fell so far behind,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> ... china takes taiwan and ~~nationalizes~~ looks at the smoldering remains of tsmc chip production and technology

ftfy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they don't need to sustain all production in the us.,tsmc won't have end-to-end us production from sand to cpu.,neither does intel.,"for the small subset of tsmc customers that would be interested in *more expensive* us fabs in the first place, 20k wpm is very significant.",we're not talking apple and xbox volumes.,"it takes years to scale up production, and it has already been years since samsung and tsmc started - and it will be a rather mature process at that point.",i'm not sure how relevant intel's metrics on scaling production are when their process nodes have been arriving years behind schedule.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> by 2024 intel will either be dead..
 
lmao",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's 1/10th of what the tax payers are giving to intel.,and a good part of it was bought with stock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not really since there was no such political will back then.,as per usual the government failed to be pro active about it.,if anything intel should be forced to spin off its fabs so that other american companies aren't at a disadvantage.,now that the american tax payer is subsidizing this business.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> a long way to say that amd failed to make their in house chip production competitive 

intel failed to make their in house cpu production competitive until the government stepped in.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they had little something to do with it i'd say.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, thats not an issue for national security though 

having 2% higher capacity to make high end gpus is not going to impact the security of the us and its military",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

> not really since there was no such political will back then.,as per usual the government failed to be pro active about it.,sort of.,the political will comes from lobbying.,>if anything intel should be forced to spin off its fabs so that other american companies aren't at a disadvantage.,now that the american tax payer is subsidizing this business.,"i think that is kind of the point, that intel is separating their manufacturing from their design, and siloing it.","otherwise, they can't manufacture for apple, amd and so on.",i'm not sure two separate companies is going to give any strength here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they won't even be ""high end"" anything when they come online.","it will be things like fpgas and embedded market cpus for government, aviation, industrial and telecom that need stable, long-term supply chains and are willing to pay the premium.","it's the exact kind of product that us and others try to block from being exported to places like russia, iran, and now china - because they're used in advanced military applications among other things.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

>conflict of interest.,conflict of interest like with samsung that manufactures for half of their competitors?,"nah, intel offers a product or service and other companies buy it or don't buy it.",it's that simple.,competing in end products isn't really very relevant.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

> conflict of interest like with samsung that manufactures for half of their competitors?,worse.,intel has an established customer base and it competes in the same product categories.,samsung doesn't compete with nvidia and amd for instance.,they do compete with apple which is why apple can't use them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you read my comment?,apple switched to tsmc because of this issue.,it's a show stopper for sure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
could look at the maiboards qvl list?,maybe buy from a place that will take the ram back no real questions asked if you want extra safety?,could also ask in the amazon websites products page questions area and look in reviews to see other peoples experience.,"might also just depend on winning the silicon lottery with ram, cpu, mainboard and psu and maybe other stuff?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
officially supported is 5600mhz for both.,"conceptually/overclock supported is more up to silicon lottery, board design and quality, and bios quality.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there wasn't that much correlation between imc quality between i5/i7/i9 in 12th gen. if 13th gen is the same they're basically binned 5600 + safety margin at 0.95v vccsa and jedec voltages.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's mt/s, not mhz.",ddr5-7200 is 7200 mt/s (mega transfer per second).,"also learn to type correctly, it's not a typo when you write ""mhz"", it's ignorance.",the correct term is mhz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"theres not much difference in ddr5 imc true, but ddr4 ranges a lot worse.",my 12600k wont post at 4000g1.,"it might be the only one, but thats junk.",i've not seen any reports of 13th gen chips not managing 4000g1.,"as for ddr5, its the ram itself that seems limited to under 8000, as it runs very hot at those frequencies.","i've tried asking if anyone has tested using g4 to check for imc vs dram limitation, but it doesn't seem like anyone is doing that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

but i'll keep following it :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hey i just got the same mb but different variant (ddr4+wifi) with 13600kf on it, i can confirm after updating the bios via the flashback function it boots and works flawlessly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

want to order the same config, since i want to learn an play around with undervolting and stuff.",what ddr5 did you choose?,"couldn't really find the best go to from reviews, so still unsure which to pick",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i have this motherboard, you need a 12th gen cpu to update the bios.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if it doesn't have the flashback feature that's unfortunate.,you can buy a 12th gen cpu (cheapest is around 50â‚¬) or potentially borrow one from a friend to install the bios update i think.,but keep in mind that that's just the information i google together on the last few hours and i don't really know much about the bios update process.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hey, thanks a lot, that is a relief for me.",i hope mine has it too.,but it seems unlikely that it doesn't.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what about the processing power?,an article mentioned 12900k lost around 20% performance on a z690 maximus board.,is it true for 13600kf?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, if you look it up it will say that the components are compatible, because in theory they are.",only on some websites they go into the detail that you need the correct bios version.,thanks for your valuable input.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

checked some articles and the cpu again and it says in the specs to use 5600 ones, but i guess other ones will work just fine, not really my field of expertise",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh sorry i should've clarified, i have the ddr4 version and it didn't come with the update.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i got it 2 days ago and i haven't checked lol, honestly didn't know that to be a thing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah me neither until 3 hours ago, on the back plate where all the connections/slots are there should be one usb port marked with usb flash or smth and a little button next to it.",this allows you to update your bios without a cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wow that would've been nice to know lmao i switched cpus twice to update,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can you check if the button is there?,would relieve me ^^,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
try other slot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you try sliding the lock into place?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
does the lock actuate at all?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe there i something in the slot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this the rog z690-a?,have the same board if so and problem with lian li lancool ii mesh case.,"had to flip the cable management bar that sits to the right of the motherboard around to give more space for gpu, otherwise my evga 3080 ti would be hit that bar.",afterward i had to manually move the lock in place.,the button will work and unlock if it's properly set as a check.,clearly just flip it back into place.,was the only way i made sure it was locked myself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have that same problem with my mortgage broker.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i tried doesnt work either,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the lock on the right side actually locks the left side doesnt completely go in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so the right part completely goes in and locks.,also everything runs perfectly the card is recognized in the nvidia panel without problem but it just doesnt fit on the left side.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i checked but there is nothing in there:(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you so much for your reply man.,i really dont feel comfortable pushing more but you might be right since the card also didnt go in the second pcie slot.,the card is 10 times more expensive than the motherboard so maybe i will change the mobo one day until then it seems like i will use it like this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was also suspecting that the case was the problem and i took the whole motherboard out but apparently the motherboard is the problem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there's only one lock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've been having some issues with reddit and it appears that my previous comment was accidentally deleted.,no problem at all man.,if it's working and you don't have any issues after stressing \\ benchmarking the gpu you should be fine.,i just remember needed to use a lot of force.,initially i thought something was blocking my gpu.,luckily more force did the job.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

jump from 2666 to 3200 mhz is very noticeable and b560 should be cheap nowadays.,fps drops is simply operating system being in a dumpstertruck state.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,"xmp will probably make literally like a 5% difference in anything, even if.",your 10400 is decent but will not be given any significant boost by just an xmp profile.,why buy a new mobo just for that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

but what else could it even be then?,messed up memory timings or other mobo stuff that's not outright obvious is about the only thing i can think of at this point.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"does it matter which version of aida 64 i use, like extreme, engineer etc?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

can you run it using the main app and not the full memory cache benchmark?,ddr2400 sort of explains it.,what's the highest you can bring your memory up to?,you should be able to at least do 2666.,2933 is max supported xmp but i can't remember if that requires a core i7 at minimum.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah i've tried that, as i mentioned the only difference i noticed was that it defaults to a 65w power limit on the cpu which makes things slightly worse, setting it to max 125w makes things a bit better but it doesn't solve the issue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"alright and when i run testmem5, should i just leave the pc doing the test and not use it for anything else?",also how long would be good to leave it run?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

can you tell me how it goes?,the kf is cheaper than the k but idk if i should skimp out on igpu jic my gpu dies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have  9600k right now i really want the this cpu but i dont know if its worth the upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"been wondering myself on this one

i just bought an oc corsair dominator kit at 6000mhz

no clue the sweet spot though 

waiting for all parts to arrive for now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7200 to 7600 most likely.,unless we get ram that can do low timings at 6000+ (gaming).,"for other apps, not sure i'd they benefit at 130gbsec vs 100.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7000-7800 is gonna be the new sweet spot for awhile as these will be sk hynix a die and will clock even higher with manual oc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"most reviews i saw used 6000-6400mhz this was also recommended by intel themselves as itâ€™s part of the review package

i forgot the timings tho",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is the technical reason behind 7200/7600?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it takes that much speed to reduce the memory latency sub 50ns with hynix a die.,"this is actually extremely unimpressive as its not even dual rank, but the trcd ends up being like 48 which is too high and the voltage required is also really high.","in theory, memory at 6400mt/sec using 28 28 28 28 1t timings with tight subs would outperform it in any game because the latency would be sub 50ns.",there are some people with a die who aren't even at that level of latency and just have high mb/sec.,it's a complete waste of money.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so in your opinion witch ram / mobo chipset should i buy for a 13600/13700 for gaming ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is that non k?,go b760 or z690.,i would look for a 6000 kit as i think that uses hynix m die.,any higher and it's just the same stuff until ~6800+ which is a die.,below 6000 is usually samsung and 5200 is micron (absolute crap).,you could also just buy cheap a die from china in single sticks.,keep in mind if you aren't buying a k processor you will be limited in memory speed due to locked system agent voltage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it looks like dlss did when it was first implemented spider-man.,"this seems like an implementation issue, as compared to xess itself.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
give it some time to mature,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why tho not include intel arc gpu to see how xess performs on native hardware and how that then stacks against fsr 2.1???,guess it's one way to ruin a video.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have an idea!,"instead of using upscaling techniques, why not just reduce useless quality settings?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,xess doesn't do this in other games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the thing is, xess has been delayed for a long time, they had plenty of time to tune and improve it.",remember that it was actually announced way before fsr 2.0 and supposed to release (i.e.,become available in games) in early 2022. really quite similar to the arc driver situation.,"while we were still waiting for xess to finally become available, amd announced fsr 2.0, released it and even shipped the fsr 2.1 upgrade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"he said he would do a seperate review for that, which is fair.",this was just meant to show if xess was worth using on amd and nvdia gpu.,i don't like the conclusion he formed that developers should just straight out ignore it though.,especially not before thoroughly testing it on arc gpus.,"if it's better than fsr  in picture quality an performance on arc gpus, xess is worth keeping around.",the competition is needed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this is fair, but then the next question is ""why not both?""",?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">while we were still waiting for xess to finally become available, amd announced fsr 2.0, released it and even shipped the fsr 2.1 upgrade.",technically you are right.,we awaited xess to be out february or march this year (2022).,but it didnt arrive then.,i even joked we'd see fsr get 2.1 before it launched... and yeah.,fsr 2.1.1 released before xess lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">i don't like the conclusion he formed that developers should just straight out ignore it though

i 100% agree.",dlss 2.x had a lot of time to mature.,fsr 2.x is too maturing.,xess is new.,"lets give it a chance to get better, we know it can.","nvidia did it, amd is doing it - intel can do it too!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">
i don't like the conclusion he formed that developers should just straight out ignore it though.",what crypto boom show me is that youtubers think that gpu are only use for playing games.,and they were complaining about amd and nvidia lack of stock at launch of 3000s and 6000s  when in reality they were just selling to miners.,"and his conclusion about this it just show me that he doesn't know anything about software development,  and think that products just magically are launch in perfect state all the time.",they should just stick to doing benchmarks and show the results.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that doesn't really make much sense.,"game devs don't care about making intel competitive, that's not their job, why should they spend their time implementing a feature that is only going to be a minor benefit to 0.001% of users?","they would be much better off implementing some feature or optimizing performance or whatever else, for the benefit of everyone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"must have missed that note, but anyhow - then you won't see image quality comparison to dlss (as supposedly native hw acceleration also improves reconstruction, not just performance).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if xess gets improvement to the point of being worth using, there's no reason it can't be implemented then.","and when that happens it should be implemented in games that relevant at that time, there's not much point in spending the time to implement it in all of today's games when some of them are going to lose relevance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it doesn't take a lot resources to implement though if it's done at the same time as dlss using [nvidia's streamline framework](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-streamline-aims-to-simplify-developer-support-for-upscaling-algorithms).,it would be plug and play.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nah, he'll probably still include dlss because it would be useful for people deciding whether to buy an nvidia or intel gpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">there's no reason it can't be implemented then

because that isnt how technology works.","by your logic, the first 5 years of ambient occlusiong being added to games should not have happened since it was a flawed tech during those years.",tech needs to be implemented so as to mature.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the difference is ao didn't have any practical alternatives.,"game devs have no reason to care if xess matures, they don't work for intel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they do care though.,"a more vendor neutral, high tech competitor to dlss?",devs do care.,in fact they care so much that when there is a simple one size fits all implementation (fsr) lazier devs just did that and ignore all else.,"which isnt really optimal either, but it shows they do care.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's worse than fsr though.,and fsr is more vendor neutral.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, it is currently worse than fsr 2.1.2 (which isnt yet in games but will be).",but it has to start from somewhere so as to get better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and it has started, fantastic.","it's already in more games than dlss 1 was ever in, if intel needs more data to work with they can pay devs to implement it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
kind of weird to not test intel xess on an intel card.,it's specifically designed for intel ai hw.,it's just running in fallback mode on amd/nvidia hw where it's obviously not to going to perform as well.,"since it didn't perform as well, he then used performance/balanced modes for xess vs quality modes on dlss/frs for the image quality comparisons.",this is just seems set up to make xess look as bad as possible.,"the responsible way to test this, should have been to looks at xess first on native intel hw.",then note the performance drop off on non native hw.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel xess looks better than fsr 2.0 imo.,but what good are the more frames if it looks like shit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
his results are also weird.i dont know if its 6600xt problem or what but i have great performance uplift on 6800xt with xess.pretty much double performance in 4k xess performance mode vs 4k native.,so that video is not representative of xess technology.its just showing that there is some bug with 6600xt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lets be clear: *no one needs a 32 thread cpu for gaming.,"*

the 13700k is already more than most people need anyway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
get a 13600k for just gaming and use the money saved for a better gpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you have 4090 ?,otherwise buy 13600k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"13700k 

if you only plan to not upgrade for longer than 4-5 years , get 13700k or 12700k over 13600k.","on average 13600k is faster than 12700k by 5%, but in some games already you can see limitation of only 6 p cores at resolution below 4k.","the limitstion of only 6p cores will be more pronounced with years, when games may or may not use more cores.","kitguru review 13600k- watch dogs legion 1080p ultra (12700k is 20% faster)

while 13700k beats them both comfortable by 15%.","so aim for at least 8p cores, so get a 13700k.",with 13700k vs 13900k for gaming not much difference and it's just an upsell for no reason.,"money better spent somewhere else, like gpu, ram or ssd or even better monitor.","from 4k at the moment most cpu since ryzen 5000, intel 12gen and up are equal, as higher resolution cpu matter less and gpu matter the most.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13600k or 13700k is plenty enough for gaming.,13900k is great don't get me wrong but it is severely overkill for most people unless you have money to burn.,"i am a power user and gamer, even i only bought the 13700k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13600k or 13700k would be great options for you.,youâ€™re gonna be blown away by the performance increase compared to you old system.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you play star citizen?,13900k.,game loves cache.,otherwise just go for the 13600k-13700k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on the budget but the 13700k is the best value and you can use a good 280mm aio and apply a slight oc to even increase more performance.,unless the i9 is in the budget.,"beside that i recommend going for ddr5 as more applications or games benefit from the bandwidth, i upgraded from 2x16gb ddr4 3600 to 2x16gb ddr5 6000mhz and the system in overall feels alot smoother and snappier.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the 3080 ti is virtually the same as a 3090. the 3090 memory on the back is impossible to cool so the 3080 ti is honestly better.,right now the 6800xt is pretty cheap.,the 3080 12gb is a pretty good choice too.,i'd recommend one of those.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

tbh i switched from 970 evo to a 980 pro and it's much faster.,just mentioning that the 980 pro runs hotter so the components around it might also heat up a bit more.,beside that i would definitely tweak the ram as you prob can get close to 6000mhz/cl34 i guess.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"$570 at microcenter, or $550 if you buy it with a board.",itâ€™s a free market.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"wow, sold by amazon.com as well.",thatâ€™s sad.,but whatâ€™s crazy?,"amazon.ca also has this newly listed, shipped and sold by amazon.ca, for $810.43 cadâ€¦ which is $591.38 usd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have a feeling people don't know what msrp means.,"it doesn't mean they have to sell it at that, it's literally just a suggestion.",manufacturer suggested retail price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there are other ways to buy this than amazon and newegg.,i bought mine from bestbuy and used the bestbuy credit card 10% off to get it down to $620.,allowed me to get it a day after launch for basically msrp.,not everywhere is gouging on price.,just dont buy form the places that are and let the silly people do it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the msrp is not actually below 600$.,its intel's 1k bulk selling price.,that rarely stays like that for an individual product.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes it is.,itâ€™s not the bulk selling price lmao no average consumer buys in bulk.,donâ€™t be a clown.,the naming and description of the â€œrcpâ€ isnâ€™t what it sounds like it is.,itâ€™s not the â€œretailerâ€ unit pricing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"czech republic, europe.",you don't have any other retailers than newegg and amazon at your place??,that would be weird.,usually the bigger they are the higher the prices are.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"dude, youâ€™re the clown.",it is intelâ€™s bulk pricing.,"hell, they posted it in their slides when they announced the price.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on your local pricing of course.,but in general 13900k should be available cheaper than 7950x.,"amazon is greedy af, they were asking almost $400 for ryzen 5600x back in 2020",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got one at microcenter for like 560,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

personally i've bought the u12a but i've set up my case for airflow (mesh fronted lian li) and have a sensible amount of case fans (3 intake, 3 exhaust) maintaining close to neutral air pressure.",also if you go the water cooling route have fun when the pump inevitably dies and your temperatures go through the roof.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks a lot...it wiil be great if you can share your opinion after you'll manage to game a little bit

just watch the reviews.,they show how hot these cpus get.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you are correct, to an extent.","i have used my trusty old nh-u14s since 2013. first with the fx 8350, then intel 6700k oc:d, and now i want to see if it is sufficient for the 13600k.","so trust me, i am far from a water cooling fanboy.","&#x200b;

the hard truth is that the best watercooler is better than the best aircooler, simply because of transmission abilities.",you can quickly transfer all the heat from the cpu to however many radiators you want.,"with aircoolers, the tranfer speed and efficiency of metal and heat-pipes will limit them.",especially when you consider the weight.,"&#x200b;

in terms of reliability, thats a pretty moot point.","a fan failure on an aircooler is not as bad as a pump failure, but you won't damage anything anyway, and the risk is extremely small.","&#x200b;

you can make an argument for pump noise though.. 

&#x200b;

the u14s is pretty much as large as you can go.","the d14 is great, but is a bit too big tbh.","the weight of the u14s made me worry for my 6700k because of images popping up of bent pcbs, and people warning you not to ever move a skylake-gen computer with the cooler attached.","a water cooler is thus great at giving you a ton of cooling performance without taking much space, and still being easy to install.","&#x200b;

telling people to please use a dual radiator water cooler at the minimum for the 13th gen cpus is pretty good actually, as that is a safe way to go.",air coolers vary massively in performance even at the same 120mm or 140mm sizes.,"noctua just happens to be freaking awesome air coolers that can beat a lot of water coolers, but you don't tell people to buy a noctua air cooler for 13th gen.. you tell them ""at least a 140mm air cooler for 13th gen"", and that can end up with really bad results.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i jumped into a quick cod mw game this morning and the 13700k was running about 95-100 watts, 70c average on a low fan curve (quiet).",this was run on a oc 3080 at 4k max settings.,i have the cpu set with a 255w limit and all other cpu power settings at auto (haven't had time to tinker yet).,"so i'd guess as long as your case has decent airflow, your u14s will be fine.",you can always undervolt or lower the power limits as well to further reduce heat without losing much performance.,another option that might be a better fit is the 13600k.,"that has a 181 watt max turbo power limit, so you'd have no issues keeping it cool enough at max load.",reviews of it sound like it's a perfect gaming cpu.,"i went with a 13700k for other work reasons (rendering, etc.","), but it's overkill as a gaming cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">but you don't tell people to buy a noctua air cooler for 13th gen.. you tell them ""at least a 140mm air cooler for 13th gen"", and that can end up with really bad results.",currently cooling a 13700k with a u12a and it's ice cold.,only thermal throttles on a cinebench torture test and even then barely.,performance loss is between 2-3% in cinebench compared to if the thermal throttling didn't occur.,the temperature has never reached anywhere near that on any normal workload.,if your 13th gen is burning up then i suspect there's something seriously wrong with your case airflow and that's where watercooling seems to help because it bypasses a suboptimal airflow and just dumps the heat straight into the radiator and out of the case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the u12a is an exception rather than the rule.,"it is on the same level as the u14s, even outperforming it in some cases.",it's an excellent cooler.,i would bet the majority of 120mm tower coolers will not handla a 13700k.,remember a lot of people would think the cooler master 212 would suffice if the 120mm noctua cooler handles it so well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>remember a lot of people would think the cooler master 212 would suffice if the 120mm noctua cooler handles it so well.,fair point.,people need to do their research regarding cooling though just like research is needed regarding other parts of building a computer.,even the best air coolers suck (or don't suck enough to be more accurate?),when the case itself has poor airflow.,"ideally you want a case with enough of a gap between the front of the case and the fans for them to draw in maximum air (mesh helps but a mesh case is not necessarily good just by itself, check the clearance on the front intake fans, you'd be surprised how many case manufacturers of 'airflow' cases smother the hell out of them so they can jam the fans as close to the front as possible to blind you with their rgb trash) and you want definitely 2-3 strong intake fans as well as 2-3 strong exhaust fans.","heck i've even seen some extremely dumb stuff like people mounting their cpu cooler backwards and exhausting to the front of the case, into the intake fans (to be fair, for a newbie fan orientation is counter-intuitive, you would think that the pretty side of the fan would face towards the front of the case) or even shoving the back of the computer with the single exhaust up against a wall providing no clearance.","this is not even getting into negative/positive pressure which can effect cooling performance via dust buildup if not factored in for or maintained properly (probably the one area i screwed up, i think the case has slight negative pressure due to slightly better quality exhaust fans).",cooling is a lot more complicated than just slapping a few more $5 fans in.,"quality, orientation and clearance all matter.","however if you factor in for all of this then air cooling is better than all but the beefiest and most expensive aios (custom blocks/loops are in another league obviously) with the advantage of being way, way, way more durable (and if they ever do fail... the fans at least because if your metal tower fails then what the heck exactly did you do?",much cheaper to replace).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the lazy way to fix this is simply go into the asus bios and enable multicore enhancement.,this is enabled by default on their maximus line but i guess not on the strix?,also are you on the latest bios?,if not update to that then enabled multicore enhancement and xmp i. set your fans and you should be good to go.,all multicore enhancement does today is set long and short term power limits to 4095. you can also do this manually if you wish.,i would also max out the cpu current limit.,all of this can be found in the extreme tweaker tab.,also get rid of intel xtu or any other overclocking software.,do your long term overclocks in the bios.,if you want to do a bit of real time tweaking then get the latest version of turbov.,can probably find this on overclockers.net forums under intel motherboards â€” z790 posts for asus should have software links to 13th gen compatible software.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

which games?,depending on the game the 12100 may show a pretty decent uplift in cpu bound situations even over the 10400f/11400f.,if they are games that use more threads well the 10400f will be a lot closer to the 12100.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"what iâ€™m reading says 2.3 is the one with minimum load changes for cpus with low power startup, and 2.4 is nothing significant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think the 13900k goes to 5.8ghz only in single tasks not in scenarios like gaming.the all core boost for a 13900k seems to be 5.5ghz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the raw increase in cpu horsepower is nuts.,single threaded difference between those skylakex cores and raptor cove cores are north of 60% faster on raptor lake.,a comment below shows r23 score of 1281 for a 4.2ghz 7980xe and 2271 for a 13900k.,even the e cores in the new intel parts approach the ipc of those skylake x cores.,(although at lower clock speeds.,as to if it will actually impact framerates.,i think your best bet would be to look at some zen2 benchmarks as that seems to be the closest comparison that was usually tested in gaming as your cpu was prosumer only.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"btw, for gaming 13700k will give you the same performance as 13900k but it's cheaper.","games use only p-cores, booth i7 and i9 have 8 p-ores.",the 200mhz difference in clock speed is very tiny.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my bad, but would the 5,5 ghz make a big difference compared to 4,5 ?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
stop comparing frequencies.,"itâ€™s meaningless, especially between different generations of cpus.","at stock (4.2ghz), your 7980xe gets a single threaded r23 score of 1281 (granted, this will be higher overclocked).","but a stock 13900k gets a single threaded score of 2271.

if things scaled linearly, your 7980xe would have to run at 7.4ghz to equal the 13900kâ€™s single threaded score.","now, the 7980xe is an absolute beast for multithreaded workloads.","but for gaming, single threaded performance is more important, so any 13th gen cpu would likely do better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mate the e cores only underclocked to 3 ghz would still be better lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this right here!!,it's not just about the frequency,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i thought it was weird the thing was locked to a flat 2000 mhz when doing anything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what does hwinfo show?,i noticed it showed different numbers than gpu-z for some stuff.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got this on my a750 too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wonder if this is related to the performance tuning sliders disappearing from arc control.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"rocking a 9700k and 2080 super, will be upgrading in a few days or weeks.",bought my 13700k for pre-sale of 419$.,not sure if it will drop more than that so i jumped it.,also heard a lot of folks saying to shoot for ddr5 as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i get my 13700k tomorrow.,been running a 9700k with my 3080ti for a year now at 1440p and in some games like bf2042 sometimes i drop to 70fps which when you game 144hz at 1440p its just not doing it for me when a game runs with low fps.,mw 2019 campaign i get 170fps max with ray tracing off.,the new one i'm at around 130 ish to 150. now i know it's not cpu intensive however when i play ground war on 2019 or warzone my frames weren't great so i had to lower settings just to try and get close to my 140 frames.,i'm hoping this jump allows me to play ground war and warzone with a bit more graphical detail as i do personally think the multiplayer side must be a cpu bottleneck with all the calculations on having so many players running g around the big maps.,i will keep you updated after a few days and once the multiplayer on mw2 is released at the weekend.,edit: forgot to mention the only reason i think this way is my friend who i game with regular he has a 10900k and a 2080ti and gets 120fps upwards on bf2042 and it is to my knowledge that a 13700k is faster in gaming than a 12900k so i hope i see some reasonable jumps in cpu intensive games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
getting generic ddr4 memory with the 13700k would waste a good chunk of its performance.,iâ€™d go with 5600 or higher ddr5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you're getting new ddr4 ram with a 13700k, get 3600 or higher.",the advantage of gear 1 ddr4 is that you can run the imc at rates that require $400 ddr5-8000 to hit with only $140 ddr4-4000.,this will help with gaming performance while not being that much more expensive than ddr4-3200.,at least get 3600 which is only $10 more than 3200 for 32gb,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all the benchmark videos i have seen so far all indicate ddr5 won't make some massive difference to warrant the price of the mobo's and ram sticks.,what i have seen others say is that ddr5 is at least still a couple years wait.,so for the 13700k whenever i get it i will more than likely pair it with 32gb 3600 ddr4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ah yes forgot to say i will also be going from 16gb to 32gb since 16 isn't really viable anymore (for me).,"anyways, i consider myself somewhat knowledgeable when it comes to working my way with a pc but this is the first i am hearing about gear 1 and all that a quick google led me to somewhat understand?",i think?,but essentially get 3600 to match with the cpu.,"i'll see if i can find something to work with, currently have $650 to spend on all of this so its kind of tight hence the inquiry on seeing if the holidays will actually have a sale.",(though once i get the cpu/mobo/ram i will probably just sell the old three all at once for whatever price to recoup.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in general ddr5 results in a substantial uplift in 1% lows https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/y5u283/is_ddr5_worth_it/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to support ddr5-8000+, the memory controller can run in a geared mode where parts of it runs slower.","the base imc clock can go over 2000mhz but to hit ddr5-8000 the memory interface itself would need to run at 4000mhz, so there is almost a 2000mhz shortfall if the entire memory subsystem were clocked at the same rate.","this is why ddr5 runs in gear 2.

but for ddr4, you don't need the gearing so you can run the controller, phy, and ddr4 in 1:1:1 mode which allows you to max out the memory controller clock.","if you get 3200 instead of 3600/4000, your memory controller will be running at 1600 instead of 1800/2000",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ddr4 is not worth buying now!,ddr4 13th gen is just for people who already have high end ddr4 kits!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i see, so what would one do to get that 1:1:1 mode you're talking about?",all that i have been doing for years is just enabling xmp in bios and calling it a day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all the benchmark videos i have seen so far all indicate ddr5 won't make some massive difference to warrant the price of the mobo's and ram sticks.,what i have seen others say is that ddr5 is at least still a couple years wait.,so for the 13700k whenever i get it i will more than likely pair it with 32gb 3600 ddr4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thats only for 11th gen onwards.,pre 11th gen there was no gears.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very bad move.,"all those sites only use stock xmp, usually 3600cl16 vs 6000cl32.","the one site that tried 4000cl14 had it running in gear 2.

you can buy 2x16 gb ddr5 hynix ic for the same price currently as 2x16 3600cl16.",that ddr5 when correctly oced and tuned to 7000+ and tighter timings will outperform tuned ddr4.,tuned ddr5 > tuned ddr4 > anything at stock xmp.,13th gen ddr4 boards are only advisable at current ram prices if you already have high end ddr4.,otherwise a ddr5 board with hynix ic and manual overclock is better and the same price or just $10-30 more as new ddr4.,"you will then also be able to upgrade the ddr5 further when 8000+ is released, ddr4 you are stuck.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i see, so is that something you have to manually do in the bios alongside xmp or would that automatically be done when you enable xmp?",just so i know what to do when i install everything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well the benchmarks i was referring to were mostly youtube channels who focus on tech and such.,"as to the prices all that i am finding of ddr5 mobo/ram will seriously run up the price and is really expensive, i've been checking all the standard places such as newegg, amazon, microcenter, etc.",for cpu/mobo/ram/psu i am working with $650.,"though i don't even know if i want to buy a new psu because i would just be going from 850w non-modular to 850w fully modular, since my current one has thick ugly cables and is nearing 10 years old.","(1000w would probably be preferred but again, price).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it is, as per your other replies, ddr4 is comparable to high end ddr5 only if you are willing to tune and oc it in the bios.","if you don't know how to do this / dont want to, its better to get the best xmp profile ram you can afford.","however, its not worth overspending on ram, if the next one up is $10-20 thats ok. if it $50+, its not worth it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i took the time to put together what my pc currently has through pcpartpicker minus some things that i either couldn't find or can't recall what it is exactly.,[https://pcpartpicker.com/b/vqp2ft](https://pcpartpicker.com/b/vqp2ft),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just to point out we are discussing this thoroughly on actual 'tech' forums like ocnet.,"these 'tech' youtube channels are a joke, they dumb everything down and none of them have configured the ram properly.","if you're looking at oc3ds video, thats the worst of the lot, the ddr4 was only running in gear 2 so its imc latency would be halved, and comparing 4000cl14 which is like the best ddr4 can do against plain 6000cl32 ddr5 is an unfaair comparison.","to buy new 4000cl14 ddr4, you have to spend way too much money 6000cl32 ddr5 is cheap.",3600cl16 costs the same as getting good ics on cheaper ddr5 and manually overclocking to top tier.,"i've personally pointed this out to oc3d in several comments, they reply with 'we just run the settings people would at home because gears is too confusing'.",their tests and everything is dumbed down to the point that their advice is basically like building an office pc to run msword.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i can see that haha.,as to the ram are you able to link any that would beat this?,[https://www.amazon.com/dp/b08tr1bqm3?tag=pcpapi-20&linkcode=ogi&th=1&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/dp/b08tr1bqm3?tag=pcpapi-20&linkcode=ogi&th=1&psc=1) i know its cl18 but i think i can tighten the timings a little bit.,"or i just stick with 3600, i don't know my brain is exploding and parts are expensive, i don't know if i'm just not filtering right but i just see expensive parts everywhere.",seems like its just better to just call it a day with ddr4 3600mhz for $90 than ddr5 5600mhz or + for way more.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"unfortunately i haven't kept track of which kit has which chips on ddr5, just that you dont want 5200 because the are all micron and oc the worst, and hynix chips are the best.","theres two types on the hynix, m and a die.","one clocks higher with looser timings, the other runs a bit slower but with much better timings, both are about the same when tuned.","samsung ddr5 is middle ground, not as bad as micron, but not as good as hynix.","this ofc will change when newer ddr5 is made, but for now hynix chips are the best.","there are some 4800 and 6000 kits that have it, but they are starting to phase out the 4800 as loads of people are buying them and getting 7000+ ocs.",but not all 4800 are hynix.,"you would have to ask on a new thread somewhere, or ask on a decent tech forum like ltt or ocnet to confirm which have hynix chips.","in general kingsron use hynix, g skill use samsung, crucial use micron, but there are some g skill kits with hynix and not all kingston might have it.","only way to confirm is by checking from people who already bought the same kit, you can only tell which chips ram has after checking in taiphoon burner.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the case is a corsair 5000d airflow with mesh on top and front.","it also had front, top, and rear dust filters too.",i painted the psu cover white as well as the area behind the motherboard so usually these are all black or all white.,"i tried quite a few cases in the last few years and found these to be really good for airflow and can be used for aios, custom watercooling, or cpu aircoolers because of the layout and options they have.",corsair makes a 4000d and 7000d as well.,the 4000d is slighly smaller and doesnt have side case fans in it and the 7000d is a full tower and among the biggest cases corsair makes with tons of room for everything.,i would recommend looking into youtube videos on the 5000d and seeing how it is from that perspective as well.,the front mesh panels are solid metal and click into clips easily if you ever never or want to clean the dust filters.,the desk mat i got from bestbuy last blackfriday for around $15.,it's a corsair - mm300 pro.,very nice extended long desk mat and has held up very well compared to some others i have had from amazon.,if you have any other questions feel free to ask!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes.,two ml140's on top just mounted above the bracket so you dont see them when looking at the case.,i had a 280 aio on top as exhaust but wanted a 360 on the side so i can get more exhaust flow out of the case and fresh air into the aio rather than having it on top as exhaust like it was prior.,i have a 140 ml as the rear exhaust too.,found a way to mount it just barely clearing the io shield which is awesome!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hi!,i had a 12700k previously on this that i am planning on putting into my office pc.,was only going to upgrade if bestbuy price match microcenter which they did and i had alot of cashback from my card and online sites so it made it come out to be just over what i would have paid for a new 12700k they had on sale.,haven't had much time to mess with it today for performance difference wise as i had so much to do but seemed slightly hotter on idle and in games but only a few degrees.,waiting on the cod mw2 release to see how it really performs later next week.,youtube had some good comparisons on the two generations that were very helpful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had a 12700k briefly in it before this as i was hoping to just swap that to an office pc i wanted to build and get a 12900k for my gaming when the price on that dropped.,then i heard 13th gen was launching and figured i would just get the 13700k when it launched and put that 12700k in an upcoming pc build for the office.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i only did because i got bestbuy to price match microcenter which was 399. with cashback on my card and on a cb site it came out to be $370 after tax.,i usually wait for sales around blackfriday but figured i would just take the pricematch.,i am always hunting for deals/coupons on everything i can.,saved a good $40 in gas having to drive to microcenter too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'm using an 240mm arctic liquid freezer ii but i don't think it's really the aio.,the cpu is sitting pegged at 5.3ghz even when idle and setting power limits doesn't seem to affect it.,if it was working with the written base speed (3.8?),"and boosting to 5.4ghz when needed, it wouldn't be an issue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, that seems to be an asus tool and i'm using an msi z690-a pro board.",be interested to hear if it helps for you since it would at least help confirm where the problem is at.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you're super welcome!,and thanks!,"i really enjoy messing with it, constantly taking it apart to change parts or paint panels for it haha 

i didn't get into pc stuff until about 4 years ago so i know exactly what your learning about and glad your asking questions first/learning this stuff even if it is somewhat overwhelming to some.",the 5000d basically is slightly bigger in all dimensions than the 4000d.,i use side fans in it now to bring cool air in from the outside of the back of the case through the aio radiator by those red fans into the case.,i had before this those red fans just pulling in fresh air into the case along with the blue ones doing the same.,then having the rear/top exhausting it.,its definitely a feature some use and some don't on the 5000d and 7000d.,my friend had a 4000d system i built him and wanted a bigger case so he could fit an aio so i upgraded him to a 5000d but he didn't want to buy rear fans so we left the panel on that covers the area where the 3 side fans mount and his system performs just around the same as mine temperature wise.,there also is extra noise from the and yes extra airflow but some of it is lost in turbulence from the front fans pushing air the opposite direction.,the 5000d cases don't technically support 3 140mm front intake fans but i have found you can easily get them to work/fit if you use some pcie fan brackets from amazon on the middle fan/bottom fan.,then with three 140mm fans  you get the most airflow you can in the front of the system vs 3 120s or 2 140s there and less noise than 3 120mm's wouild be since the bigger the fan the less rpm you need to turn to push the same amount of air as a smaller fan which means less noise.,heres a helpful page i found comparing the two cases.,"[https://forum.corsair.com/blog/cases/4000-5000-series-case-comparison/#:\~:text=4000%20%26%205000%20series%20case%20comparison%20%20,tray%3a%203%20...%20%2012%20more%20rows%20](https://forum.corsair.com/blog/cases/4000-5000-series-case-comparison/#:~:text=4000%20%26%205000%20series%20case%20comparison%20%20,tray%3a%203%20...%20%2012%20more%20rows%20)

in regards to positive/negative pressure i personally like positive pressure.",the more fresh air incoming into the case i can get i try to do.,"i also have a few fans for exhaust too to exhaust the air quickly once its heated up by a air cooler, radiator, gpu, motherboard components, ssds, etc.",so in my build here i have 3 120 red fans as intake and 3 blue 140s as intake.,the 3 reds are attached to the aio and pull air from outside the case through it cooling the processor but warming that air coming through and thats being pushed out in the case by those bigger 140s that have nothing but fresh air from outside the case and no obsticales (other than a dust filter) to slow the air coming in like the 3 120s on the aio do.,now my gpu needs air to cool the heatsink on it and pull the heat from the hintsink so the fans on the gpu turn on when its hot and push air out of the fins on the heatsink into the case too.,the exhaust fans i have are 1 rear 140 and 2 top 140s (which are kind of hard to see but are also blue) those then suck that hot that naturally rises out of the case via the top and rear.,"so, for me because positive airflow works well to cool my pc parts and works with the natural rise of heat up and out of the case thats why i have it like this and use it this way.",if you have all positive in this particular case and took the top 2 140 fans and made them intake into the case and the rear as an intake there would be too no way for heat to escape easily.,the torrent case is mainly all positive pressure and only works like that with one rear exhaust because the two front fans are massive 180mm fans along with bottom intake fans people can add.,the front fans make so much pressure it literally just pushing air through the case so fast and they have holes cutout in the rear side of the case to help air flow out of the case fast without having air get stuck/trapped.,i just dont prefer those layouts not because of the two big front fans which i really like but because the psu is top mounted and intakes air from the case which is often hotter than the psu taking air in from outside the case to cool it like it would normally.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in my experience too there is always sales for the latest i7 a month or two after release that is like a flash sale so even if you wait thinking about it you may find one might pop up that might swade you because of the deal.,i check the slickdeals website and buildapc sales on reddit for good deals on processors/pc parts and found alot of intel sales on there through the years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

oh sorry about that!,i would guess msi would have an me update as well on their board pages but from checking on it for your motherboard it seems their last update was on 5.10.22 for the management engine.,"i just tried it now and at first it wouldnt launch, then i had to download the intel chipset driver for it to launch, updated the me and still nothing changed.",if i look in hardware info 64 it states my cpu is at 4.75ghz but that doesnt fluctuate much at all which is very odd too.,hopefully its just a bios bug that can be fixed quickly or a windows issue that needs a patch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
see if your on balanced power plan or high performance.,"i switched from high performance to balanced and it seemed to let the clocks on all cores ""unfreeze"" from max where they were since startup to normal fluctuating values now for me.",i did that after some comments on another subforum and updated the latest intel me which you might have to get from msi.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
problem with a bigger monitor is it's flat.,i tried this and went back to multiple monitors because it was not angled towards me.,i ended up sliding from side to side when i needed to look at a different window.,"big curved monitor would be ok, just expensive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why is that hard to believe?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i bought my 12700k for 340â‚¬ on release (due to usd its now still 460â‚¬ in shops and intel does not do discounts in eu with new gen).,"sold it for 410â‚¬ and bought 13700kf for 420â‚¬, as i know all promotions in all shops in multiple country.",being a beneficent of a certain banks gives me a big discount.,so upgraded to 13gen for 10â‚¬.,did same for my friend with his 12600k to 13600kf.,only got kf versions cause k was out of stock in the shop i had promotion in.,"will have to wait 2 months for next wave, will probably get k version and sell kf with profit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i can play but iâ€™m not reaching 100fps in the games,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s a hell of an assumption considering the insane uplift already seen in the 4090,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"because when a new gen arrives, the old one gets discounted.",and selling an already used discounted old  processor at close new one is not credible.,"i  did it with my i7 7700k and sold the 6700k but i lost half its value doing the real numbers, and the 8700k which is already w11 compatible would have been a better upgrade.","tah is my experience, perhaps you found someone who paid almost  as much for a used old gen as a new one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"again, what games?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s much less of an assumption than it seems.,look at how absurdly gimped every card below the 4090 is compared to it.,"in terms of shader count, the 4080 16gb is to the 4090 what the 3070 is to the 3090, and the recently â€œunlaunchedâ€ 4080 12gb had a shader count relative to the 4090 that was 3060 ti-esque.","and then, look at what nvidia did last gen, how they kept their entire lineup above msrp for two whole years despite most of those msrps being horrible to begin with, and how the 3060 ti was the cheapest ampere card that was actually decent value.","itâ€™s crystal-clear what their plan for the gpu market is: the people who are willing to pay them $1000+ for the pleasure get the big generational uplifts, and everyone else gets either 10-20% or nothing at all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
search ebay or craigslist for prices.,itâ€™s not like itâ€™s big secret.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean itâ€™s obviously an assumption without seeing the cards be released and tested.,not to mention how comparable the amd cards we priced on release to their nvidia counterparts and having no idea what their pricing will be like for this gen. a lot as gone into the price increase 2 years after the release of last gen. i donâ€™t know about nvidia keeping their lineup above msrp.,if iâ€™m not mistaken founders cards were the only cards that stayed consistently prices and as far as i know partners set their own prices,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i just have seen the video and i think i will install that one, it's cheaper and similar to the nh15.",i was considering installing the nh-12ua or 15s which both are a little bit worse than nh15 and ak620.,"moreover, they sell the cooler in white and my case will be white so another positive thing i guess haha",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"while that's true for that benchmark it's worth pointing out that:

1. benchmarks are variable depending on the system and environment its in and there are a number of benchmarks where the nh-d15 beats out the ak620:

example 1 - [https://youtu.be/ryo7tkflin0?t=111](https://youtu.be/ryo7tkflin0?t=111)

example 2 - [https://youtu.be/ugm6fcldckk?t=988](https://youtu.be/ugm6fcldckk?t=988)

admittedly the nh-d15 only beats out the ak620 in these benchmarks by a few degrees, but it does beat it.",2. while both the nh-d15 and the ak620 beat the nh-u12a by \~1-3 degrees you also have to consider the unique advantage of the nh-u12a.,"the nh-u12a has full compatibility with all ram whereas both the nh-d15 and the ak620 block ram of a certain height (you can jimmy the fan facing the ram up or remove it, but at this point the nh-u12a will perform better).",3. while not a deal-breaker for me the ak620 is by far the loudest of the three options.,where the ak620 does have a distinct advantage is in it's incredible price for its performance.,"so i'd say:

if you want the best cooling at any cost go the nh-d15.",if you want the best performance per dollar and the acoustics don't bother you go the ak620.,if you're willing to sacrifice a few degrees (we're talking between 1 to 3 degrees according to most benchmarks) for ram compatibility go the nh-u12a.,personally i'll be cooling my 13700k on a nh-u12a.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ok so afaik those 13th gen chips are made to run pretty hot but generally having 100c for a few hours on cpu might shorten it lifespan - in worst case scenario you will toast your processor but in most cases thermal throttling will happen (cpu will downclock itself to keep ""safe"" temp).",thermal throttling reduces cpu performance - it's a safety mechanism.,for maximum performance you want to be just a little bit below 100c.,but to be honest in gaming you will not push this cpu to max anytime soon i can guarantee this.,also few years ago those temperature could be deadly for cpu but now it's a bit different.,for now it's hard to say anything more - those cpu's reach 100c and it supposed to be normal but we need 2-3 year to really see if it's safe.,i personally don't want to go above 90c on my cpu - i am an oldtimer and i just fell mentally safer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's one piece of anecdotal evidence vs every benchmark on the internet (at least all of the ones i've seen).,as i said before some things matter more to some people than others.,"if you're a streamer or content creator with an excellent microphone for example, having a lot of ambient background noise becomes a big issue pretty fast.","don't assume because it doesn't bother you (or me in this case) it isn't worth mentioning to others, it may very well bother them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the kf doesn't have an integrated gpu, that's the only difference.",other than that they are the exact same.,if it's overkill depends especially on the resolution.,probably even a 12400f would be fine but having a more powerful cpu for when you upgrade the gpu isn't necessarily a had thing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

both the cpu and gpu need to be tweaked to use less power.,don't run either at stock settings.,tech yes city on youtube might give you some ideas for the 4090.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you can undervolt both the cpu and gpu and basically get as low as you want with power consumption, and the performance hit won't even be that big.","it depends on how far you go of course but running lower voltages is always more efficient, so even if you lose performance you will have more performance per watt.","the 13700 and 4090 are newer and thus have better efficiency, meaning that if you configure the parts to draw the same power they will certainly outperform the older system by a significant margin.","by default the 4090 should draw around 100w more than the 3090, while both the 13700k and 9900k should draw beetween 250w and 300w at full load, but it depends on how the motherboard sets the power limits.",all this doesn't really matter since you can manually tune everything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it should definitely be, tuning pl has often offered efficiency gains on recent intel cpu's especially when also undervolting so it can make better use of the power available.","after having a watch, i did some testing on the 12700k out of curiosity, each is a single cinebench r23 pass (so don't compare score in the video as it's r20 but it could be used as a rough efficiency scaling guide for the 12700k).","&#x200b;

|pl|voltage|average power|max package temp|score|points/w|relative performance|relative efficiency|

notes:   
all tests were with vcore voltage mode ""adaptive + offset"", 0 offset is ""auto"" on my board so i conducted a -10mv test to verify that it wasn't doing something too silly as i never trust auto on motherboards.","relative performance and efficiency is relative to the bolded 190w ""stock"" line, relative efficiency compares points/w.","&#x200b;

the 12700k can get quite substantial efficiency improvements  sacrificing only 25% performance for a 75% improvement in efficiency @ 80w, personally the configuration i use is the 288w pl with -125mv offset as it offers no noticeable performance degradation and a significant improvement in power use and thermals.","using der bauer's and my numbers as a very rough guide i think it's likely that the 13700k will offer substantial efficiency gains especially when undervolted and constrained by a pl, it may offer even more when both underclocked and undervolted as i feel that if you can use voltage/multi to constrain it then the pl largely becomes irrelevant (as you can see with my 288w results that most the time 135w was enough to sustain stock boost clocks with an undervolt happily).","as to if it's worth it for an upgrade, that's totally up to you and your use case, but i think you've got the right idea and that waiting on more numbers so that you can be sure is the way to go, i wish i had a 13700k on hand because i'd have happily run a few more tests so that we could get a definitive answer on if it is or isn't but hopefully that's a few useful data points :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i just got in my 4090fe to replace my 3080ti, after seeing der bauer's vid, i figured the 13900k vs the 13700k with the price difference, doing the same trick to the 13700k makes it price efficient and very power and heat efficient as well, i would not have to worry about the 4090 bottle-necking my cpu and that combo should ride any games i play at 4k 144hz for quite some time.","as you can see from my case choice, putting in a aio just defeats the purpose, so i went air for the first time  in 4 builds.. it is working well, and should on the 13700k if i can do the same power limiting, or that is my thoughts anyway.","&#x200b;

thank you kindly :).,nice rig!,that'll be a fun upgrade especially for 4k 144hz!,"yeah honestly the 13700k is probably the sensible choice (in the same situation i'd probably not be so sensible ðÿ¤£), it's definitely a much better balance of price/performance.",yeah your case does look quite good with a cooler like that in it so i can totally understand why you'd go that route.,good to hear!,"you should be right to limit the power, usually it's the kind of setting you can just throw at it and it usually just works with no other tweaks/tuning or testing required beyond performance testing, with any luck that'll be the same with a 13700k (i don't imagine it'll change).",i'd probably look into undervolting too as a combination of those two seems to compliment each other quite well from an efficiency standpoint.,"undervolting i expect is less likely to harm performance but is more likely to harm stability if you go to far with it (prime95 small fft's are your friend for testing this), i haven't seen any results with regard to undervolting a 13700k but with any luck they'll be as happy to do so as 12th gen as many 12700k's are happy with -100mv.","the board i'm running is an msi z690-a pro ddr4 wifi, it's running a ddr4 3600 c18 kit (so nothing too special memory wise), cooler is a lian li galahad 360, and i'm not using a contact frame.","fan profiles are noise optimised (my psu is louder), and the fan exhausts over the rad (so is suboptimal for cpu cooling).",sorry i should have included those details in the original post.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'd put 3 intake front fans and place the cpu cooler as exhaust at top.,but you could play around with different configs to see which one results in optimal cpu and gpu thermals.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thanks for the answer!","i'm going from a very old cpu, intel(r) core(tm) i7-3930k cpu @ 3.20ghz to the 13900k.",the performance difference turning off mce and caping p1 and p2 values will have no significant impact.,it will still be a big performance boost overall from my old system.,so i will definitely start off with my noctua fan and turn off these settings to see how it holds up.,"then in the future when i do my next upgrade, like switching out for a new fresh psu and a gtx3080-3090 / gtx4080 (depending on upcoming reviews, pricing and stock).",at that same time i might install an aio as well and re-use my fan on my old cpu/mobo in my htpc.,it's not that i'm against aio.,i would love to have a more compact cooler instead of the bulky noctua but i figured i can hold the investment and focus on other components that will give me more joy than perhaps a 5 to 10c lower temp on a cpu that is still within a good range.,but we'll see after i have asembled the entire build.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah it was recommended to me from a forum that they offer lga1700 brackets.,simply contacted noctua and they sent one to me completely free (even shipping) within 2 days as long as i could prove original receipt of the noctua fan and an order for a lga1700 mobo or 13th gen cpu.,:),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the reply.,the case i bought was the asus tuf 501 which only supports up to 360mm radiator.,will the 80mm give that much of a difference?,i have always been a bit scared of water cooling based on the previous complexity of it but with the new aio it seems really nice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks!,really nice build!,i recently purchased the tuf 501 case that will be the one i use for this.,i will keep the orignal fans for now and leave the top spot empty in case i decide on the aio cooler.,but mounting more fans is definitely something i will consider as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it will make a difference in time taken to fully saturate the loop, as well as the amount of heat that can be dissipated by the loop, however i can't quantify the difference between the 360 and 420. i would guess a few c, maybe 5, give or take a few.",quality aio choice and fan choice matter a lot.,i personally run the arctic because it has a vrm cooling fan and it also has a slightly thicker radiator than any other brands.,it also has received the highest marks from gamers nexus.,"my fan choice is noctua 3000rpm industrial fans, obviously on a custom curve where they don't typically need to exceed 1500rpm, but have headroom if needed.",the arctic 360 is a great choice and comes in quite a bit cheaper than any other option in the same size.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

lock it at 253w which is the intel suggested stock value.,you'll lose less than 5% mt performance.,it's really pointless/stupid to run these cpus unlimited.,unlimited power is good only if you wanna use ur pc as a heat blower for some reason.,:d :d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you thought about getting the 12th gen contact frame first?,it should work and i haven't seen anyone mention it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you could lock it to 250w, still stellar performance and way easier to cooler",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

fail never again,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
one of the issues that people were running into with the uneven ilm pressure on lga1700 was inconsistent xmp speed stability.,"if the cpu was getting uneven pressure, it could cause higher xmp speeds to fail.","it might be a long shot in your example, but thought i would suggest it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i always opt for k sku because you never know when a gpu could die on you.,at least with the integrated graphics you can boot to desktop and use your computer until you get a replacement gpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
choose k so your system can use the encoders / decoders in the integrated graphics in a program that supports it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
kf has a non-functional igpu.,thatâ€™s why itâ€™s slightly cheaper than the k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'll be power limiting my chip to 90w.,should be air cooled just fine with that target,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am air cooling my 13900k with a u12a.,with no power limit i maxed out at 68 degrees in cpu heavy games but during multithreaded benchmarks eventually thermal throttled.,with a 200w power limit the cpu package temp now maxes out at 82 degrees while running burnintest and is considerably lower than that during actual use.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"have you tried to set the power limit to 253w, the stock intel value?",does it also throttle during heavy multi-thread load?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1. lock cpu power at 253w which is intel suggested stock power limit.,"2. enjoy, with capable dual-tower air cooler you won't touch 100â°c even at maximum load so no temperature throttling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

was doing some tests earlier and managed to get a -0.05 undervolt going with performance increased in cinebench.,i donâ€™t play cyberpunk but most games itâ€™s the gpu that gets toasty rather than the cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on the motherboard.,for asus its mce that removes the limits and in some other motherboards they give you presets with defined power limits.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
definitely.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can cool 13900k on air with noctua cooler without thermal throttling easily.,"just set the damn power limit at 253w, not unlimited!!",there's a really small difference in performance between 253w and unlimited anyway.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea cyber punk hits the cpu pretty hard tbh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's interesting.,could you elaborate more on the performance hit and some temp numbers ?,i'm confused because i'm running 13600k with a good 240mm aio on the msi z790 mobo and after just 3 minutes in cinebench i'm hitting 97 degrees and power meter indicating 335w from the socket.,my case is brand new with good airflow- be quiet 500dx.,intel was saying that max tdp will be at 181 w,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">just 3 minutes in cinebench i'm hitting 97 degrees and power meter indicating 335w from the socket

335w is way too high for 13600k unless you're overclocking and/or setting an llc that's pushing too much voltage or something.","msi boards are known for having excessively high voltages under stock configs, but my 13700k is on an msi z790 and it only wanted \~255w out of the box in cinebench (with power limits disabled and only the slightest thermal throttling on my d15, just randomly dropping multipliers by 1x)

i'd start by grabbing hwinfo (latest beta 7.31) if you don't have it and going to sensors, check the vcore voltage while running cinebench (not core vid, but actual ""vcore"" under the motherboard heading in the long list of sensors).",my experience with this bios so far has been buggy in terms of voltage behavior.,could be worth doing a reset to defaults and just turning on xmp to see how it behaves with no tweaking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

saying that any intel core processor is old somehow seems wrong to me considering how little has changed between different generations.,"when i was young, cpu performance increased significantly between cpu generations (at first core frequency, then number of cores).","if i bought a new desktop now, neither the number of cores nor the core frequency would be much different from the haswell cpu i have in my desktop now.","sure, the feature size is smaller and as a result they have been able to cram more instruction set extensions into the isa and increase power efficiency, but you don't get perceivable performance increases anymore like you did in the 90s.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thanks !,i play guitar through my computer now exclusively.,got rid of all my amplifiers.,much cleaner setup and i can achieve any sound i want.,part of the reason i upgraded was to try to get as little latency as possible when i was running some effects through some of the programs i use to play.,so the efficiency cores were a big draw.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
those right angle cables arenâ€™t available until october 31st as far as i know,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s a solid motherboard .. i kind of overpay for every build but i donâ€™t use half the features or professionally over clock.,i came from a maximus extreme e-atx which is an amazing board but that form factor makes every case cable management useless since it covers up the grommets.,i would say before you buy a motherboard look at what kind of ram it supports so you can future proof there.,look at the fan or rgb headers if you need anything specific there.,network connectivity do you need 10g or wifi 6e things like that.,most important thing for me was how many m2 drives can i have with no pcie lanes being affected at the gpu.,i donâ€™t run any sata drives at all anymore.,if you wonâ€™t run crazy voltages and play with deep bios settings you wonâ€™t notice a difference at all.,half of the accessories that came with my extreme card are still in the box.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

they're the uni fans right?,al or sl?,"i've also ordered an al120 triple pack but i still have some doubts, i hope you don't mind me hijacking your thread to ask them.",1. can you control them using the motherboard software?,in my case it is msi center.,all of my current rgb setup is controlled by msi center so it would be a bummer if i will need separate software just for the fans.,2. can you connect other fans to the uni fan controller which comes with the triple pack?,"my case is the lancool 2 mesh and it has three normal lian li 3 pin case fans, presently their rgb is connected to one of two 5v argb headers i have in my motherboard, the other one being occupied by the pumps argb cable.","so i do not have any more 5v headers to plug in the al120s, so if i can just connect the case fans to the controller too and then plug the controller end to the motherboard that would save me from a headache.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you mean pushing out vs pulling in lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"your bottom, side & back fans are all pushing air out instead of in.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you are correct .. took this picture while i was trying to play with the configuration.,also i wish lian li would our airflow markers on because i have a very hard time telling the air direction.,i had to read a bunch of posts before i figured it out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my buddy is an insurance adjuster and he has this really high end thermal camera they use to check for water damage in ceilings.,we put it on the computer case for fun.,not a perfect science but i could see most of the hotter air looking for a way out almost asap out the back.,the cooler air being sucked in almost looks like it overwhelming itâ€™s ability to linger around.,if you like this case check out the gamers nexus review of it.,most folks on reddit who have the same case seem to run the same fan methodology and it works well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
honestly not worth it at all if you already have a 4090. iâ€™m getting smooth 70-80 fps in 4k will everything turned up.,dlss in quality.,thatâ€™s what i had before on my 11900k.,for my flight simulator stuff on prepar3d and msfs2020 is where i saw an insane improvement.,also with general things like unzipping files or recording i saw a huge boost in performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love it .. i play mostly through neural dsp plugins.. have you tried any ?,love meeting a fellow musician.,what type of music are you influenced by ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the air always moves from the front of the fan to the back of the fan.,there are very few fans on the market with reverse airflow and they are marketed as such.,most fans will also have a small arrow on the side the shows the direction of the airflow.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have about 70-90 with psycho rt and dlss quality on a 5800x and 4090. im just interested in what happens in the markets behind tom's diner.,"for me, that place just eats the cpu and lowers gpu usage to 70-80% and fps drops to around 50-55. that's kinda the only wrinkle i'm having with cp2077.",that and places similar to it.,if anyway possible can you give me and idea what happens for you there?,not thinking of only upgrading for cp but its one point of interest.,playing on a c9 myself.,edit: it is painful to find good comparisons between cpu's + 4090 and 4k results.,it feels like its one of the 1st gpu's where 4k cpu pefromance is actually really starting to matter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

okay i got a 13700k with ddr5 memory today and it eliminated all bottlenecks i had in cyberpunk.,my gpu is on 99% usage all the time now and there are no dips.,what an amazing cpu!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what's up with the 10900k at 4.5ghz?,isn't 4.9ghz all core where it should be,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dam... not bad by the 10900k.,still holds up.,i have 10700k which is oc to 5.2ghz on all cores.,i think i should be good for the next 2 years at least.,"i game at 1440p, my next path to upgrade is the 3090ti.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very nice.,the gains were bigger than i thought for how gpu demanding those are.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you using dlss in all of these?,can you do a test with dlss off?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

also double edit : it definitely pays to have a more modern cpu with a 4090 no matter the resolution.","at least a 12th gen intel or 7000 series zen, or 5800x 3d.","though the 5800x3d doesn't tend to do super well compared to its normal performance in heavy rt titles, intel pulls away a ton there.",it does better in simpler cache heavy games tho like mmos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the problem is most of these games suck,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah is it intentionally lowered for these or something?,mine boosts to like 5.1 on its own.,the only thing i've changed from stock is the voltage.,i feel like the extra 600mhz would help quite a bit wouldn't it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™ve been debating if i should grab a 3090ti or wait for the 4080

10900k and 1440p here as well",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
his 10900k is running at 4.5 instead of 4.9 all core.,the u14s may have problems at full 250 watts load but should handle games.,cyber punk is kinda an outlier as it hits the cpu quite hard for game,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they use a deep cool ak620 which appears to not be enough if it can hit 90c at 50% usage.,the results are also skewed as the 10900k is at 4.5ghz and not 4.9 all core,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"since you have a 4090, both the 7950x and 13900k blow the 5800x3d out of the water

the reason why the 5800x3d looked good is because the 13900k and 7950x were so gpu bound that they are comparable without the 4090",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"competition is good for consumers, i like to know as well",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you have ddr5 you will probably see more gains.,but ops 10900k is also oddly low at 4.5ghz when stock all core is 4.9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at stock 4.9ghz is all core and 5.1ghz would be single core.,but yea i am wondering if the missing 400mhz-500mhz would change some things depending how many cores have load.,this seems unfair tbh but maybe it helps them justify their purchase,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i currently have a 3070. for my 1440p 165hz.,and it has been great.,i usually avg 120fps solid for aaa titles.,with a mixture of high to ultra settings.,"but, i know with the 3090ti, or at least with my calculations, i should be able to reach that 165hz, and most likely stay at that refresh rate with the 3090ti.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ok, it's just im planning to replace my i9 9900k with the 13700k in the future.",now im concerned that my corsair h150i elite capellix is not enough to cool the 13700k.,do you have any experience with the ak620?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, i donâ€™t know how to take these results.","it might have been a mistake, but he was notified hours ago, and has not made mention of it.",either a flawed comparison or a disingenuous one.,"i am guessing flawed, as literally 10%+ of the 10th gen is being cut out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh donâ€™t get me wrong, for most games i avg that or greater with my 3080 but iâ€™m trying to future proof myself with cyberpunk as my benchmark.",obviously that game could be far better optimized but i think if youâ€™ve got a setup that can run that smoothly with quality or even no dlss then youâ€™re pretty much set for the future.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just upgraded from 9900k to 13700k and am using the h150i elite capellix.,if youâ€™re like me and have any questions about performance or cooling in games feel free to ask!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's below a nh d15 in all the reviews i've seen so you should be fine with a h150i.,most games also won't be near cyber punk levels of usage.,at max usage if you intended to like render at 250w it will still be quite hot though but nothing like the 320+- the 13900k pulls.,i believe op is also in a smaller form factor case which also drastically can affect air coolers if air flow is not great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seems they talked about it on another subreddit.,and they mentioned their cpu at stock only holding 4ghz under heavy load.,so they said they set 4.5ghz.,it would be nice to see it re tested at the stock 4.9ghz and unlock the power limits as i wonder how much of the gain would disappear,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i take it you've seen the club 386 article on 125w and 65w power limits for the 13900k?,power limits seem to be the way to go over undervolting.,gaming performance loss is minimal and multicore performance isn't too badly hit.,going to try a 125 watt limit today and see what temps are like.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

good news.,"i was able to get it stable using [intel extreme tuning utility](https://i.imgur.com/cyw2vpf.png)

in turbo boost you set it to 80w, which is the recommended for eco mode, and works pretty well.","in the games i've tried i'm getting 50c, which is really great.",[this guy](https://youtu.be/6niig7qycke?t=242) also talks about the app if you are interested.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
agreed.,the chip is insane.,"5.2/4.2 @ 1.1v, almost 37k, 195 watt at peak power.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"thank you, what a wonderful starting point.",with default settings (except xmp for my ddr4-3600).,"mce on, i did -0.1 vcore offset and i'm running now a constant boost of 5.4-5.5ghz (5.0-5.1ghz before), pushing my cinebench (10min) from 38122 to 39750. all that with a noctua nh-d15.","pushing it to -0.105 was already too much, but -0.1 seems to run stable so far.","after turning off mce, all cores boost to 5.3ghz, still got 39570, temps are mostly between 85-90â°c now and no thermal thottling anymore.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for writing this up.,very useful information.,i'll be giving your numbers a go as my baseline to see what i can manage performance-wise.,the only thing i might try differently is limiting max power draw to 253w and checking gaming power stability and usage with that kind of undervolt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's quite good.,what kind of core voltage offset are you running to achieve this?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wow you have a golden sample.,do u have an asus board?,mind sharing your sp rating,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
okay im at - 0.08v and set pl1 & pl2 at 125w.,why do you go with 260w?,you doesn't have to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, but the post i was responding to was talking about 125w and 65w limits, which would arguably be reached by most users under normal workloads.","obviously if you set a limit above whatever your cpu regularly draws, then the limit will not be reached and cannot impact performance â€” but at the same time, having that limit is literally meaningless until the power draw reaches it, at which point it will impact performance.","but, cpus are clearly getting to the point where they are capable of drawing more power than can be effectively cooled, so power limits are going to be a fact of life.","but i would argue that undervolting should be step #1, and then after that, limiting your power draw to whatever your thermal solution can handle.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you also run occt / prime95 avx tests?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think i will also do a power limit near 250w, depending on how much impacts on performance.","also, remember that this power numbers are only reached on huge demand on applications like cinebench, designed to use every little resource on the cpu.",on games you will not have that much.,"i do game programming and even when compiling a lot of things or shaders, that workload doesn't reach the constant load of cinebench.","&#x200b;

as a final notice, using intel extreme tunning, by default, 2 cores are in x58 (5800mhz).",i recommend you to put those on x55 (like the rest of them) so the voltage offset doesn't fail when trying to reach x58 with less voltage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i run a fixed voltage for both.,5.8p/4.5e/5.1cache.. voltage is 1.260v in the bios.,"if i run the cpu stock, i can get by with just 1.190v auto llc@230 watts max r23 30 minute.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i am confused here as i am running 6.2ghz from my 13900k, though the voltage is a bit high and even in a really excellent custom loop i'm hitting limits of the ihs i believe.","probably need to think about direct die and liquid metal next.. i am quite certain i got a golden sample though, a lot of people don't understand sp or dont talk about it or dont believe it.","mine changed when  i updated the bios for 13th gen microcode on strix z690a d4, running 32gb of g-skill b-die ddr4-4400 at cl 14 1.46v mem..

i am curios to see what other sp ratings people are getting (honestly) as ive seen some that were too good to be true and no screenshots to show it.. im wondering where i stand!",thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes i do!,"i have a 24cores, 32threads processor and i want to get as much performance as my aio can dissipate.","i work programming games, and i need to build, package, and compile often, so those cores really do a hard work all together.","if i go to 125w, performance will be reduced for sure.","and at 260w i do not suffer throttling, so it's my sweet spot",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
valid points here.,"will agree to disagree on undervolting in specific applications eg for work from home business use, the questionable stability over time from an undervolt would push me more towards power limiting over undervolting in those scenarios.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh okay, im only gaming with my 13900k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i usually test with a super unrealistic workload, like prime 95 small ffts with avx.",any issues and i reduce the undervolt.,"this doesnâ€™t allow for those massive -0.1v undervolts that might pass cinebench or normal daily use, but like you, i donâ€™t want any instability.","but every hundredth of a volt drop does have a measurable impact on power draw and heat output, so i find it worthwhile.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no wonder amd has been doing so poorly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the only good reason to go with amd is if you want to future proof for zen 5 since you won't have to replace the mobo, and if you need a pc like right now.",still not a good enough motive to go amd with those prices (cpu is expensive and requires ddr5),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i mean, it's a full on slaughter at the moment.","&#x200b;

the 13900k beats the 7950x in every single game with maybe a very few exceptions.",you can even limit the 13900k to about 80w and the situation is still pretty much the same.,"productivity loads are trading blows left & right but if you're a big adobe software user, the 13900k takes the cake because of the better single core performance.","&#x200b;

power draw wise, they are about 40w apart at max load.","and if you're looking at such a cpu, it makes no sense to use a bad cooler (for workloads, for gaming you can use a trash cooler and limit the power draw safely).","&#x200b;

the 13900k can be used on z690 with ddr4 which means potentially even more gaming performance.","&#x200b;

as i predicted, the 7000 series is a complete dodge unless you really need avx512.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

- i can run a demanding game on one monitor and use xfinity app to watch live tv on the other twin monitor and have no hiccups like i used to get on the 8700k, even with like 50 chrome tabs open (this would fuck the 8700k even though i had 64 gb of ddr4).","remember it's not just clock speed, the cache size and ipc of the 12th and 13th gen absolutely shit on the 7th and 8th gen. maybe it still doesn't matter at 4k, but it definitely makes a difference at 1440p with decent refresh rate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
damn.,i got my 10850k for $270 and can't do 5ghz all core without it turning into a furnace.,voltage is already 1.4 at 4.9ghz all core,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great deal!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

10900k 5.3 ghz 24/7.,can hit 5.5 w 1.4v.,i have 3 massive radiators but the temp spikes will hit it to 90c before it cools back down to 80.   at 5.3 i only need 1.28 (w some llc) and i top 60c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did upgrade 9900k  to 13900k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
see what your 9900k is selling for on ebay!!,"i listed my old one when i upgraded and just tossed it in an auction

my jaw dropped when i saw it sold for $400 lmao, it's really insane how well halo tier products can maintain value, especially if they're the end of an upgrade path on a platform",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9900k here too.,decided to go with the 13700k and got bb to price match microcenter on first try.,$430 shipped after tax.,will sell my 9900k + mobo and have a pretty free upgrade besides the install time.,"im pushing a c1 for single player, a 1440p 240hz for multi and another for media/general.",no real problems now with the 9900k and a 3090 but excited to see what new stability 13th gen offers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my microcenter website stock is wrong.,said sold out at my local but they had atleast a dozen in the case.,power bill about to hurt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
still such a great processor for gaming and overclocking!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yup gaming only.,my og 9900k purchased the week of release is unreal.,i can run 5.2 all core under 1.4 volts.,"i just broke into the top 100 in time spy for my combination hardware, running a 3080 ti.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no point to upgrade unless it's dp 46.0 and pcie 98,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably because they wanted the longevity of the platform to be a selling point.,there's no way they were going to support ddr4 for 3 generations.,"if you ask me, they should've released a zen 4 part on am4 too.",or lower the priced of the 5800x3d.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you were amd would you want to still be designing ddr4 imcs in 2025 or later?,would you want to face horrendous backlash for breaking compatibility with zen 5 on ddr4 motherboards?,"bandaid rip was the easiest, least painful thing amd could do.",intel only had 2 gens to support ddr4 and ddr5 simultaneously.,amd would have 3 or 4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because the 7000 series cpus would seem a lot less impressive if paired with ddr4 memory.,"this is true for alder lake and raptor lake as well, i donâ€™t see ddr4 support to be a selling point unless you already own ddr4 memory sitting around, as itâ€™s not worth the performance loss when doing a new build",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i believe they are on the record for 3 cpu cycles total for am5 at a minimum.,they've been good about this on consumer platforms.,(lets not talk about threadripper) however im not sure if they plan on counting 3d cache variants.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i feel like longevity is one of the biggest selling points of am5, people don't want to have to change their motherboard out everytime they want a new cpu.","amd has confirmed that they will support it until at least 2025, so we can expect at least 3 generations, if not more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what the fuck is the channel name argument?,"linus isn't giving actual tech tips, hardware unboxed isn't about unboxing, lowspecgamer is no longer about low spec gaming, and what the fuck is a gamers nexus anyways?",channel names make no sense.,moore's law is dead is honestly a really cool name for a tech channel.,"also, mlid isn't an amd shill at all, its just that amd fucked up so bad this gen that everybody who had any hopes for them look like shills now.","he's also gotten a lot of things right like the 4080 12gb unlaunch, nvidia's aib problems, and even evga's departure to an extent.",his main mistakes were the arc cancellation and the 13th gen pricing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"rcp is not actually the retailer msrp, youâ€™re a clown if you think that.",intel wouldnâ€™t publicly release retailer unit pricing because they likely sell their cpus at different prices to different retailers to increase their margins.,this would not be possible if they released retailer pricing publicly.,"thus, retailer pricing is completely private information.",the rcp is really nothing more than a fancy word for msrp,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i just upgraded my computer from a first gen i7-920 to a 12700k.,itâ€™s wild how much faster everything is lol.,though kudos to those old i7 processors.,"combined with an ssd, and itâ€™s still enough processing power for the average pc user",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"honestly don't know how long that price will be for at mc, listed as \*sale current\*.",but if you don't plan on waiting for the ks and you have microcenter nearby i would get the cpu as soon as you can.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean isnt it impresive that intel can match the performance at a 50w diference with a 10nm node vs a 5nm node?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
amd is on record saying this is how it's going to be from here on out.,:/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is complete nonsense.,the efficiency of raptor lake and zen 4 is absolutely insanely good.,the performance they have when limited to like 100w is enough to blow previous gen cpus out of the water.,the problem isnâ€™t efficiency - itâ€™s that they are packing much higher core counts and clockspeeds out of the box.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, itâ€™s horrendous.","the *13600k* apparently throttles under a 360mm aio in all-core loads without power limits, and canâ€™t hit its max boost with them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its still cheaper to just buy a cpu than to buy it with a mobo a new ddr5 kit (if you were using ddr4 with 13th gen),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can always set the power limit.,"but if i were to build a sff, i would go with the i5 anyway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wattage as well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah but the voltage can be lowered to match your desired temp and the 13900k is still going to give you the best performance per watt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
acccording to intel the msrp is $589-$599.,retailers are just inflating the costs because of demand.,https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/230496/intel-core-i913900k-processor-36m-cache-up-to-5-80-ghz/specifications.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"v-cache ends up just being a dodge for amd though, as meteor lake launches next year on a new node, new architecture, likely more e-cores, etc.","v-cache can probably edge out the 13900k/13700k by 5% in gaming only, but be more expensive and then beaten again by 14th gen in both gaming and mt.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"dam, thatâ€™s just how tech works xd.",i got mine like a year and half ago.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it matters even at 4k.,"the difference between 12900k and 5800x at 4k with 4090 is same as the difference between 12600k vs 12900k in games (\~7% avg, some >10%).",and that is compared to zen3 never mind older cpus will bottleneck ada and rdna3 even harder,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dang that's rough my 10900kf does 5ghz and 4.7 uncore at 1.27v load voltage and it's sp score is horrible at 64 but it's bounced around as bios updates seem to change it.,but it hits a hard wall and i could never imagine running 5.3ghz under reasonable voltage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mine too.,except i got mine new from microcenter for $399 back in december 2020. sad.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this might just be me, but i mainly enjoy overclocking for trying to set records on 3dmark haha, not actually because i care about the 2-3 extra fps i can eek out cranking voltages and tuning clocks

i already bought the 11900k and z590-e. i was happy with the purchase.,"really nice motherboard with heaps of features, and cod mwii to go with it.","basically, i was looking for a slightly cheaper/mid-range price on higher end parts and don't mind going slightly older.","the 5600, although i would go 5700x for 8-core minimum would be great if i can find a well priced mini-itx motherboard for a tiny nas/home server build.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the reason to undervolt is for better temps with basically the same performance!!,"optimum tech on youtube has some great videos on undervolting

you can reduce temps like 20â°c and power draw like 80 watts in some cases, all while maintaining the same performance

with one 3080 i tested i was able to get higher scores on port royal with an undervolt since the card was able to hit higher stable boost clocks at lower temperatures since it didn't have as much power (aka heat) running through it

chip manufacturers are really good at boosting to the max your thermals will allow for, and short of a custom loop or liquid nitrogen, a good undervolt can be your best bet!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'm also considering the amd platform.","the decision for me will likely come down to a battle of eco modes, and undervolt-ability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

your cpu doesnt need to be maxed out to be bottlenecking weirdly.,"upgrading, my 10900k would sit at like 30-50% usage.",and now the 13700k also sits at like 40% at most but its still signficantly faster.,"i dont know how they count usage on alder and raptor lake though tbh, i dont know if its all cores or only the p ones",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the 10900 is an amazing cpu still, so that's perfectly fine.","honestly with anything less than a 4090, at 4k there will be zero difference in cpus since this gpu is like 60-70% than the next closest (3090ti).",and that's bigger than any of the gaps i saw here.,at lower resolutions though i can't really say,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with a 3090?,"anywhere from 0-30% improvement, depending on the game.","you're going to be gpu bottlenecked in most cases tho, so probably like 5-10% on average.",you would've gotten the same gaming performance with a 13600k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they're basically the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it isn't.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you have to look at individual core load, not whole cpu load.","games are usually garbage at using modern multi-core cpus, usually just pegging few threads.","so ipc and what single core/thread can do still plays big role for games, while it is getting less and less important for productivity stuff.",that's how intel now managed to get even with amd by adding those garbage e-cores.,"they are useless for games, but help a lot in productivity tests and those p-cores with added cache now have even a bit better ipc than zen4 (although using much more power).",enjoy you new rig.,"both gen 13 intel and zen 4 amd are great stuff and we all profit from having back the ""arms race"" for performance crown in cpu market.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if your overall useage is that low, then that means you have way more cores than you need.","so some of your cores are getting maxed out, while the others are sitting idle.",the 13600k would've been the perfect upgrade for you.,you'd get all the performance while saving $100.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah, are we talking i cinebench r23?",because in multicore i get almost instant 100â°c (stock) with a dark rock pro 4. and also thermal throttling.,my score is a bit lower than what i've read so far (around 29000).,"already tried repasting, same results.","i've read that this is ""normal"", just not sure how well i'm off here.",coming from amd 3700x these temps are a bit scary.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"keep in mind it's a single run, im sure 10 minute run i'd reach 90+c, i dialed down the voltage which helps reduce temps as well",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank god.,i haven't received my 13700 yet but i'm building a new pc and managed to get a d15 for nearly half-off.,i've been using a 212-evo on an 8700k forever so it's a relief that the 13700 can be reasonably air-cooled.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with the rock pro 4?,"then i must have botched the thermal paste, cause under load (in modern warfare 2 (also a bit oc)), i spike into the 90's.","but i am usually around 75-80  


after and hour idle, core temperatures is averate 40c",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just a small oc to 5.4ghz on p cores and 4.4ghz on e cores.,the idle temp you have is just a bit too high even with an overclock should be no more than 40 degrees at worst.,"double check you cooler, is it an aio liquid cooler?","also, in bios i would not use ai overclocking as that tends to push way to much on the vcore voltage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
interesting.,it seems the 13th gen intel runs hotter.,"no background apps, and avg temp 60-65 c in mw2.",my vertical gpu mount for 4080 and o11d mini case could be contributing too to the heat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have the h170i and it keeps it at 90c during a cinebench 30 min run, only prime95 can make it hit 100c after 5 min   


55x p-cores, 42x e-cores",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i might look into that.,but now i just power limited it to 125w.,lost like 3000 points in cinebench and it sips half the power.,worth it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea itâ€™s unfortunate cpus are taking on more power.,"but competition is hot now & i donâ€™t see cpu companies using less power, only power efficient with newer models",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yea r23, and r20",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just so you know, i also have the 13700k at stock speed with the dark rock pro 4, and i'm also getting instant 100â°c, and i'm also getting just above 29000 in r23.","i came here searching for confirmation that this is normal, and the more i look, the more that looks correct.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i recently upgraded to an i7 13700k and i am in the same boat as you.,i am using a corsair 280mm aio in the nzxt h510 flow and the second i load up cinebench r23 (multicore) the chip skyrockets to 100c.,the intel xtu software says its immediately thermal throttling.,i have tried repasting and reseating the cooler to be sure but i still get the same results.,have you done any more experimenting?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that makes a lot more sense now ;)

i now undervolted as well, -130mv and now i achieve temps in the 90s w/o throttling (10min run).",single run maxes out at 84â°,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just make sure you screw the heatsink all the way in.,at first i was too gentle and had high temps.,then i screwd it all the way in and temps were fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
noctua nd h15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just put in a dark rock pro on mine and i didn't care for it at all - my last cooler was a noctua and theirs has much better (and easier) mounting system.,"i'm at 41 basically at idle (this web browser, steam, and music bee)

one thing i noticed with the dark rock was that even once i screwed it all the way in, the fan was still sliding around a bit, it's mechanism is absolutely garbage.","i dread taking this thing apart again, but i think i might order a black noctua and return the dark rock before the return period is up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i ended up downvolting by -0,13v and now it stays in the 90s w/o thermal throttling, i can live with that (better score and less power consumption).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yep, i undervolted by -0,13v and now it stays in the 90s w/o throttling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think with spring you always screw until contact( end ) without applying torque on it since spring wont unscrew by it self.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
one time i screwed my cpu cooler too tight & it affected the ram,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
does your cinebench score improve or decrease?,i have heard different things about undervolting and the effects it has on performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you undervolt through the bios or xtu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can you explain how it affected your ram?,i think i have some kind of ram issue... from time to time i can't boot my pc and need to touch gently ram (like trying to push it in) and then my pc boots alright.,can it be because i screwd heatsink to tight?,i don't think heatsink touches the ram tho...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it increased since there was no more thermal throttling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bios since i have dual os on my machine and wanted it for both,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for me my system was able to boot, but the ram wasnâ€™t able to do dual channel mode.",searched the internet for answers & concluded it was because cpu cooler was strewed too tight,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok iâ€™ll have a look!,thanks for that!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sorry, i donâ€™t know why it uses so much memory.",my question for you is mcafee?,why?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"also, how is 96% of your memory in use?","how much do you have, and what else was running at the time that you took that screenshot?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
memory leak?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very likely a memory leak.,close/kill it and restart.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at least yours will launch.,mine launches maybe 15% of the time after reinstall.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"because you are never satisfied with windows 3.1 looking apps, they have to make it bloated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
more important question.,why are you using that anti virus service?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at this point i might have to uninstall intel arc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"lol, seems like intel arc drivers will be broken forever at this point.",2 months after a380 released and zero game performance improvement happened with driver updates,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
going to guess it's a prebuilt therefore it was pre-installed bloatware.,nobody in their right mind would install that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have mcafee since i bought this pc im lazy to uninstall it plus i dont know how to permanently do it since i heard it always comes back,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looks like 4 gigs... get 32,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nothing was running i have 8 gigs like i restarted my pc and the first thing i saw was arc control destroying my memory,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
youre totally right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the one time they don't have the superior product, they raise prices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
everyone used to say 'amd is better cos they cost less'.,"yet time and time again any time amd think they have the upper hand, they overprice their cpus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my guess is amd gets most of its revenue from servers with epyc and cpus used in ps5 and xbox game consoles and don't think they need to release budget cpus on a regular basis like intel does with the i3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
way of business is strange one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how the table has turned.,"four years ago it was intel competing with expensive, low-core cpus, now it's amd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
will they try pricing rx7900xt above rtx 4090 tho if it somehow manages to beat it by like 10% in raster?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they didn't raise prices, prices went down or stayed the same (depending on which cpu) compared to last gen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"amd used to cost less in exchange for products with poor longevity, especially the early 1000-2000 series that had horrendous single core performance.","if anything, their more recent products like the 5000 and 7000 series are much better value investments, despite their premium msrp, because they will last you years before needing an upgrade",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am sure datacenter is profitable.,great healthy margins there.,i think being on tsmc n5 is where most cost is at.,this is a leading edge node.,apple isn't even moving away from this node yet.,i think demand being down but leading edge manufacturing is starting to get really expensive.,or well it always has been expensive.,"demand down, sales down, and tsmc doesn't want to lose good engineers.",costs have to go up somewhere.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i mean intel made i3s even when they were dominating everyone, even when they didnt need to make i3s",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so basically all amd cpus are crap, both when overpriced sand underpriced.",thats exactly what i've been saying for years.,all the so called 'cheap' amd cpus in the past were still beaten by a â£50 intel celeron.,'intel is expensive!',"amd fans always said, feel free to say that to my â£40 pentium g4560 backup build which still outperformed amd top end for several generations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>i think being on tsmc n5 is where most cost is at.,this is a leading edge node.,n5 is 2 years old now and n3 is now the leading edge node.,cost of manufacturing and what amd pays to tsmc is always only a tiny fraction of the cost of product,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i understand this is the intel subreddit but calling all amd cpus crap is dumb and you sound like a raging intel homer.,"iâ€™m sure youâ€™re 2c/4t pentium outperformed all of those and cpus, lol.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thatâ€™s not what iâ€™m saying at all, like i said i think the 5000 and 7000 series cpus from amd are very good for their time.",only that intelâ€™s offerings have been even better in terms of value with alder lake and now raptor lake,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they are though, either for the performance, or for the price.",thats a fact that can be backed up by 100% of reviews.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh right yes, that's mainly when intel kept doing 14+++++++++++++",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

so tldr; 1. turn off killer software forever and it services and change prefered band to 5ghz (or 2.4 ghz if u still got dc's) then u can try to change other options as i did.,"hope it helps

&#x200b;

i feel you, same card btw, i always had problems with disconnecting or very low down/up speed.","what i done to fix everything below, downloaded newest drivers from intel site first tho.","seems like the best fix for

1. hard disconnecting in my case (like i got fully disconnected from my wifi usually when watching vids on yt or gaming):

\- in device manager change ""preffered band"" to either 5ghz or 2.4 ghz (weaker one), in my previouse home for some reason i had dc's while gaming if not at 2.4ghz.",but try 5ghz first and keep it if possible becouse its best for network speed - also this doesnt happen for me for like year so might got fixed in some driver release.,"2. half disconnecting (like im connected but internet stop working, happens usually while downloading stuff) + very low down/up speeds:

\-first of all, make sure killer control center isnt running and is turned off from startup in task manager

\-then go to services.msc and turn off 4 services with word killer then 2 more with starting with x, they are xtendsomething.","this way u will turn off all killer services, i tested a lot of this killer software to download and gaming at once etc, but in my case it never worked well and there was visible handicap with down/up speeds becouse of it.","after this step this should dissapear, but if not then i also do:

in device manager again:

mimo feature - off (its about turning off antena's, does it change shit?","no idea and  im using ""preffered band: 5ghz"" only)

from 802,11n/ac/ax i choose the one with 'ac' cuz my router only support this instead of default ax

from 802,11a/b/g i choose ""5ghz 802.11a"" cuz dualband suck imo and this make me more sure that i use only 5ghz band

packet booster or something like that i turn on, didnt hurt from my testing, and maybe its actually do something

mobile aggresive or something like that from 3. to 1.","(the one saying lowest) its actually about changing antenas from 5 to 2.4 depends on the signal afaik, so it doesnt matter for me but just becouse i can i choose that aswell

i also flushed dns at the end and then restarted.",after all of that my wifi speeds went from either 100 mbps download and for some reason 5 mbps upload to proper \~350 mbps (cant get more becouse of shitty isp router ;/) download and proper 40 mbps upload.,like unbelievable relief.,so tldr; 1. turn off killer software forever and it services and change prefered band to 5ghz (or 2.4 ghz if u still got dc's) then u can try to change other options as i did.,hope it helps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intel has said that all versions of the core series will have p and e cores on the 13th generation.,also your board would need a bios update to support 13th gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ill just say 13th gen definitely utilizes ddr5 better than ddr4.,if you want to unlock the full potential of 13th gen id definitely recommend ddr5.,if your budget restricted stick to ddr4 now but upgrade later.,if your buying a new mobo for 13th gen then just get ddr5 now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i don't really see the point in having z790 boards with ddr4 unless intel plans to discontinue z690 soon and keep the ram option open for people who upgrade.,"ddr4 makes more since with the mid-range b760, but not so much for the high-end z790 since ddr5 prices have gone down and these boards can take better advantage of higher speed ddr5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah on paper but real world tasks dont really end up doing that like your implying, so say it did drop to 30 and the lows were what you say they ar this would not really happen much like almost not at all  average frames it will lose period and in workstations as well obviously with how much more data transfer ddr5 has.",every one cant wait to get new amd or intel cpus same with the gpus but the component that is also the next generation and an important one if your cores getting info quickly which leads to better performance everywhere no mater gaming or workstation applications all of a sudden its opposite day current cpus are slower than all of the ones that have been around 5-7 yeas about as old as ddr4 same with the gpus does that make sense well bout as much as most things now days or what i call ass backwards,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i had my eyes on amd since 2017 the year they made a huge comeback and really began to give intel the tough competition and time with their ryzen cpus.,i even had browsed a couple of ryzen 3 and then 5 series cpus as a potential candidate for my next cpu upgrade but somehow i didn't feel the need to upgrade but now i do.,amd was actually on my mind since i actually finalized the thought to get an overhaul and i was opting for amd ryzen a couple of months ago.,"but then after reading and researching about market trends regarding famous youtubers and general pc gamers forums, i found out that intel made a comeback with their 12th gen. and then i also found out that amd was having severe overheating issues with their 5000 series cpus and in some cases they were actually getting burnt like totally dead like toast.","after reading a lot, i inclined towards intel 12th gen and now 13th gen i5 13600k since it threw the 12900k out of the window in many many benchmarks both in games and productivity.",i constantly am finding that amd is still facing overheating issues besides the fact that amd cpu motherboards are hell expensive than the intel platform upgrade.,you could be right regarding the upcoming amd line of new cpus but the more i'd wait the more confused i'll get since tech innovation won't stop.,"right after amds new line of cpus, intel will definitely announce some new performance breakthroughs in their upcoming 14th gen and that would make me delay even more....

so for the time being, i am sure, for myself, intel i5 13600k seems to be the best option at a very very reasonable price.","the performance is mind boggling, slightly lower than the ryzen 79xx something cpu and al half the cost.","but i still appreciate a lot, that you made your input and no doubt amd is now a great competitor against intel.",ðÿ‘ðÿ‘,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for your wisdom and suggestions.,btw i am getting a lot confused between opting for either i5 13600k or i7 12700k?,and what do you think how much price drop you are expecting regarding the 12th gen intel cpus this coming black friday?,like currently i7 12700k dropped to us$ 340 range.,i wish that it falls down near to us$ 250 this coming black friday.,is it my overly bloated wishful thinking or you expecting that the prices of 12th gen will really go south below $300 mark????,?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

always has been.,... kind of.,for example amd cpus now automatically go to 95c almost regardless of which coolers you slap on.,they'll try to pull more and more juice to clock higher to get the highest frequency until they hit 95c.,"they all say it's ""safe"", and the public has always been uneasy with it.",but we're not engineers.,a lot of people with no electronic engineering background think they know better than intel and amd on safe temps.,their already are safe temps limits programmed in place for both.,on the other side of the argument is that of course higher temps will reduce life of the cpu.,that's been confirmed by amd and intel for years.,the question is how much shorter the cpu will live.,does it matter if your cpu now lives for 9 years instead of 10?,it'll be worth $10 by then anyways.,"it might increase their warranty claims by a small amount, but it's so small they probably don't care.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"check out the rest of the comments, it's because power limits were unrestricted by default by the asus motherboard.","if i enforce the intel limits it stays at a reasonable temperature (peak of 90s, mostly 80s.)","i also found that enabling the ""ai overclocking"" feature properly characterizes the aio and stays mostly within thermal limits, not hitting 100 anymore but having better performance (40700 cinemark score or so.)","asus shows an overclock of ""106%"" on boot, sp 109, cooler 173",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sure thing.,"i also played with the ""ai overclocking"" feature, it actually results in some appreciable performance improvement, at least on benchmarks.","go to your bios and click the ""ai oc guide"", it tells you exactly what to do.","when in that mode i think you should also set the multicore enhancement back to ""auto"".","anyway feel free to play with it, from what i read there really isn't a way you can damage the chip - even at 100 degrees it will just throttle performance, and maybe reduce longevity, but it won't die.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is yours the latest revision with thinner backplate?,"i used the argb rev 3 and i have to say i'm having trouble cooling it down at stock with asus z790 strix, i'm hitting 100c on 4-5 p-cores on 10 minute run cb23

big if true, i guess i'll have to shell out a bit for another cooler but the hassle with lian li 011, i have to remove the motherboard first to install another/remove backplate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes they definitely should force mobo makers to not apply higher power limits than intel specifies on default.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i agree.,i love having the mo-ra and a compact computer instead of a large tower like the 1000d :-) it ultimately depends on what you like indeed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then you do have a seating issue.,water with my aio on 9900k oc was going above 40c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah.,7980xe skylake-x meme cpu owner.,delided.,"if i go 4.8+ ghz allcore, then the cpu can get pretty toasty, 1x 420mm and 2x 360mm rads.","when i had only the 420mm with one 120mm then you could feel the heat coming out of them so the rad space was not enough but since i swapped the 120mm one with 2x 360mm rads then the temps got slightly better and i was getting cool air from them yet the cpu was still almost thermal throttling, cpu block heat transfer limit.","tried different thermal compounds, offsets, pressure yet the cpu block surface can trasfer only as much heat.",must be said that this is only for a 300+w situations to where i can see only the 13900k getting with unlimited power limit or maybe even 7950x.,"pretty easy to spot, if you are getting hot air out of rads then you need more surface, if you are getting cool air and you still have really high temps then you hit the cpu block thermal transfer limit.",7980xe oced could pull a 400-500 wats no prob.,i am ditching it now for 13900k/7950x still deciding.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the dissipation of the cpu is actually 250w, so i don't think it's a mounting issue.",i just did configure the fans to speed up after 30c water (with an aquacomputer quadro controller) and it immediately makes a huge difference if the fans start to spin up  (i have 6 fans in push/pull on the radiator).,think the mounting is ok. the paste and pressure seems very evenly.,i even mounted it with proper torque-wrenches etc (and a bit more or less mounting pressure doesn't even matter).,"&#x200b;

i think, it's the block combined with too little flow of the pump.",that's why i was asking if and why you thought a custom loop could be better compared to the aio.,is a custom block and separate pump/resevoir really that much better than a aio pump-block?,and by how much?,i'd like to know before making the investment :p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, amd and intel denying there is any impact at all is definitely not true.",it's physically impossible.,"but 90% of laptops have been hitting 95c for years, with no significant impact.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you think a board thatâ€™s still considered consumer class need to be self tuned by the end user to not break spec?,by default should be normal restrictions.,any ocâ€™ing and power target adjustments should be a feature only enabled and adjusted by the user.,i donâ€™t know why this isnâ€™t considered the same realm as overclocking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was under the impression disabling mce also disabled turbo boost?,if you disable mce  can the cpu all core boost to 5.5ghz(13900k as an example),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

itâ€™s voltage that can really kill chips.,"not the levels of temperatures theyâ€™re allowed to run at by default (disable those and yeah, you could cause damage).","like, i know my 6950x can be killed quite quickly by the voltage levels that many x99 motherboards, by default, wanted to pump into them when you overclocked.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i did the same and found this thread :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what about gaming ?,i'm thinking of getting the 13600kf instead of 12400f with cm hyper 212 rgb be and i want to know about the temps of the cooler for the cpu at gaming,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i've got the same setup - i5 13600k with a deepcool ak620 and after 1 minute on full load (blender), it hits 100.

it's actually a relief to see someone else with the same issue!",i've reapplied the paste and no difference.,i'm planning on returning it and will probably get a liquid cooler instead.,it's a shame as all the reviews i've seen have the ak620 doing really well.,are we missing something?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was wondering the same thing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
me too!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the hyper 212 is not enough cooling for this chip.,"my noctua u-12s redux wasn't adequate, i had to go spring for an ak620.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with an ak620 i top out at ~72c while gaming.,"it does, however, hit 100 and throttle under full artificial load like cinebench.","which i'm not thrilled about, but i'm also not sure matters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i realize i'm replying to you twice, but i've come into some new information that lead to me fixing my situation entirely in the bios.","turns out msi motherboards (and i'd assume other manufacturers) by *default* will oversupply power and voltage to a cpu, in theory to let the chip push further and improve performance.","which i guess makes for good performance benchmarks, but is absolutely asinine if you care about thermals and power draw.","instead of leaving everything in the bios on auto, i manually enforced intel's stock tdp (188 watts - msi had given it 288), and adjusted a setting called ""cpu lite load"" (this, by default, oversupplies voltage to account for variations in chip lottery / ""bad chips"")

* i now top out at 88.5 in full load cinebench.","* it maintained boost speeds the entire 10 minute bench, at no point thermal throttling.","* it's pulling max 1.3v instead of 1.4v
* my cinebench score **went up** to 24263 from 23130

it's cooler, quieter, using less power, and literally performs better.",there's no downside.,i have no idea why the default bios settings oversupply it so much.,seems idiotic.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it appears to be a voltage issue i found a forum post where they lowered the default ""cpu lite load"" setting in bios from mode 12 to mode 5 and it made cpu run a lot cooler under load.","i wasn't comfortable shooting for mode 5 right away since going to low will cause instability, one 13600k might handle lower voltages than another 13600k it's a luck of the draw thing, so i slowly dropped the setting, tested for stability & temps w/ cinebench, dropped it lower & repeat.","currently have it at mode 8 and maxing out 89-90c after a 10 minute cinebench r23 run, no stability issues after going on day 3 now.",cpu lite load is found in the oc section of bios under advanced cpu config (assuming you have an msi motherboard).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"also found this video where they test cpu lite load on a 13600k with good results, at default mode 12 it was hitting 100c even being water cooled so think its safe to say voltage is the issue, at the end of the video he shows a chart and it says mode 9 is the intel guidelines for voltage so not sure why msi has it as 12 by default https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mkavitzoly",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thanks for sharing.,"i just purchased a 13600k / msi pro z690 combo on black friday, haven't bought a cooler yet.",i was wondering if the ak620 is still working fine for you now that you've had the lite load tweak going for a few weeks.,not sure if it's worth springing for an aio.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[gamersnexus](https://youtu.be/ugm6fcldckk) has the ak620 just a hair ahead actually.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the above results were with lite load 10.,"(it defaulted to 12 for me)

i haven't tried lowering it further, but in theory could.","i've seen advice to go as low as is still stable under stress test, and then move it one higher to play it safe.",but i'm also not worried about pushing lower with the current temps / performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep - this mirrors my experience exactly.,"nice to see the topic covered in depth, so that the information is ""out there"".",completely crazy that the mobo manufacturers have chosen to do this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i havent tried any lower than cpu lite load 7 but it has been 100% stable at 7, gaming temps in the mid/upper 60s and tops out around 79c while encoding in avidemux which is the most intensive thing i occasionally do on this pc so i'm happy with the ak620.","be sure to update your msi bios as mine wasn't new enough to support 13th gen and wouldn't post until i updated it, thankfully this motherboard supports usb flashback which works with or without a cpu installed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thats perfect, is there virtually any difference between lite load and undervolting?",what are ur room temperatures like?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"awesome, that sounds good to me.",thanks for the advice i'm gonna get this cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my (rough) understanding is that lowering lite load is just countering the relatively minor overvolting the board is doing by default.,"undervolting is, i think, a step further, lowering the voltage curve below intel stock specs.",how far you can push both of these depends on the individual quality of your chip.,"if you're lucky you can hit lite load 1.

i do not know if this can or should be combined with actual undervolting - you'll have to do some research there.","and room temp is fairly low at the moment, as it's a basement and it's like -10c outside right now.",rooms maybe 20ish.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its not getting big discounts anyways for a while so might as well just do it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very little chance we are going to see more than a $20 discount in a month.,"it literally just launched, is getting good reviews and it beats the $550 7900x and $500 12900k.",there is no reason for intel to drop prices for a sale.,so ask yourself if its worth waiting a month of not having a 13700k to save $30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i would wait, i guess z690 and rams should have discounts in black fridy so there is money to save.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am personally in the exact same situation (8700k) as you and did buy it.,the discount you will get is most likely rather small.,the main reason you should buy now is because your time has value and having to look for deals is going to cost you too much time.,the only reason you shouldnâ€˜t buy is because you want to wait for november 3rd for a possible announcement of 7800x3d.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wait.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wait.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m more so curious if there would be a motherboard that would be discounted as a package deal.,i donâ€™t expect the processor to be discounted by itself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s exactly what iâ€™m wondering.,"i need a board as well, so maybe itâ€™s worth the month wait just to see if thereâ€™s a good deal on a board bundle with it or board and ram bundle with it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you buy the 12700k already?,or it's just on the list?,"if you haven't bought the 12700k, get the 13600k instead.","if you bought it already, then probably not worth it.",make sure to read up on how to flash the bios though.,"if you are not confident, getting the 12700k would save you the hassle.",they are really close.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i will point out my observings from watching countless reviews.,"13600k ddr4 is equal, maybe on avg.",around 5% faster than 12700k ddr4 in games.,"13600k ddr5 is up to 19% faster than 12700k ddr5 in games, on avg 10% faster.",13600k and 12700k has simlar multithreaded performance.,"&#x200b;

12700k has 2 more performance cores, could (may not) potentially outlast 13600k for gaming, if you plant to keep it for more than 4 years.","12700k can oc better than 13600k, you could get additional 10-15% performance out of it.","but you need good cooling for it, not enthusiast, but good and it's going to then use more power.","&#x200b;

personally it would all depend on pricing, for same price would go with 12700k, ddr4 and oc it as i have cooling.","i would keep it for most probably for more than 5-6 years, i kept my 4770k for 9 years.","the ht (basically like 2 cores) like with 4770k vs 4670k, made difference between it being obsolete after 5-6 years and lasting me to 7-8 years with no struggles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did buy the i7 already.,it was on sale and me being new to this i just thought an i7 would automatically be better than an i5.,thank you for the advice.,iâ€™ll be sure to read up on how to flash the bios.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i will be upgrading from my trusty old 4770k build as well, would you happen to know if running both 13600k/12700k at stock (going itx route with very limited heating), which chip runs hotter?",i too watched so many reviews but no one seemed to have a conclusive answer.,"so i turn on reddit search and your comment popped up, thanks :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thank you for the comment, i appreciate it!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you buy the 12700k already then use it.,flashing the bios only applies to 13600k on z690 motherboard.,the 12700k should be plug and play.,"i repeat: if you keep the 12700k, no bios update is needed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"13600k runs much hotter actually, but it is a design intent to get as much performance out of it.",13600k also seems to get a much better boost from ddr5 and e cores vs 12700k over ddr4.,overall i sold the 12700k last week and have since upgraded my sister to 13700k.,thinking it over 13600k vs 12700k is a toss up.,"if you are going ddr5 go with 13gen, it benefits more from it over 12gen.","but if you are going ddr4, the 1270pk or 5800x3d looks better in terms of longevity.","then again if you are going ddr5, i would be considering amd platform, if cost is simlar to intel.","for their platform longevity, with v cache zen 4 on the horizon.",i also sold my 13600k platform and got 5800x3d as it suited my needs more with mmo and simracing.,while in other titles they are even on ddr4.,"plan is to upgrade to zen 4 v cache or zen 5 and ddr5, when prices will come down.","in scandinavia and germany it looks like anyway ddr5 6000 has come down to ddr4 4000 prices already, like for like and only mainstream ram like 3600 is 50% cheaper.",so i will probably be upgrading late 2023 or early 2024 to zen 4 v cache or zen 5. i am a minority to be honest upgrading that often.,only do it cause i do it as business expense anyway and i also got better prices than normal folks.,would not recommend it as strategy.,the best value is actually buying the cheapest adequate task scenario mid range options and riding it out until it's not enough.,as you pay for high end as much as for 2 mid range platforms and overtime mid range gets more cores and is faster already gen on gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got it.,the 12700 is plug in play.,no bio required.,thank you again for the help!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no problem!,i just donâ€™t want you to accidentally ruin your setup lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

13600k is the most easy to recommend cpu for everyone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how is the performance if you have done any gaming tests yet.,i have a 9600k oc'ed and was really thinking of going this route.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that cpu is the best out of this round of new cpus between intel and amd for overall value and great performance.,the 7600x just didnâ€™t bring it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's crazy how the base i5 is 14 cores.,my i7 5960x has 8 but the most i've seen it utilized in game is about 60%,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would 13600k be good for livestreaming games?,13900k seems so overkill,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you can sell your current 12600k and recover a good chunk of the investment in the 13600k as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™d watch some reviews for that type of detail!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

haha!,the 13 would have cost me only $50 cad more than the 12 and i only had the 12 since july.,at least when the time comes i can look for a 13900k its alright if its no silicon lottery i don't think i will need to overclock it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gen 14 might actually be a very small jump in st performance because rumors are that the new intel node isn't refined enough for high clocks.,same thing was happening with current intel 10nm too when it was used first time in tiger lake.,the efficiency and mt will certainly see a sizable jump because more efficient node and new arch for both p-cores and e-cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

using what cooler?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
see what the power draw is.,"you can undervolt or set a power limit etc......

as another poster said it depends on the cooler.",it also depends on the case cooling and the cpu usage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that sounds about right.,iâ€™m seeing high 70s on the 13900k with a 360 aio cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at stock settings those temps aren't surprising.,it's not your cooler it's the power consumption.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
specs?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"up to 69c at 5800mhz in tr benchmark (97% cpu usage)

at about 100w power draw while gaming in a plague tale.,"i sit around low 50's to 65 c. i have a custom  loop though, currently with no gpu in it until i get my block.","all rads are 30mm thick, one 420, and 2 360's.",my gigabyte z690 aorus auto boost to 5.5 all core and delivers about 1.3v to the chip while gaming.,i'm sure those temps will skyrocket when i get my gpu block.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm curious if an nzxt x63 280mm will be enough for 13900k with just c states and intel speed step turned off.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13900k custom loop.,while gaming i sit around 50 55c with my fans / pump not even going to 100%.,if i stress test i hit 80c and if i over clock and stress i can push it right to 95 97c but that was all pcores at 5800.  the idle temps bounce around from 31 to 38c but my pc is basically silent at that point and the pump is running around 20%.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea i am sitting sitting around 89 degrees while gaming.,i am using the h150i elite lcd cpu cooler.,i think they just run hot...i first tried the msi mag coreliquid c240 but the temo of my cpu was high (like it is now) so i switched to the h150i for more cooling and it seems to behave the same way...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm a little late to the party but anyway heres my experience: im using the h150i elite 360mm cooler form corsair.,games like mw2 or apex run at around 60-65c.,"hottest game i ran so far was battlefield 2042, hitting an average of about 75c, sometimes hitting the 80's.",cpu running on stock settings btw.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
msi mag 240mm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whats the difference between power limits and undervolting?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s msi mag 240mm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is that at idle?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"im getting 81- 85c and sometimes 89c, im using cooler masterliquid ml360r but its the only game... playing flight simulator, call of duty, overwatch 2 , apex etc around 71-75c",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how many rads are u using?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"undervolting is better, after that on top you may or not want to add power limiting.","with undervolting you can run same or higher clocks even at lower temps, with less voltage delivered to chip.","while power limiting is usually limiting power delivered to get lower temps, it can better your performance, but not always.","for example in auto a chip can run 5ghz at 1.2v, with maunaul setting the voltige you can potentially lower it.","so rhe chip runs 5ghz at 1.1v, that lower the temps and makes the clocks more stable, potentially increasing boost time frame or even it could run 5.1ghz at 1.1v.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2 44m 360s,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for undervolting i would at least keep an eye on a benchmark score like cinebench r23, because since 12th gen they've started clock-stretching.",my 12600k starts losing significant points below -70mv.,ymmv of course,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is xess already available in mwii?,very nice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this is only dp4 xess, not xmx xess, so slightly less taps than dlss2.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the quality on my eyes: native = dlss > xess > fsr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tbh i cannot tell the difference.,i have to pixel peep to see that maybe dlss > fsr > xess but honestly the difference is so tiny any of the options would be fine for most people,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there are 2 options for amd and 1 of them is a significant boost to fps and i don't notice much difference at all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"native looks better than dlss in this, look at his hat shadow during the water scene, and the flickering lights at the end.",however the native fps is poor.,"but i do agree with the  dlss > xess > fsr, except the difference between dlss and xess is pretty small compared to fsr which has far more issues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at least the fsr is really poor quality.,"like having a bad eyesight, everything is blurry.",check out the last scene in full screen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why is xess better than fsr?,i thought it's newer coming from intel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because they are only using fsr 1.0 and not fsr 2.1 like some other games have started to implement.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fsr 2.1 is great and uses a hand written algorithm which makes use of spacial and temporal data.,but it doesn't compare to the ai based techniques which use machine learning.,and that is the main reason why xess looks better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"unpopular opinion but i believe it's because amd makes awesome hardware but piss poor software (long time ati/amd fan since the 4080 through the 290x, even had quad-fire, and after i switched back to nvidia it was just better).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is fsr 2.1 similar to xess,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fsr 2.0/2.1 using temporal upscaling similar to xess.,fsr 1.0 uses spacial upscaling.,fsr 1.0 is much easier for programmers to implement due to amount of work required so they keep using it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, xess is similar to dlss as they both use machine learning hardware on the gpu to run and use a convolutional neural network.",fsr 2.1 is great and uses a hand written algorithm which makes use of spacial and temporal data.,but it doesn't compare to the ai based techniques.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just curious, does rdr 2 support fsr 2.1?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"necrothreading, but not out of the box.","you can mod it in though (this mod was originally created for cyberpunk 2077, but it can be used for any other game with dlss 2 support (although don't use it on games with anti-cheat like cod or fortnite though as you may get banned if you do so) & has a page on the rdr 2 nexus mods site):

"for me it was, i get to re-use my ddr4.",my cost for z690 + i5-13600k is less than $500.,"when i do a new build in a few years, ddr5 will be faster and cheaper and motherboards 2-3 years from now will probably have features that don't exist today.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i bought a 12700kf/z690/ddr5 about a month ago, because some of the parts were on sale.","honestly don't care about the 13th gen...more cores, but i barely tax this cpu atm.","the reason i don't care about the socket after i buy, is that i haven't replaced a cpu in a board since my pentium ii.","previous board had ddr3, so i was going to have to get new ram no matter what.","for me, by the time i would consider a new cpu, updated mobos are out, and those have upgraded features that i likely would also want.","previous box was about 6 years old, but truthfully, it was still fine.","something better is always around the corner, too expensive for me to chase that dragon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"personally, i feel intel needs to hold onto their platforms for longer.","minimum 3 years, ideally 4, or at least until some important technological feature needs to be implemented.","lga1700 brought both pcie 5.0 and ddr5, so technically it should be good for a while - look how long intel had been stuck with ddr4 and pcie 3.0 before that.","did they really need all those platform changes over the, like, decade?","anyhow, iâ€™ve never really subscribed to the â€œbuy a platform and keep upgrading itâ€ theory, but i also lived through the 90s and 00s of computers where everyone kept promising upgradability and it never happened.","in the end, it comes down to cost - so you have to buy a new motherboard; for someone with the cash to frequently upgrade is that the end of the world?","and if you plan on buying a good system and holding onto it for 5 years or so, do you need the promise of upgradability?",will technology have moved on by then anyways?,itâ€™s all just personal preference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd wait until next gen intel if that's your concern.,mainboard also needs to support future ddr5 speeds which is another issue for both amd and intel.,and just because you can put the cpu in and run it it doesn't mean you'll get the full speed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

buy what you like and have a budget for as both are fantastic platforms currently( intel and amd) for gaming period full stop.,do so purchasing the best components one can afford within ones said budget and enjoy.,cheers!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
realistically how often do you build a new system?,do you buy the latest cpu each year?,for most of us we hold a system for several years before deciding to upgrade.,which means we would need to replace virtually everything anyway.,if you need a new machine today then upgrade.,if you don't need a new machine then wait till you do.,"i've happily waited for 9 months for 13th gen, z790 and 4000/7000 series gpus.",but i could.,now it's time to build and wow are there se nice deals and new tech to choose from.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel does two generations.,"amd did two gens, with the third gen having issues with the original 300 series chipset.","i believe the 5800x3d was only supported by the a320 asrock boards, which created backlash.","so really, 2 gens vs 2.5 gens - and do you really intend to upgrade more than once every 3 years?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it really depends how you buy hardware.,if you want to keep your setup for less than 3 -4 years both are fine now.,more than 3-4 years get amd since they claim they will support am5 for a long time.,but also beware amd almost broke compatibility during am4 by having older motherboards not support zen3 even if it was the same socket.,i think the community complained and they did a one way beta bios update for old boards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this!,i'm still on a 2600k.,cpus don't need to be upgraded often.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is it worth it to go for z690 (less future proofed?),instead of z790?,i'm stuck choosing the asus prime -a mobos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wonder if that's part of why amd at the start didn't get as many nice motherboards early in ryzens life.,intel is the cream of the crop for mobo makers as they make a new socket every 2 years and get to sell more mother boards.,meanwhile amd let people upgrade b350 all the way to the 5800x3d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sad skylake noises.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you know, i was thinking the same thing.. but with the stupid 4mm thick ihs, yeah, that was the tipping point for me to return my amd build and go intel.","at 4k it doesn't matter anyway, or not enough to matter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which will only bring an advantage to gaming if you mostly use your pc for productivity then the intel 13th gen will likely be better still.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't see the longevity of z790 over z690.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
z790 offers more pci-e gen 4 lanes so you get 4 m2 nvme drives instead of 3 on z690.,more usb 3 20gbps ports.,that's the only difference.,i have msi z690 ddr4 tomahawk.,"compared to z790 version, it has all four m2 nvme at pcie gen4 and no usb 2.0 ports at rear.","they got usb 3 20gbps and more usb 3 5gbps

and vrm is at 90a vs 70a and cmos clear button.",wait for black friday or christmas sales.,if z690 is cheaper grab that.,gamer nexus mentioned this.,for value z690 is great it does everything.,just update bios before 13th gen cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
z790 has a few more advantages than just fast usbs.,"the higher spec ones have a pcie 5 m.2 slot for ssds faster than 7000.
they were designed with higher speed ddr5 in mind.",if shear speed and data throughput is important t to your workflow and you are happy paying the premium for those speedy components then go z790.,"if you are gaming you won't see a huge difference, buy z690 (that is my plan!)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
give me a three centimeter thick ihs and i don't care if it runs 95c.,if it is priced decently and performs well on average we should accept it.,x3d is nice but you can't overclock it which is half the fun.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wow you saved me days of reading and understanding the specs man.,i don't think 1 more m2 nvme drive is a deal breaker for me.,"also, is usb 3 20gbps and 5gbps a big deal?",i'm not sure how big of a difference is between 90a and 70a vrm.,i do remember gn said it's better to buy the z690 with a usb flash(something like that) so you don't need a 12gen cpu to boot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gaming only here.,i guess it won't make a huge difference,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the pcie 5.0 m.2 slot is not a z790 feature.,"itâ€™s more common on z790 boards, yes, but there are z690 boards with the exact same feature (implemented the same way as well).","one caution: if you do choose to make use of the 5.0 m.2 slot, your gpu will drop down to x8 lanes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
z690 boards typically have one usb 3.2 gen2x2 port (usually a front panel header).,z790 boards *can* but do not necessarily *do* have two.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm upgrading from 9700k/z390 to 13700k/msi z690-a ddr4.,jump in!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
one other consideration is aesthetics.,as our computers are showpieces these days if the z790 or z690 has the look you really want then go for it!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why not ddr 5?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

get your 230â£ and sell your motherbord + 10400f for like 180 and get the msi b660m-a and either a 12600kf or a 13600kf(whatever fits da budget) and make sure the store updates the bios first,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for that much money, i'd just use it to buy a 13th gen cpu if you have some more money to pay, or save for another generation.",11700k is worth the upgrade over 10500f nonetheless but just saying there's a better way to use that money.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 11700k is a good cpu (unlike the 11900k), but what would the cost be for you to get, say, a good b660 board and the 12600k or 13600k?",itâ€™s all about what you want to/can spend for a certain level of performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
big no.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
only if you desperately need pcie 4.0 and have some good reason not to upgrade the entire rig.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'd say try to go with 13th gen, for the 13600k if you can strech your budget.","12th is already much better than 11th gen, due to higher instructions per clock and more cores.",13th gen gets slight ipc improvements + higher  clocks and possibly important for gaming as the 5800x3d showed: more cache,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thank you,

both 12th gen models are across the board faster than the 1165g7, except if you need avx-512.",the 1260p is both faster in single thread and multi-thread by 10-25%.,however it uses quite a bit more power too.,"id go for the 1260p if you plan to use it mostly plugged in, and the 1255u if youre looking to wander around the office all day.",i would not buy the 1165g7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

just my opinion but 2 p cores is going to be painful in a few years.,i would say go 4p cores if you want to use that laptop for more than 3-4 years,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would the p processor also heat more than u processor?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

in canada the availability is pretty shit so far.,"a lot of z790 mobos are being ""released"" on the 28th for some reason.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it may be a combination of bad asus support and high price, thus no one wants to stock it?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wish micro center would expand to germany.,it would be awesome to walk into a store and come out with the hardware you want in your hands.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i guess its the same here in germany.,one shop says they maybe have the boards next week.,i hope that's true.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"idle temps should be in 30s, maybe close to 40c",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can you take a pic of what the cooling is?,the cpu is almost certainly not bad.,more likely alienware sized the cooler to an i3â€™s heat output and not an i7.,"if they offered an i7 at the time, it mightâ€™ve come with a beefier cooler.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they do offered the i7 variant with the same form factor.,i do believe the fan are all the same due to the size of this machine.,"the first attempt is iâ€™m using the spread method, second time iâ€™m using the dot method.",i already closed mine up but the system looks like the one in this article.,https://www.engadget.com/2014-12-12-alienware-alpha-review.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"okay, to be frank, for a micro system like that your temperatures are probably to be expected.",do you know if the tdps can be adjusted?,"it might have trouble expelling high levels of heat, leading to overall warmer temps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i went to bios and there is no option to adjust tdp.,"i believe thats why they went with the t variant, its only take 35w max.","when it have i3 in it, the fans barely noticeable.","with i7 sometimes its ramps up, something that i never experienced with the i3.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i can vouch for a 12700k but if i was looking for one new today it would be the 13700k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

manufacturers cant control retailer pricing.,"if retailers feel like they can get more money, they will sell it for higher than the msrp.","historically there is usually a price hike by retailers at launch, before they settle into msrp a month or so later.","microcenter even undercuts the msrp and is selling the 13900k for $569
https://www.microcenter.com/product/652624/intel-core-i9-13900k-raptor-lake-30ghz-twenty-four-core-lga-1700-boxed-processor-heatsink-included

so clearly retailers can make money at or below msrp, they just are usually greedy when it comes to in-demand products",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
anyoneâ€™s free to sell them for what they think they can get (see: gpus until recently).,apparently micro center had them in-store for $570.,"in canada, canada computers and best buy have them for the equivalent of $585.",although i donâ€™t see them currently available.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

manfacturer's suggested retail price.,"it is a *suggestion*, not a ceiling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"everyone will tell you that the $589 is not msrp or that itâ€™s for bulk orders, but, the prices for 12th gen didnâ€™t drop too much in price and stores want to sell their stock.",it wonâ€™t be a smart move to place both the 13900k and 12900k at the same price.,"at some point the prices will go down, we just need to be patientâ€¦

i bought one 12900k 3 weeks ago for â‚¬690 and today one 13900k for â‚¬750, both because of work.","if you need it now, $50 is not with the wait for weeks imo.","if you can wait, the prices almost always will go down.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"msrp = manufacturer's *suggested* retail price

it's just a suggested price to sell the product for a decent overall profit margin while not losing consumer faith in the process.","unfortunately, some resellers are greedy and will hike prices up (as you see with the 13900k), in hopes to make even more money while they move inventory from hype sales.",customers tend to lose faith with this practice and it's why the custom pc market is steadily on the decline.,"fiscally speaking, the worst time to ever buy a processor, video card, or console is at its launch lol.",patient consumers understand the above and will just wait as supply ticks up and the sticker price gradually declines.,there are those of us that go one step further and wait for prices to drop well below even msrp which can save you hundreds (in some cases thousands).,let's be real though - retailers still make a profit dropping the price below msrp as typically the wholesale/invoice price of a unit can be as much as 3x less that of the msrp.,i'd wager the invoice price for the 13900k is probably around $200 per unit (or less).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is called the manufacturerâ€™s â€˜suggestedâ€™ retail price for a reason.,it is just a â€˜suggestionâ€™,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

nope.,3600 mhz cl14 and 4000 mhz cl16 still can compete with almost high and ddr5s.,"for most of scenarios, difference is max %3 ~ %5.","and yes, ddr5s have long way to go, imo, at least 2 years to be real strong against ddr4.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you are technically already bottlenecking with 3600 cl18, probably missing out on a 15%+ gain compared to cl14 4000mt ddr4.",ddr5 would not be worth the costs anyway.,you'd get more putting the money towards rtx 4080/7800 xt.,"as for ddr4 vs ddr5, they are very close comparing best to the best except in some odd cases (rt cyberpunk and spiderman).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there have been a few reviewers that have tested ddr4 vs ddr5.,"if you buy a very high end ddr5 kit (like ddr5-6400cl32) with a 13700k, youll lose about 5-8% performance on average in games vs ddr4-3600, with a 4090 at 1080p.","which is a modest amount but in an extremely unlikely situation, but when you look at the cost of those high end ddr5 kits reviewers use, it ends up being $200-$300...

personally i would not recommend going for ddr5 yet, especially when you already have a ddr4 board and ddr4.","when pricing comes down, and speeds go up in a year or two, then it will make sense, but imo most people should stick to ddr4 right now unless they are pairing it with like a 4090.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that could explain it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
let me repeat myself.,"not 13th gen or ryzen 7000. when you have to nitpick games, its not an ""average loss in games"".","and i dunno where you live, but 4133mhz c15 ddr4 is not something thats especially cheap to come across here.","if you already got the thing, thats nice.","if not, then it still costs money.",and is still not the same platform.,my whole point was that what he said about losing 5-8% on average in games using ddr5 with 13th gen cpus is wrong.,the charts he referenced himself showed the exact opposite.,"if you have different usecases, already own the good ddr4 etc, of course this changes your priorities.",but it does not change the fact that ddr5 isnt some automatic loss in performance on 13th gen. ddr5 isnt coming for you.,its getting better all the time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

are z690 boards giving higher sp values in general than z790??,"&#x200b;

cause my sp score on a asus rog strix z790-f for my 13900k is 98 overall and 107 p cores and 80 e-cores.",almost all i have read have higher sp scores.,"&#x200b;

i know sp score is just a guess and not a be end all and wonder if z690 boards have a harder time calculating real value and are overinflating it as most seem to be using z690 boards with 13900k",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are they hurting p core overclocking potential as your p core sp score is slightly better.,the e-core sp score who cares as i disable those cores anyways.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
z690 rog hero.,how do i know it's bugged?,and how do i fix that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1.45v-6.2ghz+4.0ghz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i donâ€™t think so .,when i first tried it in my z690 i had a sp score of 121 and when i switched it in my z790 i had a sp score of 125 .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah they are.,itâ€™s a bios glitch.,once you update bios you have to remove your cpu and put it back in and youâ€™ll get the real score.,mine was sp125 then i updated it and removed the cpu and reinstalled it and i got the real sp score of sp103.,on overclockers.,com one of the main ocâ€™ers has tested about 100 chips and the highest real sp he got was 118. he was the one that posted you need to update bios and then remove and reinstall to get actual number.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
flash the latest bios (2103 or 2201beta) and update me firmware.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how do you even cool a 13900k at 1.45v?,:o are you running direct-die cooling?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so i guess e core sp score does matter even if you disable the e-waste cores and use p cores only but want to overclock p cores as much as possible with lowest voltage and best thermals as possible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and then reseat cpu it'll work,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

how would you lose any single core performance if e-cores are off.,and why would one e-core help.,"&#x200b;

with e-cores off the 13900k is a super 8 core 16 thread chip quite a bit better in fact than the 7700x as the p cores of intel are better than amd zen 4 at same clock speed and they clock higher too.","update:

well someone over at [overclock.net](https://overclock.net) did say that somehow thee-cores being off totally did hurt single thread performance due to some arch change or arch and having 1 e-core on gets rud of that.",i tested that on win10 and got same exact cpu-z and cinebench single core score so did not see this bug.,"&#x200b;

apparently the thread director causes issues and starts doing everything wrong with e-cores disabled.","&#x200b;

unfortunately you cannot disabled the thread director.","however if you use win10, the thread director is effectively disabled as win10 cannot interact with it.",so this issue appears on 12th gen as well.,so with win10 it should not be a problem at all with all e-cores off on 12th or 13th gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the 13400 model can come in either alder lake c0 and raptor lake b0 variants.","i suppose than both versions would use a different sspec so that we can differentiate between both versions, correct?","i don't want to state i see this as confusing educated consumers, cause of course i will want the best version with raptor cove higher ipc cores and tweaked silicon properties, even if the increase is minimal.",5 - what we can expect about avx-512 support on raptor lake?,"yes, i know that there are issues regarding p-cores and e-cores having different isa support, but on alder lake, there were users that would disable e-cores to use avx-512, and even stick to old bios/microcode versions to do so when you decided to drop avx-512 entirely.","besides, this choice of not having avx-512 enabled seems to be entirely windows centric.",i'm expecting than an user on linux with manual thread pinning should be theorically able to use both p-cores with avx-512 and e-cores enabled.,why you don't give advanced users the choice instead of just making avx-512 units effectively dark silicon?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i am interested in some questions regarding intel policies.","for example, linus torvalds critique and what intel plans to do about this.",he has directly blamed intel for certain problems in the **industry**.,another topic is about communication.,"usually, when vendors are more open to consumers, they are more accepting of mistakes, delays and other issues.",intel here shows that it hasn't aged well as an organization and is a bit disconnected of what the world wants it to be (personal opinion).,one obvious example is that you are not allowed on commenting future products.,"instead of saying you don't comment on future products, you could say: 'we are trying it out, but at this point of time we don't know how it will affect final product'.","you don't need to say what alternative (if better) you are trying, but more openness would be (i think) seen positively and would improve intel's image.",are there any plans to provide intel branded risc-v designs?,"(and again, commenting on future products prevents you to say anything)

cpu usage went up possibly because in lower resolution it uses a translation layer to turn older dx instructions into newer ones.,with higher fps it has to do that more and causes more overhead on the cpu.,my guess is this is also why it is more competitive vs 3060/6600 at 1430/4k.,it doesn't have as big a hit to overhead.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

at certain wattages.,a video linked here showed at 260w load it was 7c and the gap would probably continue to grow above that.,but 260w is already a ton for any air cooler.,the u12a will handle gaming fine though but if they want to say render with unlocked power limits it may not be the greatest.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 i dont know why-- i don't over clock -- i like a cool quiet machine.,"but in spite of that, i still like it when others do.",i think this is cool.,that is actually truly amazing.,i could only image what's going to happen when intel catchs up on node.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if it's not on air or clc; who cares; it is pointless,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
goddamit i see this motherboard being teased everywhere and yet no release date or product pages anywhere,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
awesome record.. and this is on raptor cove core which have the best and most efficient instructions per clock and best single threaded performance right now at least in x86 space making it all the more awesome.,"&#x200b;

where as those amd fx chips while they clocked high and broke a record then in 2014, they were absolute garbage in terms of instructions per clock and efficiency and overall performance, so it was kind of meh then as amd was just awful awful then in like everything!",!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how soon did it reach 100â°c and throttle?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"probably till next amd/intel gen, they are battling each other who get the 'magical' 6ghz boost first lol (assuming someone doesn't push current gen few mhz higher)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its technically an nhd15 so it should hold it together.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
let me know how that goes with the u12a.,thats what i'm planning to do as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you think the u12a can handle the 13700k ?,"i imagined it would until i saw reviews, now i'm a bit worried lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

to demonstrate to the customer that the product is reliable and has gone through rigorous testing.,that there is ample headroom as long as enough cooling is available.,customers who rely on accuracy and speed of calculations can be assured that the product will perform.,i think i tend to take for granted that our pc will work just fine and reliably for all these years.,for years i just left my i7 930 pegged at 4.0ghz 1.38v and no race to idle set.,still works just as new.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
irrelevant this is on ln2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it never even went above negative 20 c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah i wondering if i need to upgrade to that one (but its pretty big) or go w/ bequiet or scythe or who knows, but i like air.","and i want the u12a to be able to handle it, cause its pretty magical.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah will do, iâ€™ve been using it on 12600k and iâ€™m a big noctua fangirl, so iâ€™m confident it can handle the 13900k, but its a hot boy, so weâ€™ll see.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think it will but iâ€™ll try it on the 13900k on monday and see what happens and report back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so if im liquid cooled and someone else has hit thermal ceiling and im clocked higher than they are bc they are using an air cooler is that also irrelevant?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
from the reviews i've seen the margin being between the two is like -2c and some even claim its equal or even better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
derbauer put out a nice video on power limiting the chip and not losing a ton of performance by doing that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"hey, how did your cooler hold up against the 13900k?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i enjoy the attempt to play devil's advocate but no.,ln2 is used for short term competition/bragging rights and leader boards.,watercooling and air cooling are used by consumers.,good luck clocking higher than ln2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if tour not looking to overclock there's no need to get a super expensive overclocking board.,go with one that fits your hardware.,does it have enough usb?,pci 4?,does it handle the ram speeds you have.,i personally am in the same boat as you.,i ended up going with the rog strix-f.   to answer your question save the money and go with the carbon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
take a look at the board spec and decide yourself whether you need the extra feature on hero board or not.,personally i was going for msi mpg carbon but only asus board was available.,ended up with z790 strix e.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i went with the gigabyte aorus master just because it was between that and a few asus options at my mc yesterday (for ddr5 at least).,i had a major problem with asus' rma department this year and vowed to never buy their products again.,the build quality on this motherboard is 5x that of my old asus dark hero at the same price point.,the ez-latch m.2 and gpu system are clever and welcome.,tons of usb.,3 usb-c. 4 m.2 slots.,the board overall just feels like better build quality.,it's stout and heavy.,the heatsinks for the m.2 drives also feel like they are better quality.,overall very happy with my purchase so far.,"in my opinion, the gunmetal blue aesthetic also looks nice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the hero and carbon are pretty different - both in features and price.","there is, however, almost zero practical difference between the z690 hero and z790, basically one extra rear usb port and swapping a 3.0 m.2 slot for a 4.0. so if the older version is cheaper than the newer, it might make sense.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
anyone giving the asrock boards a looksy?,i donâ€™t know much about them but i hear most of the time their boards are pretty ok.  i was looking at either the asus maximum 790 hero or asrockâ€™s 790 taichai.,the asus board is like another $200 but seems to have similar features as the taichai board,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah, its hard to cool it.",i'm using arctic lf ii 360 argb rev 3 with thermalright 12th gen bracket.,the metal bracket on the cooler itself is a really tight fit with little to no clearance with the vrm heatsink.,"i ended up with mce disabled, 55x core muliplier all core, pl1 225, llc 4, dc\_ll 1.02, ac\_ll 0.2, ia vr voltage limit 1700.

what memory are you guys going for?,the best available in my country is corsair 6000 mhz with cl 40.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the response.,i'm using the same cooler but only just ordered the thermal right bracket.,had to mod the cooler by removing the cover and dremelling the tops of the bracket arms.,replaced the fans for noctua 3k rpm ones.,also getting 5.2-5.3 in cinebench whereas most people on the overclock forum seem to be able to get 5.7 allcore stable for a 30 minute cb run.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6400 cl32 on xmp.,"its a hynix die, should be overclockable to 7000 range but i'll get to it once im happy with with my cpu thermal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep same 6400 cl32 on xmp.,"apparently the board will easily go higher, but also still focusing on the cpu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i looked at that one as well.,but i just can't do a silver motherboard.,would throw everything off,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you don't care about rgb get the tomahawk if you can wait 3 days.,it has like 8-9 usb ports.,flashback and clear bios buttons.,not to mention everything else the other higher end boards have.,it's a good deal for 319,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i bought 6400 gskill trident.,32 cl.,got it on sale for 250 as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cl 40 is pretty high if you can get 5600-5800 at a lower cl that would be better then that 6000. cl40,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i dont think its the fan that is the problem, most probably just clearance issue with the vrm heatsink or just asus being asus with its generous voltage, i still couldnt tell if it actually sit properly.",i have like 4 p-core thermal throttle while the rest is not at stock pl 253  clock from 5.4-5.3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks i will keep a note of it.,i can actually wait 15-20 days tbh as my bb order wonâ€™t even be here till next week and even after that i am in no rush.,am hoping we see some low key deals close to bf.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for your advice.,i was able to find one with those specs!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the guys on the overclock forum all say its the best 360mm and that it should be enough to run an all core overclock of above 5.5. interestingly going to the 3k fans didn't make a massive difference, so i think it's the contact with the chip that's an issue rather than radiator size or fan power.","so i think it's the motherboard that's the issue, but don't have another one to test the chip on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
goodluck!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i suspected that as well but the temp drop really fast to high 30s once i ended cb.,either my pull config is subpar for this thick radiator since i can hardly feel any warm air from it.,edit: seems like the 4th time reseat the cooler did the trick.,i no longer thermal throttle in cb23.,i re-tighten all the screw on the cooler.,tighten the cooler standoff but the headroom to run above 5.5 is too small for my comfort.,i'll stay at stock speed for now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh wow ok so you did get it to work.,"so you have the backplate, then the little plastic sticky rings, then the metal offsets, and the thermalright 1700 frame, right?",and did you tighten the cooler to maximum tightness or did you do something special in the way you did it this time that got it to no longer throttle at stock cb23?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sorted.,"added the thermalright plate, reseated and stuck on a thin new layer of kryonaught, now happily maxes out at 84c at the 250w stock limit.",definitely a compatibility issue with the board and cooler.,got there in the end..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"same, its the first aio i used where i need to put a lot of force to make it sit on the standoff.",i'm using the same paste and getting the same result at stock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it is the same socket, but you do not need one unless you have issues.",i personally did not benefit from it at all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just dont use it..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you don't need to, however, you might want to consider if your temp is crazy high in stress testing.",i bought one anyways.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"none of the current contact frames claim 13th gen support but i know they should work, just weird they wouldn't mention 13th gen being it would obviously improve sales.","also this comment in another thread made me realize its possible the frames might not work properly with 13th gen (but no confirmation yet obviously) - ""no, the issue would be if intel made the pcb on 13th gen thicker, but the die and ihs thinner which is possible with how intel makes these cpus and has happened before with 8th, 9th, and 10th gen. coolers were still compatible but any kind of frame was not.""",edit: toms hardware tested the thermalright frame on a msi z690 + 13600k & asus z690 + 13900k and did see an improvement with the 13600k / msi combo: https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/thermalright-lga1700-bcf-contact-frame,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i ordered one for this build.,"an 8 to 10c difference was seen from so many different reviews, why not spend $10 and give it a shot?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
guys below don't know what they are talking about.,the lg 1700 socket has issues with the top of the heatsink being uneven when mounting it in the socket.,"this can cause varying degree of temp issues that have been identified by several tech reviewers, even gamers nexus.",obviously not everyone who buys a 12/13 gen cpu is going to have this problem but the cpu contact frame is a good purchase because it solves them mounting pressure point issues that can cause this.,buying the thermalright contact frame for $17 is in my opinion a reasonable purchase because it can help improve temps by up to 10c which can mean the difference between thermal throttling and not (this has been verified and proven via testing).,i bought the thermal grizzly one just because i like their products and support der8auer.,i like the fact that you purchased it and think you should stick with it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and you pushed the clock speed ?,if you did  how hot did it run it sid it not?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how would you know if you have issues?,"sorry if thatâ€™s a dumb question, just not sure what test to run to see if i actually would benefit from it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
didn't benefit from  it using 12th gen or 13th gen cpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,leave cpu in box,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"12th, it's just snake oil unless you have a very specific problem with your system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well you may have nit properly set  your cpu in the socket bc a a 10 mire ir less decrease in temps is definitely with using 12th gen should ve required to it idk what you were doing once it was set proper snd used a frame that should have veen stock on these mb niw anyway seeing 5.4 all core idle in the liw 20s and cinabench hight 50s low 60 yeah you right stay away it does nothing lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i got a 0 degree difference, tested with 3 different coolers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and did you once think of checking cpu's ihs geometry?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20a is similar to 4 in that it seems to be a stripped down stopgap node that will never be produced in very high volume.,the high volume ones are planned as 3 and 18a.,"there's a reason intel has been quoting 2025 as the timeline for improving market position: 18a with lnl, dmr, and ifs availability.","i wouldn't trust this much though, and arl-p was the one previously leaked as being n3.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol are intel fabs not capable of euv by arrow lake?,thatâ€™s really sad of thatâ€™s true,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
asml has a big backlog in terms of equipment delivery.,it could be that intel does not want another disruption so they found a compromise.,i am speculating like everyone here but i do not see this as a disaster.,i see it as a stop gap until their tools are ready for more than intel chips.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how come amd support am5 until 2025?,while intel change socket every 2 years is the reason like more of a greed or something?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wouldn't it also make more sense that if they were having ""trouble"" and wanted to outsource process, that they would use the ""troublesome"" internal process for the high power sku's and outsource the portable sku's?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol what?,who said anything about them not being euv?,"their intel 4 already uses around the same amount of euv as tsmc 5nm with intel 3 increasing euv layers even more, you think they'll revert back to duv with 20a?",just because desktop doesn't use 20a doesn't mean it's late or it's another disaster just yet.,20a goes into production in 2024 so maybe they just want to get arrow lake desktop out earlier.,and it's not completely outlandish nowadays for a new node to be slightly behind optimized last gen nodes in terms of performance(ghz) metrics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
really hoping it isn't true.,it's a disaster for intel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel isn't buying nearly as much euv equipment as they should, tho.",they won't be able to produce anything that requires euv in any meaningful amount unless they change that policy soon.,they even let go the first high na euv machine they tooted they bought.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not sure.,"desktop chips seem to be larger on the highest end, which could cause yield issues.","another thought, there may not be the traditional clear splits between desktop and mobile when we're just talking about a compute tile.",also - n3 or n3e?,probably n3e if it's a 2024 product being planned now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my point is that, i was hoping they didnâ€™t have to rely on tsmc by then",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the 5.4ghz is the â€œregularâ€ maximum turbo boost that youâ€™ll see during use.,"note that this normally depends on how many cores are active, and the best info i can find is that the 13900k all-core speeds are 5.2ghz p-core and 4.1ghz e-core, however thatâ€™s only from one source.","for single threaded workloads, 2 â€œpreferredâ€ cores can boost to 5.7 ghz.","finally, if the cpu is under 70 degrees with a light workload, an additional modest â€œthermal velocity boostâ€ (specified here as 100mhz, but on alder lake you could also make it 200mhz) can be added on top of all of these frequencies, giving you the maximum of 5.8ghz.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not everything is about performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you think a750 is a gpu for playing games?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no such thing as too much.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this entirely depends on what the user wants to do.,there are many valid reasons why someone would want a high end cpu but doesn't care about having the highest end gpu.,"virtual machines, cpu intensive software, etc.",the a750 is perfectly fine for games.,source: i have one.,"granted, i use linux and older directx games through dxvk have been great.","i genuinely don't suggest getting one right now if you use windows unless it's purely for workstation purposes because of its older dx api emulation, but that'll be improved with updates, because dxvk proves high performance translation is possible, it's just that microsoft's implementation is garbage right now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yes, it works pretty well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's because the regular contact frame doesn't always provide the best contact for cpu coolers.,"thermal grizzly and der8aur (and others, but i don't know their names off the top of my head) have made contact frames to make sure the coolers are able sit level on the and provide full contact to the cpu's ihs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most of the people buying arc gpus are buying them to support more competition in the gpu space.,they're buying it in the hopes that intel sees it as a viable project and don't immediately shelf it.,let the person buy whatever they want.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i bought it for my plex server (my excuse) and to tinker with and game on occasionally because i just love tech oddities.,i do want to use av1 for my videos on my server and the arc is the king for that.,"though i do realize it's probably a bad use case, i still am having fun.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i would like to encode av1, but i'm very new and haven't found a way on the gpu.",let me know if you know any.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can buy the budget arc card for that purpose then.,not that av1 is even that useful yet.,meteor lake cpus are also going to have av1 hardware encoders built into them too iirc.,"in terms of streaming twitch will not support av1 till 2025, youtube has no public plans, though they have already started using it for *some* normal videos.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

esd can degrade a lot of electronics without straight up breaking them.,"components keep working but their lifetime is shortened, i don't know the mechanisms behind this but i have seen it happen a lot with dsps if you aren't careful, like when you don't implement correctly esd protocols and have fewer dsp (because they keep dying due to uknown reasons) than converters so you have to plug and unplug the dsps a lot for testing of the converter.",then one day you make everyone that even thinks of going to the lab the full esd gear and dsps stop dying on us or our clients.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

running the latest bios.,after reading about inflated sp ratings and the way to fix it is by removing and reseating the cpu with bios reset i decided to do that.,now my sp rating is true.,it's 97 with 101 on the p cores and 80 on the ecores.,was too good to be true !,[gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|disapproval),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think thereâ€™s more to it then that (vid table math): https://youtu.be/olpjn4q3ygi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol same here just 3 points worse 109/73 overall 97 those shitty ecores definitely affect overclocking potential!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did recently get a response from an experienced overclocker about it.,"i asked him: "" with my e-core sp rating at 76, will that impact my build tuning much, or can i get away with it?""","they said this: ""with a low sp e-core rate you may have some ring/llc clock limitation and e-core frequency limitation, but you need to try... sometimes you can find the bad e-cores and limit them.""",so it looks like we just need to experiment with the clock speeds and see how they do.,"i'm following his guide, it's a lot to read but looks to be worth it in the end.",the overclockers post/guide for beginners if you're interested:  https://www.overclock.net/threads/asus-maximus-z790-extreme-and-intel-i9-13900k-a-tuning-guide-for-beginners.1801569/#post-29055947,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ddr5 is *never* going to run gear 1 on any future intel cpu.,"for example, in order to run ddr5 6800 (brand new kits) the imc would have to run at over 3400mhz.",thatâ€™s not possibleâ€¦ currently they have issues breaking 2000.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i don't even have the option with my newest bios, just gear 2 and 4",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ddr5 is designed to run with the memory controller at half the memory frequency, unlike ddr4.",it's unlikely that you'd see a performance improvement even if it could run in gear 1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ryzen 5 was already doa when it was released regardless of raptor lakeâ€™s release.,who in their right mind would pair a crazy expensive am5 mobo and ddr5 ram with a 300dollar 6c12t cpu that also gets trounced by its own am4 cousin 5800x3dâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"7600 was dead the moment it was launched, i knew 13600k would take it to town in both value and performance

"if you can boot at 4000 cl15, it will be very competitive with fast ddr5, and much cheaper.",cl14 even more so.,"the reason to go with ddr5 at this point is if you need 32gb, since you will have a hard time pairing up fast memory and reaching 32gb with ddr4.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"pairing 13600 with ddr4 will waste some of it's potential, 600 series ddr5 motherboards are barely a few more $ compared to ddr4 equivalents and ddr5 prices are falling each day.",makes sense to go ddr5 in my opinion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i am retiring my 2500k sandy bridge for 13600k.,"back then there wasn't really another huge jump after sandy bridge,  but now if i sum up all the previous gen and now huge leap with raptor lake it is about 100% performance increase in 1-2-3-4core and even bigger in 8-core/64.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

its a stupid buy at current motherboard prices but its not that stupid of a buy once things settle down a bit.,you have to remember.,raptor lake is the end of the line as things stand for the lga1700 socket.,am5 meanwhile is only just starting.,"you are likely looking at zen 4 3d parts, zen 5 and zen 5 3d parts at the minimum still to come with zen 5 being touted as a grounds-up new microarchitecture.",both have its place in the market and that's a good thing.,as for the 5800x3d.,people need to lay of the crack on that one and that goes for both sides.,its a fast cpu on a cheap platform no doubt about it but the cpu itself is not cheap.,its still a 400$ product or more in the eu and its not better than zen 4. it wins some specific games but its not magic.,there are games where it gains little and games where it gains nothing.,zen 4 on average comes out faster.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"similar thoughts here, coming from a five year old 7700k/z270 with 32gb corsair vengeance 3600 and i feel like a ddr5 set would be too early, on the other hand a ddr4 with a z-board would feel a bit half-baked with this ddr4 kit especially when the 13600k as stock is already so good.","a budget msi 660b costs half as much as z690 where i live, so why not hop into that, carry the existing ram over and consider a ddr5 board two years in, when it offers tangible upgrade at reasonable costs?","i've ordered a 13600k today, btw.",:),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"let's say intel loses in gaming to the 7800x3d ok. that still won't stop the 13600k from being the best all around mid-range  cpu of 2022.

unlikely.,the 13100f is an alder lake part.,in fact everything below the 13600k is.,i think your expecting a but too much from intel here.,the 7600x is not that bad in gaming.,its close to the 13600k for the most part even though it falls appart in production.,its unrealistic to think a 4c/8t i3 would beat it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

sure it can.,7800x3d will be very expensive ($500 is very possible).,and all it can do is game.,"production wise, even the 13600k will be better.",so the 7800x3d needs to be at least 20% better in game than the 13600k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

my biggest question is if a 3d version of zen 4 would even be that much better.,like a 5800x non 3d had only 36mb of cache.,so a jump to 100mb in the 3d version was massive.,"the 7950x already has 80mb, and even intel with their 13900k went to 68mb compared to 12900k which only had 44mb.","people are expecting a massive jump like there was last time, but they near tripled the cache of the 5800x to get that result, it won't be the same this time around.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't think many people realize that cache provides diminishing returns.,it's not a free +20% performance button,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it will be interesting to see if it can be cooled.,"the chips already run hot, adding some cache layer will be challenging.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not to mention raptor lake supports way faster ddr5 memory than zen 4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">the 7950x already has 80mb

that isn't stacked ""3d vcache"" and the 7950x isn't the target, most likely the 7800x3d which would again triple the cache of the 7700x (32mb) also a single ccx.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
people also dont realize that 5800x3d is operating at lower speeds ddr4.,"with zen4, most are high speed ddr5 which actually kinda lowers the 3d cachr performance added baseline.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ram speed was mostly irrelevant with the 5800x3d.,will likely follow suite with zen 4.  the cache does all the heavy lifting and the slower ram can easily catch up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that was more the case years ago.,"now, depending on game and mode (vr, etc) you might get one core maxing out but the other cores will certainly not be idle.",common sense says this cpu will run hot both by it's power consumption compared to older cpus but also by is solid increase in performance.,"from the few detailed reviews i have seen the performance gains are respectable, especially compared to older gen like the 10900.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"update:

had to do a fresh install of win 11.

so it actually turns out that the reason i was getting these stopcodes is because i normally run windows on my nvme, but i actually somehow forgot that i have an hdd and old evo 850 ssd in sata port 1 and 2 respectively, and during my installation of the bios, windows reassigned those drive letters, namely my c: drive from my nvme to my hdd, causing a bunch of chaos and corruption.","so now, iâ€™m about to get a couple more m.2 drives (should have done that a while ago) because of this.",so annoying.,lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if you have multiple drives that are going to be the same size install windows with only one drive connected.,once you're all done installing and setting up windows install the secondary drives after.,then boot up and go into diskmgr and assign your drive letters or reformat any old data off of them.,windows installer is ass at identifying your drives if they are all the same size.,it can be hard to tell them apart.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

awful timings lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
question.,let's say i get a 13700 with ddr5 now.,"in the future can i upgrade ram and exceed the current jedec speeds without over/under, basically without touching anything and letting it go stock?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ddr4 timings are awful compared to ddr3 timings.,"since timings are everything to you, you still run ddr3 and it's better than ddr4 and ddr5 builds right?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tell me you know nothing about ram without telling me you know nothing about ram.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
learn timings lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i totally agree, i expected tighter timings and higher megatransfer numbers, this is basically releasing the same crap all over again and again and again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i dont think you fully understand what youre asking.,"anything past jdec is considered overclocking, xmp is an overclock.","but yes, you can buy cheaper ddr5-4800 today, and drop in ddr5-7200+ in the future.","these very high end kits (7800+) will depend on the board and imc you have, so they are not a guarantee (nothing over jdec is a guarantee, but 7200 is in the realm of reason, 8000 is going to be hard to run)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it depends on how good the imc is.,same reason you can't stick ddr4 4000 cl14 into a ryzen 2700x or i7 7700k build and expect it to run.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,13700k(?),supports up to ddr5-5600.,anything above that is technically overclocked.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's not what i'm referring to lol.,jesus this sub.,"timings should be more like 34-35-34-32 at ddr5 7000.

the latency of that ram is going to be horrible, i can do better at 6000mt which would result in better game performance.",now do you understand?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how about actually use ddr5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ok awesome, to put into context i got a 6 series i7 that uses 2133 ram and im stuck there, so i want to confirm if i can get a 13 series cpu, and use a higher speed in the future than 5600 ram without having to do anything other than simply putting the ram into the board",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm confused 34-35-34-32 shouldn't that be like  34-35-34-69 unless i missed some magic the tras should be about 69-70 and not lower then cl.,unless you meant something different then how it's normally typed for the 4th timing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you will have to enable xmp, and it will depend on your motherboards trace layout.",a kit like 8000cl38 is probably z790 apex or nothing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you will also need a new board.,6 series uses 170 chipset and also a different socket which arenâ€™t compatible with 13 series cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nah, tuned, on intel, bring tras down to 28 if possible, this drops trc.","but yes, default, it comes high.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i'm talking new pc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've always heard tras lower then trcd+tcl doesn't help performance at all and may add negative impacts.,did you test bandwidth before and after and notice any changes by dropping tras well below normal?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with am4 i didn't get gains going sub 30 (some people do 21).,"with intel, since trc can't be set, we rely on just lowering the tras.",it's mostly for dropping the latency slightly.,programs that are used to test this quickly are aida64/intel imc gui/winrar and dota2.,i'd be down to test tomorrow once i receive my 13700kf.,"also ring ratio with intel matters with dropping latency, as well as the p-core ghz value.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ah interesting my last intel was 10th gen so i have not followed overclocking mem on the newer stuff since.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ahh ok ty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's what intel sent them.,i7 reviews are going to be from retail purchased processors.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"is there a reason for this, or is this fairly common practice to not send the i7?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they've done this for several generations.,"historically the i7 has been extremely close to i9 performance, but at a significant cost advantage.",i'd guess they want to showcase their halo and upsell people into buying the halo 8p-core cpu rather than the value 8p-core option.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah, i gotcha, that makes sense.",thank you for explaining that to me.,this will be my first upgrade and i plan to go from an i5-6600 to an i7-13700k so the lack of initial reviews was throwing me off.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

doesn't amd recommend 5600?,not 5200?,"also why does intel get 5600, when it doesn't even need that?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is it really worth having these chips ship out of the box with such high power consumption when majority of the performance is available at much much less power consumption?,it still handily beats the amd chips at their stock power limits and could use less than 100 watts while doing so?,seems like easy headlines.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

how does the consumption compare to 13700k at that point?,i.e.,is it just smarter to get the 13700k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's pretty interesting.,i'm curious whether the scaling up the line is from the additional cores (do these games effectively use 24 cores?),or better bins allowing higher p-core frequency.,i'm guessing mostly frequency.,also a good demo that the headline power numbers for everything only matter for productivity tasks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"indeed, judging the thermals of a cpu with just one case scenario (100% all core workload) is like if they made a performance review just making a multicore run of cinebench.","the same way they test performance in different applications, for obvious reasons, they should report the power usage / thermals as well.","alder lake for example runs games cooler than zen 3, yet the majority of people think that intel is more power hungry and harder to cool because all they see are these tech tubers benching thermals with cinebench / blender.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"playing devil's advocate here, maybe they got a dud?","their power scaling chart had atrocious scores, lower at 125w than what several other reviews are getting at 65w.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sadly clowning intel and nvidia gives more views.,"today's thumbnail is a joke for example, while when amd cpu's get thermally limited in 8 seconds, then ""it just works as intended, move on"".","however the 7950x review was a majestic ""performance king"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this hub guys cowered to the fanboys.,he needs to keep delivering red meat to the bulk of his viewers and keep them happy.,"if it costs some honesty point, hub is happy to make that sacrifice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"its almost like there are a lot of variables to factor in across different reviews, especially when cpus are so close and trades punches based on workload/game",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
look at derbauer's video which has non gaming also.,"at 90w limits, it matches 7950x on efficiency and stomps 12900k on efficiency.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whether gaming is important or not flip flops every month,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"true, the 13900k consumes around 110-120w when gaming at stock.",non gaming application numbers are probably more interesting at lower power caps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most people build pcâ€™s for gaming,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> games don't use much cpu power to begin with.,tell that to star citizen.,"no joke it will max out my 5900x sometimes in the hub areas with an average usage of 70-85%, least for the first 20 or so minutes until shaders compile and it drops to around 70+.","that game is next level cpu hunger, the likes of which i've never seen before.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wait what?,13600k is on par with it in gaming while crushing it in everything else.,"if you are already in am4 then yeah, get a 5800x3d for gaming.","but if you are building a new system, 13600k is a much better proposition.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't think so.,"the 13600k and even the the last gen 12700k perform better in gaming on average in this ltt review:

https://youtu.be/3zccx7yyiz4?t=420",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no ?,"5800x3d is 400

i5 is 13 th gen is 300",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yea, even amd have headaches because of it (becuase it performs better than some of their newer chips), they treat it as a bastard child.",edit: removing the 5800x3d from their 5000-7000 series comparison charts and acting like it doesn't exist during the 7000 series lauch is enough proof for that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you are playing anything over 1080p, it really doesn't matter much at all which cpu you go with.",all these reviews comparing cpus with 5-10fps increase claiming to smash the competition and then you move to 4k and none of it matters.,i always find it funny because the people that will actually see the (small) benefits are the people on 1080p who mostly likely don't even buy this stuff.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"repeat it a few times, maybe you manage to convince yourself.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no..   gaming loads typically would be between 60-100w.,you'd have to have all cores pegged at 100% usage with very heavy cpu intensive application to get close to that 250w tdp.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> the 13700k got tdp of 125w and turbo of 253wz that means that he will use all the time 253w?,"no, it will only hit high power draw numbers when running stuff that produces a lot of heat.",cinebench runs quite hot compared to games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can limit power draw to 90w also and performance is not reduced that much.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4bm0wr6oeq,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
look at the power usage during game in the same cb review.,short answer: around 125w,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you (most of the time) need all core workloads to reach that

but not all workloads are the same, for example on my underclocked 11700f system, aida64 fpu stress draws more power than whatever cinebench tests i run.",and something like prime95 is supposed to draw a fair bit more than these tests too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
zen 4 is pretty decent.,much higher efficiency than 13th gen and came out earlier.,3d v cache is just gives a huge boost to gaming.,"wait for the 7000 series 3d v cache chip, it will be impressive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
single core performance might improve when setting low power limits because it allows one core to boost higher without throttling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they usw different ram timings so maybe its that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well to be fair stock **gaming** power consumption actually isn't dramatically high, techpowerup found power consumption to be around 120w **when gaming**.",lowering to 88w will likely impact multi threaded application performance much more than gaming.,reviewers usually test power consumption in something crazy like prime95 small ffts.,"the 7950x actually consumes around 88w **when gaming** at stock, 7900x is like 81w, and so on.",it's just making that distinction between gaming power consumption and heavy application power consumption.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you are only gaming 13600k or 13700k (i will probably get the 13700k later).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, 12900k is still a monster",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
abso-fuckinglutely-not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,13900k has more cache for example.,you can look at 13900k 90w numbers and it pretty much matches 7950x at 90w.,13600k cannot match 13900k at 90w.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 13600k consumes almost double the power for the same kind of performance in an all-core load.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
different ram spec,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its not a flaw.,"as op said, theyre using the max jedec speeds",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ive been running ddr5 6400mt/s @1.42v, mclk=uclk, if=2133 (stock misc voltage) for about 2 weeks now.","interestingly 2167mhz if causes mclk for the above setup to run at 3250 however this was not stable (no idea if this was related to insufficient power to if , didnt bother testing.",focused on mem timings instead).,anything above mclk=uclk is fairly pointless to run for zen4 as of now and basically no mobo will boot high speed ddr5.,"excited for what really high speed ddr5 can bring on the intel boards - given everything else can keep up, should be fun!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i was very much downvoted for saying that steve is acting unprofessionally towards intel, but, oh well...the hivemind...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i argue that power limiting the chips isnt a very relevant test anyway.,"the vast majority of people that rely on these reviews are not fine tuning their parts constantly, they build the pc, turn it on and play.","most people have never seen a bios screen and dont care about power draw, they care about fps.",the only numbers really relevant to the bulk of gamers is fps.,"the dont care about power draw, gpus are hitting 600w, if people cared about power draw, these cards wouldnt be as well received as they are.","but for people rendering and pegging the chips are full use for long periods of time, the power draw matters a lot as it will influence cooling and operational costs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah de8buer video shows way diffrent results then hardware unboxed .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah because the 7950x doesnâ€™t thermal throttle and run at lower temps when maxed out.,"13900k is trash i. that regard and deserve to be called
out, you getting upset about that is your problem",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

13600k and 12600k require an entire new ecosystem.,"cpu, motherboard, possibly memory... would the 13600k win if paired with ddr4-3600?",might come out even.,"so if you're already on any ryzen platform, a 5800x3d costs **just the cpu** and has 96%+ of the performance of a 13600k (both prior to oc).","even if you're on an older platform, one has to consider which would be a better purchase - 13600k may cost a little more due to mobo, but could support your old ddr4 to save a bit.",yet that would leave you with a midrange build that will be difficult to sell 3 years down the line.,"almost guaranteed, 3 years from now 5800x3d will have increased in price since it is the last best cpu on its 4-year socket with lots of people looking to buy one, upgrading while saving a buck.",so for me the resale value pushes 5800x3d to the top even if their costs are same/similar.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"paired with expensive fast ddr5, sure.","5800x still best value when reusing ram and maybe mobo too, though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it depends where youâ€™re coming from.,"if youâ€™re running a 3000-series ryzen processor on a 500-series board, then the 5800x3d is probably the better buy as â€œbudgetâ€ upgrades go, since all you need to swap is the cpu, and your board isnâ€™t going to hold you back significantly.","if youâ€™re on pretty much any older intel platform, or a 300-series or older am4 board, 13th gen + ddr4 is likely the optimal budget upgrade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i assume that within 2 weeks there will be a price drop from amd to match the new market norms.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, lol.",5800x3d was a beta test for 7000x3d that are coming and will probably rekt both intel 13gen and ryzen 7000 in game performance especially where 3d versions are not reliant that much on ram latency which atm is a thing on ddr5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
agreed.,"i'm on a 5900x, and i still drool over the 5800x3d... thinking of getting the x3d and giving the 5900x to my wife who does more content creation, lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"agreed, but ""they're all the same"" won't have nearly as many views as ""the newest 3490kx blows away the competition!!!""",at least the faster cpu will last longer before needing replacement?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i understand now, so something like microsoft flight simulator can dray something close to 100w and my cooler can handle it(h100i capellix)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nah.,they didn't say greater than and all the other reviews i've seen show half the difference.,"also, when has intel ever sandbagged?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
talking about 13900k vs 7950x not the limited versions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah okay, i havenâ€™t watched any of the video reviews yet but iâ€™ve seen the thumbnails of 300+ watts but that must be synthetic/production workloads.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i bet you also read qvl lists, and believe mobo-manufacturers test all possible kits on market.","if not on list, does not work?",":d

alder lake, raptor lake, both work 6000++ on ddr5 or 4000mhz flat 16's settings on ddr4.","this is not magic, it's experience which you seem to lack on, yet you care to bend over for some specs.","well, some ppl put common sense aside and consider it all happened if written in bible lmao.","for example testing cpus on different ram settings, is like testing coolers inside a case.",too many factors and time to wait for better tests.,"&#x200b;

if the test is to show cpu generation differences, just use those library-machine tier ddr5 5200mhz on both, no need to artificially change to 4800.

so yes, thanks i can read intel's official specs.",woohoo.,ps.,"didn't call people retarded, but the irregularity in tests.",such nonsense reviews.,and youtube is full of clickbait stuff.,nowadays reddit seems to be infiltrated with ppl who do not understand what's relevant to test and what's not - i.e.,do not understand the consensus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice.,"though i've seen 6x 7950x's so far, and all of them failed to do 6400 even with a lot of voltage.",are you sure you're stable?,no wheas?,does it pass ycruncher/karhu/tm5?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i only skimmed it.,did he act badly?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no one asking to fine tune, but set the limits intel literally lists.","remember there used to be mce option enabled by default on some mobos - not sure if still a thing - but reviewers used to test with and without - because some said its ""not fair"" to amd because that's technically overclocking on the intel chip.",253w is literally the intel listed number which is close to amd limit.,"just like mce, mobo vendors unlock limits so that customers get as much perf as they can out of box when they install.",obviously amd boosting behavior is different and so this matters less there.,imho reviewers need to act like this is technically overclocking profile type thing.,"now, you may argue mce changes voltages also - which is fair to point out but the only reason we don't need to tweak voltages but only unlock power limits shows how far we have come in terms of chip design.","in fairness, intel stock profile must be considered as 253w.",.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i trust roman more (and he usually bins his cpu),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7950x hits thermal throttling almost instantly at stock settings even with top end aios.,hits 95âºc and stays there forever.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"
most reviews have the 5800x3d trading blows with 12900k for gaming - the key is to look at multiple gaming reviews and aggregate the results.",e.g.,https://www.anandtech.com/show/17337/the-amd-ryzen-7-5800x3d-review-96-mb-of-l3-3d-v-cache-designed-for-gamers/3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the ""dead socket"" argument makes literally no sense to me.","unless a socket is supported for 5+ years, they are all effectively dead sockets.","i mean am5 is only supported until 2025, so if you bought a cpu now, youd have to upgrade within 2 years to make use of the socket.",idk about you but i keep my cpus for at least 4+ years before its worth the money to upgrade,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yep, totally agree.",it is still the thing.,and it is definitely overclocking.,"that's why you see ""unlocked"" numbers in cb benchmarks listed above.",as those are the defaults on lot of gaming motherboards.,"asus historically was the most guilty regarding this, not sure whether others joined the crowd now, but asus is definitely still doing it.","they were doing tricks even back at pentium 2 days like having fsb at 103mhz instead of 100mhz to get to the top in mobo benchmarks, so they will probably never change :-)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"7950x is thermal throttling at 115â°c, not at 95â°c.","95â°c is thermal target where it stops increasing power/clock, not where it starts throttling.",i have never seen review showing it reaching the thermal throttling limit.,did you?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if you only game you're throwing away money buying a 13900k lmao,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at least on intel its not overclocking since its an officially supported configuration and does not void the warranty.,"compare to increasing the cpu or memory clock out of spec, which voids the warranty for overclocking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they just behave different, but they both have a temperature target where they start dropping wattage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if u wanna be technical about it.,wouldnt it have to drop below baseclock to be throttling?,cant really call it throttling if it doesnt sustain full boostclock if temps cant keep up imo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

but even then, this is not true:

>5800x3d is clearly the way to go until next gen, lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that doesn't mean amd doesn't have headaches because of it.,this is clear from amd omitting the previous gen 5800x3d from their charts for zen4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

are you trying to joke?,"so increasing the memory clock or cpu clock out of spec by the user is oc for you, but when the mobo manufacturer decides to ignore/increase the power limit out of spec, effectively increasing the cpu clocks, that's not oc for you?",lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sure, but zen4 are maintaining full boost clock at 95â°c unless they also hit power limit.",they are not lowering their clock when they reach 95â°c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nah if you throttle below the advertised clock speed (boost or not) then you're thermal throttling.,no one cares if you can hit 5.8ghz for 3 seconds before going down to 5.2 to avoid melting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"im looking to upgrade my cpu for a specific game (factorio)

im waiting for the 7800x3d or whatever their 7000 series 3d stacked chip will be.",i imagine it will be a monster with a year of refining their 3d cache tech and the good gains this generation has had over last.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think it varies heavily by the game being benchmarked.,"the anandtech review you sent showed the 12600k being faster than the 5800x3d in more games than not, and often by a large margin.",other reviews like ltt corroborate this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yes most people do not upgrade every year or even every 2 years but there are still people who do because they like new shiny stuff and i don't think i said anywhere that people who have 5800x3d will be buying 7000x3d, just people who want to buy a new gaming cpu will/should be waiting for 7000x3d instead of normal 7000x so idk why you are trying to explain this to me that people are not buying new cpus every gen",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well yea... very interesting design!,just a different boost algorithm in the end tho,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have u seen the 13600k 5.6ghz all core stable at around 1.3vcore... pretty good imo.,but yea doesnt zen4 boost higher n then stabilize at 95â°c so.. same same slightly different.,both very interesting imo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the 5800x3d is faster than the 12700k in their test

19 tests on the page, the 5800x3d is faster than the 12600k in 12 of them.",you'll notice the 12600k beats the 12900k in 8 of those tests.,"that's not because the 12600k is faster than the 12900k, but due to issues when tests start to become gpu bound

again, as mentioned, here's a meta roundup of almost all review results for the 5800x3d vs 12600k.","putting the 5800x3d at 100%, the 12600k scores 88.8% of it's performance.",the 12900k is 98.3% of its performance.,the 12900ks beats the 5800x3d.,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/u5ixa7/amd_ryzen_7_5800x3d_meta_review/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"instead of sensationalist forehead slapping thumbnails, hard data and professional testing, well done!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is the best review.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
90w 13900k + 280w 4090?,650w psu is back?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5.1ghz at 1.08v!!!,holy moly.,even if the e-cores and cache are way down that's still very impressive and those don't even seem to have that big of an effect.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
everybody else: flaming thumbnails.,professional: cool kitty.,awesome testing by the way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
der8aur has been *killing* it lately.,"his 4090 and 13th gen videos are absolutely on point, focusing on power draw and efficiency.",love it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks, watching it now.",it's weird that everyone already knew the power situation from the last gen but nobody else seemed to test behavior under reasonable power limits.,clickbait is probably the answer of course.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is a good review  no bs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seeing this and his 4090 video about power consumption really drills in how full throttle these companies are pushing their silicon.,i wish these companies would push a more consumer friendly way to tweak the power settings.,"like a power saver/balanced/performance toggle because the efficiency is there, it's just hidden behind bios tweaks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how does he measure actual powerdraw?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is that how you power limit your cpu?,just set those three values from bios?,never done that before.,and is there other ways to do that (like from windows)?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"unfortunately, testing methodology doesn't generate views.",it's rather a sad problem in the yt tech review scene,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"disappointing to see gn & hu go down the nonsense thumbnails route, but it is what it is.",i believe it's best to switch up your sources every couple of years.,"it happened to jay, it's happening to the aforementioned two.",der8auer certainly seems to be staying more honest and down to earth.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the others aren't lying.,and i still would like to know the hardwares behavior at full load.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"shocking how overclockers have the best methodologies 

wonder why",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if it's from a good brand and can handle well power transients, sure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
problem is gpu power limits are only enforced when you load in nvapi hooked by afterburner or other tool.,this essentially means if gpu decides to load 500w before afterburner is loaded for like 1 second you are potentially screwed.,with cpu it is better as power limits you can enforce in bios on booting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
he's an engineer and it shows,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
will he review the 13600k?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"meh itâ€™s mostly about stock performance, people usually buy the new shiny parts and just plug and play so most day one reviews are like that.",most people never dive deeper into these types of subjects except for tech enthusiasts like most people here are.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yah it seems like that might be the way of the future honestly if you don't care about bragging rights for cinebench scores.,"i already set a 150w limit on my 9900k, i saw no reason to let it run upwards of \~190-200w.",i haven't decided if i'll make the jump to 13th gen or wait it out for 14th gen.   but i bet i'll use a power limit on those as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you aren't buying a $700 cpu for efficiency, you are buying for performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cpu ang gpus comes basically overclocked by the manufacturer to run near max by tossing away efficiency.,it makes me miss the days where it wasnâ€™t the case.,or just have everything run at eco mode at default and let people who want an easy juice run full throttle i guess.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you really want a 13900k when you don't know how to use it?,a ferrarri is not suitable for any inexperienced driver.,get a 13600k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why/how would the gpu do 500w before afterburner is loaded as windows startup program?,"the most i can see it doing is random max clock spikes with max memory speed, which idk know how much power that would be wth 24gb of gdd6x, probably less than 150w, based on the fact that 3080 random short spikes with maxed memory and clock speed, are like ~100w.",let's throw some transient spike in mix as well so let's say 200-250w max,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"doesn't have to be mutually exclusive unless you're trying to win benchmarks, which not all people buying expensive parts care about.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"of course it's just my opinion, but i'm using it mostly for gaming where all 16 e cores do basically nothing but add heat.",i do some video decoding where i could take advantage of all the cores full blast.,in those 2 situations i could run the cpu with the e cores throttled and with the p cores capped at like 150w because i don't need 300fps in every game i play.,if there was a couple of easy toggles i'd probably run it capped most of the time so i'm not dumping as much heat in my room.,but since i'd like the headroom if i need it in the future i'd like to have a couple toggles outside of bios tweaking.,that's all i was saying.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why not make it go balls-to-the-wall when you want it and sip juice when the system doesn't need to go full hot magma?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not everybody is a unemployed gamer that can expend days tweaking their hardware and testing the stability of different under-clock settings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're example is ironic because 95 percent of people don't tune their own ferraris and for at least a decade all ferraris come with a switch on the steering wheel that auto tunes the engine and traction control for different levels of power.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

incredibly intelligent argument there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think they just uncapped all the power limits,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it could be a silicon lottery loser chip chip and a motherboard that is more zealous on voltage.,that would not be all too surprising as each chip will use different voltages.,and it's not unheard of for a board day one to have some voltage issues and when you consider they probably tested with early bios it's possible.,but it's not impossible they upped stock voltage but i'd think one of the other two may be more likely,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if you are close to a micro center (which i am very close to one in nj and they also charge 3% tax on all items instead of the 6 or 6.5 percent since they are in a urban enterprise zone), you can actually get the things you need for a build without waiting for it to be shipped.","they have a lot of stuff with great prices (and they price match) and i always buy my cpu's there, because they are cheaper than amazon or newegg.","plus, you can just order online and pick it up same day.",and have a great return policy if the item is defective.,and you always seem to wind up buying something more for your build.,the only time i had trouble getting stuff from there was during the pandemic and afterwards.,"you couldn't get a graphics card, because there were limited stock.","and they had something like a ""new egg raffle"" type deal and if you won, you could buy the card.","there was also limited stock of everything, so a lot of people held off on their builds, until the prices came down (the miners crash).","but bottom line is that micro center somehow makes its money, because they sell everything computer related, and it is well stocked.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i was shocked they did that price this morning.,i cancelled my backup newegg order after i had it at the checkout counter.,love microcenter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got screwed by the whole process.,they charged my card and it fail fraud check - when i ok'd the charge it didn't go through and instead of them letting me fix it they just cancelled my whole order.,now i can't even put in a pre-order for it.,i got my mobo back ordered and shipped - but now waiting in line at 2 other places waiting on a cpu.....yuck.,almost tempted to drive 3 hours to a microcenter.....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i reached out to newegg to see if they'd adjust their prices after intel announced their pricing.,they said nah.,"then i asked why it was so much higher than msrp and they told me ""because we can"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

they're basically offering more silicon for less money than in the past.,that's great for consumers but it's not great for intel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all they did was add 10 more e cores and upped the power.,not exactly cutting edge.,performance per watt is still dogshit compared to amd in productivity and gaming.,[https://www.techpowerup.com/review/intel-core-i9-13900k/22.html](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/intel-core-i9-13900k/22.html),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it was explained in the video.,"they not only run it once and call it a day because that's not how you render something, it doesn't last a few seconds and done, it can run for hours straight full blast, or more.","they run it many times, so that the aio has time to heat up and soak, to get the steady state result and the 13900k thermal throttles so their results are lower, but realistic if your use case is legit rendering.","as for the 330w figure, it's correct depending on the mobo and processor used as there are variations in the auto voltage settings depending on mobo and processor.","gamers nexus touched on that issue in their review, explaining it.","actually listen when you watch reviews folks, it would perhaps prevent dubious conspiracy theories like that and other accusations, you know which ones.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hub scored lower because their 360mm aio heat soaked at 260w on their 13900k, resulting in 5ghz p-cores at 1.26v vid which is probably 100mv higher than it should be for 5ghz

i updated my bios last night to latest available from asus.,"that said you will need to use a bios that supports 13th gen, but you can update without a cpu on most boards.","just make sure the board supports ""bios flashback"".",this allows an update with a usb stick and no cpu installed.,so no need for old cpu to update to latest for new cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

fyi they also fixed the latency issues when going from p cores to e cores and also switching between e cores.",of course they also increased the cache both for the p and e cores.,if you can allow your anger to dissipate a little bit you will see that it is actually a pretty robust improvement on alder lake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

> and how do they make more money if they have no profit?,"so, to clarify.",they do have profit.,most companies cannot survive long without profit.,what they are doing is what's called [loss leader](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lossleader.asp).,"in short, what it means is they sell a product or service at a loss in hope (or expectation) that you will spend money on something else that do net them a profit.",ever gone to the grocery store to pick up one thing and come out with a dusin?,another way of thinking about it is in customer acquisition.,"many companies will compute the cost of acquiring a new customer, and that cost is usually correlated with marketing costs.",so how much does it cost to get this customer and how much lifetime benefit (i.e.,profit) do the business get from the customer.,"typically, that cost is **not** negligible and represent an upfront outlay.","well, selling something at cost (or even lower profit), means that customer acquisition cost isn't as high.",word of mouth and so on.,"so this is somewhat of a capital intensive customer acquisition process, but not *really* in cash flow terms outlay costs.",meaning you didn't pay up front for the customer to retain them into the future.,think signup bonuses on credit cards or free phone with that mobile subscription.,"another thing this helps with is increase sales, which helps the business negotiate better prices due to their scale.",hopefully that helps clarify it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

which further reinforces my feelings on e cores as nothing more than a stopgap before  actually having the real progress we've been hoping to see continue on.,there's no scenario where a 8p + 8 or even 16e setup trumps a full 16p.,"it just doesn't work that way, if talking apples to apples.","we should have 12 and 16 performance core chips if intel put the r&d into advancing tech 7 years ago like they should have, but didn't because of being comfortable as number 1 and coasting along with no progress until ryzen showed up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i say wait for the 13400. the non-k chips and the low-mid tier chips from intel have been phenomenal from intel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

13600k*,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd still consider a 7600x in my specific case.,"you see, i'm running 3rd generation intel hardware, and if i'm upgrading at this point, it won't be for value into previous gen hardware.","my cpu is a bottleneck at this point and any upgrade path i choose requires me to get a new cpu, mobo, and ram no matter what.","the way i see it is like this; while intel holds the value game at this time, amd holds a longer-term value in my head.",how many upgrades will i get out of a freshly released am5 socket?,"sure the platform costs more, and it performs worse in some benchmarks to intel's 13600k, but it's all moot wins to me since the gpu and gen 5 storage (with improvements to direct storage) are what's really going to future proof my games for another decade to come.",i am not a generation to generation pc upgrader.,i upgrade when parts break or my games become frustratingly unplayable.,"so since i need almost new everything, i'm just saying ""fuck it if im losing out on hundreds of dollars in cost to performance savings.","i will go with future proofing.""","all that being said, i am open to having my mind changed if my logic is flawed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because amd opens up a much cheaper upgrade path going forwards.,"ddr5 will be around for the next 5 years minimum, pci-e5 is soo fast that you'll not see much benefit from 4 to 5.

but personally i'd wait for the amd 3d stacked memory chips coming in january on the current am5 platform, they will take the gaming crown again and on an am5 platform that is pretty futureproofed.","all i'll need to do to keep the pace of modern pcs is replace the cpu (and the graphics card, but that is the same for both platforms)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"more importantly, they seem to study basic economic theory, something that can't be said for nvidia or amd cpu department.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes!,"and cheaper platform cost, especially for ddr5 boards and memory.",also without e cores you still have an easier time with the windows 10 scheduler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no shit itâ€™s gonna be better.,if we are gonna go by your argument then we can also wait another 1-2 years for intel 14th gen and so on so forthâ€¦ theres just no end.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because of gpu is so expensive at that time ($900 for 3080 10gb)  so i got 12100f for $110 (while 12600k $3xx).,"and when 12600k drop below $200, i will pick up one then sell the 12100f (for like $60-70)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"problem with pdx games is they don't even use 4 cores at full load, and it's all about single-thread performance, so the 13600k is overkill in the sense you don't need most of its cores, though it's good at per-core performance

for pathfinder it's complete overkill",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think you are mistaken.,for the cost of am5 platform you can get two intel mobo+ddr4 ram upgrades.,plus you are giving away massive multi-core performance which if you go with intel will need not upgrade anytime soon until at least next 3-4 years by then am5 will also be going out.,so this idea of upgradability is mistaken unless am5 platform cost comes way down which imo may not happen anytime soon.,"so if you calculate total value you can get out of intel vs amd within next 3-4 years (just for ex, could could be next 5 or 6 years even base on how often you upgrade), intel seems to come out on top plus you'll be enjoying much better performance till your next upgrade.",please let go of this wrong idea of upgradability it is for those who do it every generation or two.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the response.,why did they say 13th gen requires windows 11?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think you missed the point in my first paragraph where i said i'm not upgrading for value into older gen hardware with the new platform out.,so let's say i do go intel anyways and i still want a ddr5 platform.,"not only are those mobos just as expensive as am5 mobos, but they also won't have a ""cpu only"" upgrade path in the next 5-8 years.","also giving away ""massive multi-core performance"" is a bit of an exaggeration.",i've seen several benchmark comparisons now and   know that it's not that steep of a performance loss.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i'm really excited to see how the non-k i5 skus do given that they're all supposedly going to have e-cores now, which would make them absolute kings in the budget segment if they're priced similarly as last generation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
german site pcgh did test a 13900k with pl1=pl2=88w.,on average in games still (barely) faster than 7950x (non-eco mode) and 4% faster than 7950x eco-mode with same ram speeds: https://www.pcgameshardware.de/raptor-lake-s-codename-278677/tests/intel-13900k-13700k-13600k-review-release-benchmark-1405415/6/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think they're all running in the (now for some reason) default extreme power mode?,"intel puts pl2 at 250w, so you'd expect about that much power draw at proper stock settings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's only power hungry with no limits in synthetic benches.,gaming and application usage is less power and more performance for intel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i bit on a 13700k.,i think it is the perfect compromise between perf and multi threaded capabilities.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you do realise it consumes 300w only when pushed to its limit i.e all core work load.,for games it runs around 110w,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if all you are doing is gaming (which lets be real, aside from a synthetic dick measuring contest run its all the majority of us do) it isnâ€™t uncoolable.",tpus power graphs show the 13900k at 117w avg across their gaming load and 70ish watts for the 13600ks.,the 7600x does 2c better than the 13600k but gets 1% and 5% worse performance in exchange.,"the narrative that they are uncoolable is stupid, and itâ€™s a shame so many reviewers have gone towards that angle considering the majority of nerds watching arenâ€™t throwing a blender workload at it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
people stuffing 900w systems into shoeboxes is the real culprit here.,you need volume for air flow to actually work to remove heat.,these systems are drawing nearly 3x the wattage compared to just 2 or 3 years ago.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
was anyone expecting it not to be hot?,similar to the 12900k?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most people that bought a 13900k could safely assume that it would be hot and power hungry based on how the 12900k performed though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have been following his channel for a while.,these days gn is both cocky and condescending.,derbauer is technically superior yet so humble.,the other upcoming youtuber daniel owen is pretty good as well.,"on a general note., the good old days of simply slotting the cpu and running a bunch of programs is pretty much useless in my opinion.",for the vast majority of people 13600k should be the go-to option.,13900k is a complex beast and getting the most out of it would require some kind of tweaking.,i wish semiconductor industry stops going for these chart-topping numbers and simply show generational progress at same power and price point.,it looks like intel's claims that 13900k matches 12900k under 100w is more or less true and that is damn impressive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you do realize if they did that the performance numbers would absolutely tank right?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
upgrade to zen4x3d you will not have a dead socket,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
noctua nhd15 is fine for the cpu... ltt used only that cooler for their 13900k and it was fine.,with unlimited power and maximum load it was hitting at 100â°c as that is the  temperature target for raptor lake just like 95â°c is the temperature target for zen4.,if you check some other review who used aio and unlimited power limit you'll see they're getting to 100â°c temp as well.,"if you don't like seeing 100â°c at max load then enforce 250w power limit in bios, the performance difference versus unlimited power will be very small.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dh15 is not enough and i would say 1200 w ps to help with those 800w spikes from 4090,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
keep your psu and cooler its enough,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"afaik intel doesn't require or even recommend one power config over the other, at least they haven't in the past.","so reviewers will judge default behaviour, which is what they should do.",if intel doesn't like that then they should enforce pl2 = 125w by default.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i don't understand either.,"and gn at one point always use to do its tests and final judgements with the intel limits, not the unlocked ones.",and would get mad at mobo makers who turned it on by default.,but i guess the clickbait thumbnails get them more views.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why would you recommend such an expensive cpu as the 5800x3d for gaming?,the only reason to buy a cpu as expensive as this is for productivity which the 5800x3d is not good for.,for gaming a much cheaper cpu like the 12400 is plenty for current and future games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i love how you attempt to make a dig and yet by doing so prove your no better.,nobody is whooping anyone's ass and the 13900k is not toping every chart.,the cpu's are in single digit % between each other at lower resolutions/high end gpu's and even closer at 1440p and 4k and thats great.,competition is good for everyone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

on sffpc zen4 is actually way better.,"just tune the tjmax in bios manually to the value that you feel comfortable (e.g., 80c) then you're good to go.",the processor will automatically manage itself not to go above that value.,"with even a low-profile cooler (<50mm height), 7950x could easily manage 120w at below 80c, all without undervolting (fully stock config supported by amd).",and the performance is just insanely good at that wattage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i also found a couple oddities:

i think the 13900k specifically deserves to be crapped on for it's insane power usage and thermal throttling.,"this is $1000+ setup, comparable to ryzen 7950x in performance and cost.",why spend $1000+ to deal with high temps and throttling when the competitor is more efficient and not throttling?,especially when they have a new platform with future upgrades and the intel platform is end of life.,seems like poor value.,but the other intel sku's might be great.,"the lower-tiered intel sku's might be the best value setups for gaming, as long as they don't have the same throttling issues.",amd's lower tiered stuff is a little expensive vs intel.,building a $450-500 intel 13th gen ddr4 gaming setup seems unbeatable in value.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it actually does look at the benchmarks lol.,"the 5800x3d wins in like 2 cache sensitive games, in everything else raptor lake is 10%+ faster",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they seriously suck as a supposed reputable tech-journalist.,blunder after blunder with these guys to the extent that they are either incompetent are being manipulative.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you missed something.,"their cb23 results are a 10 minute loop, it says so right at the top of the chart.",the rest are using a single run.,"the chip is thermal throttling under the loop test making the results much worse on the loop run, if you watched the video they went into this, they showed the single run result as well iirc.",every other review i looked at did not use the cb loop run.,both results are valid.,"for a large rendering workload, the 10 minute loop is a much more meaningful result.",but if you are more concerned about short multi-threading workloads then the single run is the more meaningful result.,"basically when it comes to multithreading, the 13900k is winning all the short benchmarks, and loosing under the longer bigger workload tests.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"their whole ddr5 debacle recently had nothing to do with intel looking bad, but it was still a terrible video from hub.",itâ€™s them spreading misinformation with a huge following like they do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wow, so they have to make the benchmarks again ?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"could be bad silicon lottery or a defective chip, or the ihs doesnt have enough contact with the die.",in fact i'd bet money that's what it is because there's no way intel would ship a product that throttles at stock settings.,*edit/* according to the hub twitter this behavior is caused by the msi board they reviewed the cpu on being way too aggressive with voltages,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
indeed.,1440p is the way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"well, it was supposed to have been resolved long ago on windows 10. this was primarily a zen 2 thing and people cared then.",remember the ccx disabling?,it's revisionist to say that we only started caring with e-core.,zen 2 brought a lot of new issues/considerations with the chiplets it introduced.,infinity fabric limitations etc etc.,"every new arch brings issues but in this case this is the return of an old issue thanks to .. well, microsoft.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
he said so in the video and it explains why the 7700x beats the 7950x beyond error.,cross ccx latencies are going to hurt performance.,the games should run on one ccx.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

they used to cost $50.,the problem is you can't omit a $150 powersupply and a $150 aio cooler from the platform cost if they have become essential items on a 300 watt cpu.,"that is not objective, it's misleading.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"but this isn't anything new - intel motherboards have been doing similar things since 8th gen (coffee lake) - mce, too much voltage at stock, unlimited tau, and now basically with unlimited power.","still, the difference with amd and intel is that the former always follows a platform-specific power limit defined by tdp\*1.35 = ppt.",so it's not really an apples to apples comparison if one platform follows the manufacturer spec and the other doesn't.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
those two are different things altogether.,"if xmp is overclocking, so is expo.",don't talk irrelevant stuff when the discussion is about cpu power limits.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not everyone lives in australia.,"in north america, specifically, canada i got my 6200 32gb ddr5 kit when it first came out for $574 cad.",that same kit on newegg today is $464.,"not a huge drop, imho.",it makes zero sense for you guys who usually prefer value over performance to think zen4 is the better option.,they have less options and everything is more expensive.,13900k is cheaper than 7950x option in every area.,"the cpu itself, the option of ddr4, the option of z690 which has many deals going on right now.","and next time, use intel guidelines for power, not the unlocked ones from mobo makers.","and you won't see such crazy power and thermals, for minimal  performance loss.",fyi: https://i.redd.it/2bifhqmovyu91.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

averages across multiple games prove you wrong.,"it's not just ""a few"" games that perform well with it, but a whole bunch of games, especially the most graphically intensive games that are often times more prone to use cache, which is exactly where you want huge bump in extra performance (30-60% more fps).","so many games perform incredible with the 5800x3d, that it's close to the next gen flagship ballpark of performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they get correct values at unlocked power limits, therefore that argument is invalid.",if they were about to be thermally limited is precisely in that test.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there's no way it's thermal throttling at 88w where their score is a full 30% lower than every other outlet.,"if it were thermal throttling, they would be wrong more at unlimited power instead of 10% and wrong less at the lower end of the power usage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you think the 13900k is thermal throttling at 65w?,think this through.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so the msi bios is bugged.. 

well then hub should make an extra video where they test it on another board which doesn't push excessive voltage into the cpu making it a hot mess",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

mce is entirely different and should not have been enabled by default.,"what we're looking at here isn't mce, it's stock behaviour, as claimed by intel.",intel want these cpus to run at the default clock multiplier table without power limits as it allows them to win benchmarks.,you're trying to create a scenario where intel can have their cake and eat it to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

huh?,"i never said that, that would be ridiculous.","hardware unboxed made the claim, that the 13900k thermal throttled in a 10 minute cinebench loop.",i reiterated their position.,there is no way that chip is only drawing 65 watts in an all core cinebench loop.,"the possibility of a thermal throttle in a 10 minute loop is certainly plausible, thus i believe their claim.","no other reviewer ive seen so far did a 10 minute loop, so i currently have no counter evidence to their claim.",do you have counter evidence that it did not throttle in a 10 minute loop for someone else?,if so i would like to see it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the context is a 2000â‚¬ gpu and 750â‚¬ cpu + 250â‚¬ ram and \~300-400â‚¬ mainboards.,and you guys are discussing about the handfull of $50 psu's that dont explode and are decent enough if you dont constantly overload them with extreme high transients.,isnt this a bit silly?,:),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
evga sells 600 watt bronze psu's for like $45 all the time.,thermaltake sells 700 watt power suppies for $50.,these were not designed to be pushed to the limit by 2022 hardware.,in 2020 they were totally acceptable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

holy power consumption lmao.,even the 13600k is sucking 7900x worth of power.,seems like the 13900k and 7950x pretty much trade blows in production.,one is better here the other there and so on.,rpl and zen 4 seem to be in single digit performance.,again rpl wins some zen 4 others etc and thats with a 1000$ gpu.,once you go lower or increase the ress to 1440p the difference is virtually identical.,seems like its gonna be a very competitive gen at least on the gaming side.,the 13600k is a banger though matching or exceeding the 7700x in production for 80$ less with comparable gaming performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's compatible, but you may need to update the bios to run 13th gen. luckily your board comes with q-flash plus so you can update the bios with a flash drive",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
youâ€™ll be fine.,pcpartpicker is saying all the z690s are not compatible.,i noticed it was flagging me for the asrock z690 itx i had in my build but i double checked the asrock site and downloaded the new bios for it.,youâ€™ll just have to flash the bios before you install the cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

for example, the product the op is talking about clearly has support based on bios updates:

and even though that press release suspiciously only has z690 boards in the table, this very-bottom-of-the-line h610 already has 13th gen support, so it's pretty safe to extrapolate that all of them do:

"> b460m 

> (h470 chipset)

elaborate?","that is a b460 board with a b460 chipset, unless you did some demented hackjob on it that broke half the board's functionality?","b460 and h470 should both have no overclocking, nor allow 3200mhz.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"might be because originally by design, 10th gen chips on b460 did not go past 2933.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the bios is probably made up to 3200 when 11th gen support was added.,but 11th gen actually seems to be 'supporting up to' 2933 gear 1 or 3200 gear 2 from their official documents.,so it may sound weird when h510/610 appears to be able to do 3200 gear 1 when you can't.,"but technically it may actually be more in line with intel's 'no *frequency* overclocks above the supported speed'


edit: [go to page 19-20 on this rocket lake document, and read the details of the ram speed.",it is supposed to only support 2933 gear 1.,](https://cdrdv2.intel.com/v1/dl/getcontent/634648),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
b560/z490/z590 are the only boards you'll get over 2933 mhz with gear 1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"mine has a v2 on it beside rev 1. i know, confusing but it is what it is.",also it is really an h470 as per reviews about the motherboard.,some other manufacturers also offer b460m with h470 chipset as some kind of a refresh to their b460 (hence the v2) to support 11th gen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its marketed as a b460m from gigabyte if you search it actually says h470 chipset inside.,"[https://www.gigabyte.com/motherboard/b460m-ds3h-v2-rev-10/sp#sp](https://www.gigabyte.com/motherboard/b460m-ds3h-v2-rev-10/sp#sp)  


also h470 does allow 3200mhz , i can set it and can use it but it is only stuck in gear 2 mode, hence im running it in 2933mhz gear 1 as it gives more fps in some of my games.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
chipset is h470 though.,and i can set 3200 on gear 2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i see.,so probably a different board wouldve allowed me to do so then.,thanks!,i thought i was missing something since i could select it but it wouldnt reflect on cpu-z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah figured.,i was just hoping i did something wrong since i do have the option to select it.,only that it wouldnt reflect on cpu-z only 3200 gear 2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
b460m ds3h (rev.,"1.0)  says b460, i assume h470 is a typo from gigabyte's nonexistent qc.","nothing else makes sense, like using a different chipset for a revision in violation of intel's rules *and* the chipset requirements.","..actually, that would be in line with gigabyte as well.",never mind.,"the v2 specs dont even list 3200 support, says max 2933 for i7s and up, only.","xmp max for i5s on that platform is 2666.

to be fair that is highly dependent on whoever sets up the gleam settings.,it's not an automatic encouragement of social media spamming unless the giveaway is set up to allow it.,this particular one only asks for following and visiting.,no retweets or sharing required for entries for example.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"look i get it, micro centre is in the us so any competition would be through their stores.",but really how complicated is it to ship a prize overseas?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s not about shipping itâ€™s about the laws regarding giveaways in some countries.,some content creators that do giveaways mention that as well.,and if itâ€™s through micro center that is another reason itâ€™s probably just easier to make it us only.,i agree it is dumb and sucks for those outside the us.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"itâ€™s unfortunate for people outside the us, but itâ€™s not just the shipping costs from a financial standpoint: thereâ€™s also import fees to consider, which can vary depending on the country and the value of the prize.",different countries also have different regulations about the legality of giveaways and the legality of the various terms and conditions required to enter the giveaway.,"intel probably decided that the logistics and costs required to create different terms and conditions for different countries was too much to be worth it, and theyâ€™re not alone: most competitions iâ€™ve seen on gleam are restricted to one country, or one jurisdiction like the eu.","once in a blue moon, iâ€™ll stumble onto a giveaway that will ship to the us *and* canada or something.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes.,i know from gamedev that streamers/reviewers like a review embargo because it ensures their content is on an equal playing field upon release.,"without a review embargo, one of the reviews will already be at the top (of seo / youtube algorithm / etc), which is usually just the reviewer with biggest audience already.",at which point it becomes almost impossible for new review to gain traction.,"kinda like how in a given reddit post, one comment thread tends to dominate, even if it's off-topic meme garbage.","in short, embargoes tend to help out the little guys of media.",edit: but that doesn't have anything to do with having the embargo be on the sales day.,so... not exactly an answer to your question.,could be related though - maybe making sure purchase / affiliate links go through the reviewers or something.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

gpus were a different story for intel, they gave reviewers free reign to do whatever they wanted before the release, and this allowed them to iron out a majority of the bugs and generated buzz for the product (although negative press to begin with)

there are honestly pros and cons to doing both, and no one is obligated to buy a product on launch day",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

z790 just have more features and higher vrms.,vrms on the z690 are already overkill so not needed.,most of the features are ones people won't use.,so they cost more for basically the same product in terms of real usage.,the boards should have the same performance.,waiting to see how that turns out tomorrow.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"or it could be they want your youtube feed, reddit home page, and social circles sharing content on the products you're selling the same day they come out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the l2 cache is just a standard l2 cache in the cache hierarchy that goes from smallest to largest in size and fastest to slowest from l1 to l2 to l3.,smart cache is intelâ€™s name for l3 cache that is shared between the cpu cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"> and the answer usually is because the product is poop, but iâ€™m not sure in this case since all indications point to a very competitive release.",no.,they do reviews early to sabotage another company's launch.,it's a common industry practice.,but the norm is to release on the day that the product is available for sale.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if the product is going to propel them to the top of the market the reviews come early to get as many people pre ordering and â€œwaitingâ€ for the release instead of buying competition versions

if the product is not going to put them on top they wait until launch day so as not to get cancelled pre orders and keeps people from instantly buying the competition before they release

maybe for a server farm, or for laptops on battery, but what matters to an average pc user is how fast a typical application is processed.","that measurement includes ""overall throughput per watt of electricity"" in an indirect way, since an inefficient processor is going to produce extra heat and may run into thermal throttling issues - slowing down processing (**which is, again, what actually matters.","** there are few people fretting over a ""performance per watt"" meter on their cpu, whereas everyone just wants their applications to run faster.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
applications run faster in a very meaningful way by increasing throughput per watt.,"there is a reason why consumers have been buying cpus with more cores, what ultimately matters is the throughput and not single core performance.","if you truly believe in single core performance being all that matters, then i expect you to never purchase a device with multiple cores in it for the rest of your life.",enjoy your sad existence if you choose that path.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i don't know i find that retailer's message dubious.,"maybe my country has just left a bad taste in my mouth, but i feel like it's the retailers.","up until about 5 years ago, everything was cheaper to buy abroad.","for example, say i wanted to buy some hdd for 100â‚¬ from amazon uk.","adding vat, shipping, conversion rates, can't remember if i paid both your and our taxes, even with all that, the price would only be about 150â‚¬ to 180â‚¬.",which was still significantly cheaper.,i think local retailers would charge around 300â‚¬ for the same product.,"subtract all the vat you want, it isn't anywhere near 100â‚¬...

then from 5 years up until the so called shortages, the prices were the same, so i would buy locally, of course.","but once those shortages hit, oh boy...well the strange thing is after the shortages 'ended' and every article online talks about how the prices of gpus are going down.",they actually went up here...i built a computer this year and  the prices had already started jumping up when i put it together.,"now, i looked up the motherboard and cpu and their price is 1.5 to 2x what they were when i bought them...

coincidentally, does anyone know if a rx 550 is worth the 350â‚¬ (without vat) that i've seen at retailers?",i am not surprised the a770 is listed at around 470â‚¬ (without vat) here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

349 usd - 400 gbp for the 16gb model that makes sense at the conversion rate.,"oh wait........

arc isnâ€™t a value proposition anywhere in the world.,amdâ€™s offerings destroy it in price/performance.,even the 4090 is better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's a huge die, they wanted good pr so set a competitive rrp and got a few people to want it then pushed up pricing.",it's also likely that at the die size for the performance it's simply losing money at a lower price.,raising prices kills demand but that's a good thing when your product isn't competitive and you need to sell at a loss to get a decent number of sales.,"arc is incredibly uncompetitive in performance for the die size, it's way more expensive to make on 6nm with such a large die size and that's where arc is a problem.","if it was half the size it would make a very nice profit with the same performance at the 6600xt/3060 price point, at it's actual die size it's a major issue.","they need to get to the next gen, gain massively in efficiency and not waste billions subsidising the current gen card sales by making millions and selling them at a loss.","they would do this in the past with atom to get sales in phones but that wasn't during a recession, they had no competition from amd at the time and their profits were huge so could take that hit.",right now their profits can't afford to piss money away to get huge sales.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not outside of na.,cpu prices truly is shite.,the i5 13600k costs more than what 12700k was on release.,that's a massive yikes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7950x is ahead in blender.,but yes in the midrange intel does take the cake in terms of multithreading.,and yeah the 5800x3d was too good xd,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they likely will have an answer to v-cache when they move over to chiplets like amd.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3d v cache limits performance in other areas.,for one the 5800x 3d is limited to just 8 cores 16t with no headroom for overclocking.,"if you need the cores, 13900k or even 13700k provide 32t and 32t and 24t respectively.","in gaming 5800x 3d is excellent and wins some and loses some versus 13900k, i don't know yet on 13700k.",but 13th gen i7 and i9 can overclock and have multi task advantages over the 5800x 3d.,because the v cache adds more heat to the package so the cpu is limited by the cache but it gains an ipc advantage as its cache is closer to the cpu.,tradeoffs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the left side is most probably gpu bottleneck.,wait for tests with a 4090.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

13900k at 80w gives you same perf as 12900k at unlocked power.,same was true with 12900k at 65w vs 11900k at unlimited power.,"so efficiency will be improved by quite a lot, power consumption, not really, if you disable power limits.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

'slaughter' - no one is slaughtering anyone here.,"if the 13900k beats current zen 4 by 11%, and if we assume a 15% uplift from x3d, then a 7800x3d will probably be +4% over the 13900k.","then the 13900ks will release and the 13900ks and 7800x3d will probably be in a statistical tie, with the 7800x3d winning in those cache heavy scenarios - but the am4 platform is going to cost you 25%+ or more to build.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
considering that much of the performance increase comes from increased clockspeed and zen 4 being very hard to cool as it is.. i'm going to say zen43d might surpass 13th gen slightly in gaming but as they probably have to lower frequency alot it will be slower than 7700x in everything else.,"also

3dcache may not be as beneficial when you have ddr5 but we will see.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intel will respond back with another tec and 13900ks.,400 watts against a -30 pbo2 100 watt 8 core.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
amd literally did the same thing.,everyone does because people care more about that than other performance ratings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well the 13700k will literally outperform the 12900k.,its the same thing with higher clock speeds and more cache.,by how much is debatable but its impossible that it doesn't outperform.,"also with gaming performance there's little difference between x600, x700, x900 anyway",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it doesn't matter for gaming, my 12900k overclocked to 5.2ghz uses 77w max at 4k/120, average is more like 60w",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its definitely tomorrow.,"i already bought one anyway since i'm definitely not buying a ryzen because of reasons, it should arrive maybe \~4-5 hours earlier than 9am est.",the sad part is my ddr5 is definitely not gonna arrive by tomorrow because the sorting center sent it out to different state.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
today or tomorrow?,:),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
somehow the 5800x3d will come out as a winner in the fight between zen 4 and raptor lake.,there are some hidden cost savings with the 5800x3d some might not realize.,"because it is crazy efficient and uses very little power, you don't need a very good motherboard, nor do you need a good cpu cooler to get the most out of that cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

how did they hide it by putting it on the graph in bright blue?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 3d will crush everything in certain cache heavy games like factorio but on average it's slightly behind zen 4. if these slides are to be believed raptor lake will be healthily ahead of both.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

definitely.,"v-cache is no silver bullet, especially in it's current configuration but as the tech matures some of these limitations will be lifted.",the upcoming v-cache lineup allegedly including a 7950x is more than likely going to eliminate the mt drop you get by using the x3d skus.,it's hard to imagine that the upcoming v-cache skus won't be topping the charts for things that are sensitive to memory latency and it's testament to how good of an idea it is that both amd and intel are trying to avoid comparisons with it out of fear of making their products look bad.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

seems like they're back on track with tick ticking it.,but the big plus are the additional e-cores in general.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how did they improve efficiency so much?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ddr5 doesn't improve things much because if offers more bandwidth, not a reduction in latency.","cache improves latency more than bandwidth, cache will be exactly as beneficial on zen 4 as zen 3. gpus want bandwidth, cpus want latency, more bandwidth for an apu will help a lot (not a tiny 2cu igpu but a half a proper one).","the bigger benefits from ddr5 are more like scaling, power efficiency of signalling and control so the memory controller gets more efficient.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

where it matters for most professionals-things like adobe photoshop and premiere for example itâ€™s %5 at best with these scores.,iâ€™m not really concerned with 32 more fps in 1080p gaming.,the marginal percentage of improvement in st and mt workloads is due to the marginal improvements in clock speed comparatively between the 13700k and a 12900k.,whatâ€™s most intriguing by this launch is the minimal impacts to a 13900k when itâ€™s tdp is completely limited at 90w or below.,thatâ€™s exciting.,the question is where does the 13700k fall on power efficiency?,because if itâ€™s %5-10 improvements outside of gaming but is drawing well over 210w (what the 12900k averages in high load) then those improvements lose merit.,especially when i would expect the 12900k to be under $400 in a month or 2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"he has no idea what l2 cache is, lol.",he thinks its ddr4 memory or 10mhz higher.,the extra l2 cache on 13th gen is what will push the 4090 where zen 4 can dream of because 4090 also uses l2 cache on the gpu.,zen 4 on the other side uses more l3 cache which works great with amd gpu due to its massive l3 cache.,but l3 cache compared to l2 cache is 70% slower.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you're correct about minimums and the influence of the cpu there.,this is massively overlooked by all these pc build experts that recommend shitty cpu's to be able 'to spend more on the gpu'.,"it's slightly less bad nowadays as budget cpu's aren't as shit as they used to be, but it's still iffy advice.","i actually think that once you hit acceptable frame averages, the excess money should go to the cpu and ram.",it's no use going from 100 to 144 fps if you maintain shit lows.,stutter is far more detrimental to the experience than anything else.,"so if a cpu upgrade gets you from 100 to 110 fps average but with much better lows, it's the better choice in my book.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> marginal performance improvements

yeah nobody with a 12th gen should be buying this.",but if you're coming from an older chip there's no reason to buy 12th anymore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what i care more is about pricing.,"cpu these days are already powerful, no matter the producer.",the problem is that these graphs battle is getting annoying.,developers don't even get to optimize their games that a new cpu generation is released.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is highly annoying is that i can't read a damn review on this newer gen until it goes on sale tomorrow......people want to read and watch reviews before the product goes on sale....it helps with decision making!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm just so happy to be moving on from my 8700k.,at 4k it's been killing my 4090 performance.,13900k will be in my system for a loooong time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i picked up a 7700x with the free ram from microcenter but i am glad there is real competition in the space.,the 13600k is going to be disgustingly good value when it inevitably drops to like $250 in a few months.,i only chose ryzen because of the absolutely naughty chip that is going to be the 7800x3d.,"intel doesn't have an answer to 3d cache yet, unfortunately.",but they will be so much cheaper it's silly not to go that route.,"&#x200b;

in a few months you will be able to go 14 core 20 thread 13600k for $250, b660 for $80, and 32gb ddr4 3200cl16 for \~$85.","&#x200b;

thats a cool $415.",only $15 more than my 7700x.,right now is actually a kind of trash time to build.,"&#x200b;

ces 2023 will be great with all the zen 4 /raptor price drops.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"here i am just wanting to see an i9-13900k vs i9-9900k comparison because that's what i'm upgrading from but this is interesting as well

"when it comes down to it, mobo prices will matter.","because right now even a ""budget"" mobo for the am5 series, the cheapest is $250cad.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so... i'm guessing amd is just going to throw the 7950x3d and 7900x3d at it?,"if so, that kind of sucks for early adopters of the am5 chips...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's a bit misleading, if it's gaming they're comparing, they should compare it instead with the faster 7700x.",win 11 has scheduler issues with the 7950x that greatly gimps its performance and that ms has yet to fix.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wasnâ€™t there a leak on a hardware subreddit (not sure if its from here) reporting the same performance difference as this leak but is consuming 100w more?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can anyone think of a legitimate non-scummy reason that manufacturers set review embargoes on sales day?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what about productivity such as premier pro and handbrake?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which is great for the game but doesnâ€™t mean much for most gamers who will be bottlenecked by their gpu 99% of the tine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so did they use a 3080 in the intel system and a 3060 in the amd system again?,they've been caught blatantly lying in their presentations before.,"not sure why they feel the need to tell the tech journalists how it will perform, let them test it themselves.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you can afford this chip then there's extremely high chance you aren't gaming at 1080p which means your cpu doesn't really matter.,my 10900k vs my 12900k at 4k has 0 difference in fps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what are these games?,cherry picked!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because too tier cpus are not exactly gaming cpus .,i mean sure they run games amazingly but those are not really gaming cpus .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you will be enthused to know that the 7950x is more expensive and worse in almost every way,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the issue is the adoption rate of the ps5/ xbox series x is horrifically slow.,developers are still making games for the xbox one/ps4 in which a modern ipad has more gpu power.,it's gross.,those consoles need to die.,"until we get games only for the new consoles/pc, this will be an issue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unreal engine 5 is actually going to help a lot of us (developer here).,cpus and gpus are reaching some ceilings.,now is the time for game engines to really shine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and to me that doesn't instill trust in their performance claims.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
agreed.,honestly i'm holding off for the 3d chips for the 7000 series.,they should clean house on the 13th gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the xx600k skus have always been the go to chip for gaming/performance/overall value.,since like sandy bridge days of 2600k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"according to how margins are going for intel, price cuts arenâ€™t going to be that drastic.",i hope iâ€™m wrong.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"see how the 12900k runs in games, then add 10-15% on top of that",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nope!,"intel only reports their data with their cpus at bone stock, which is why intel cpus always perform better than intel portrays because motherboards pump as much voltage as the cpu can take

what are you playing?,"i play sims in vr (like msfs 2020) and the developer mode graphs clearly show my cpu is holding back the gpu

so cpu does matter",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"your gpu might be too weak to exploit a cpu bottleneck at 4k, but the 4090 can, and the 4090ti definitely will.",people buying flagship chips are also likely buying flagship cards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> if you can afford this chip then there's extremely high chance you aren't gaming at 1080p which means your cpu doesn't really matter.,my 10900k vs my 12900k at 4k has 0 difference in fps.,i guess you haven't seen the 4090 reviews showing hard cpu bottlenecks at 4k in most titles?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"dont know why people keep spreading this nonsense because resolution has literally nothing to do with cpu leverage, your cpu does not render pixels.",the reason reviewers will show lower cpu scaling in higher resolutions is due to the fps dropping (i.e.,going from 1080p to 1440p the fps drops from 100 to 75 or smth like that).,"cpus care about fps, not resolution.",if you wanted to play in 4k with 144 fps that would require exactly the same amount of cpu leverage as playing at 144 fps in 1080p.,this is also the reason why the rtx 4090 is bottlenecked by even ryzen 5800x3d in 4k - because the gpu can push 144+ fps even when the reviewers are maxing out graphics settings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this may sound like a stupid question, but why arent they ""gaming"" cpus when they have 8 performance cores that clock higher than the considered ""gaming"" i7 cpu.",also the i9 has more cache which games like.,so wouldnt that be better?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm not referring to all the cpu's, but at least starting from alder lake (starting from i5), zen 3 (starting from ryzen 5), in general, they are good cpu's no matter which one you buy.",i understand the competition but it's getting exhausting.,"new cpu launches, new motherboard launches.",just relax a little.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cpu hardware has not been the bottleneck for a very long time.,its software that need to be re-engineered.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as a ryzen user, i can say that zen 4 launch is a complete failure.","cpu prices are insane, motherboard prices are insane.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we need new consoles every 5 years and not 7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
exactly!,hard to commit money on a pre order when you have no clue how it's going to perform!,"buying blind is unwise.....especially if buying from newegg and they are not offering a 30 day return policy, only a replacement option which is absolutely insane!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think my next build will be intel 14th gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably much better 1%/0.1% too so  its not just a flat 10-15% more fps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, sorry am5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cheap last gen board and ddr4 makes it a compelling purchase over amd.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"regardless of who downvoted you (it wasn't me btw), i think it's important to always remember that all first party benchmarks are super sus, and this goes all ways from all vendors at all times.","in just a few days we will have real world benchmarks from all kinds of places, and we'll know what's up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i guess you were wrong bud.,a whole 100w higher that matches or slightly beats the 7950x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i hope so.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for those downvoting i make a living video editing with my pc currently using an amd r9 3900x and looking to upgrade likely to a 13700k, but waiting on results...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

people play in vr?,i'm sure that would but 99% of people aren't.,"battlefield, division 2, star citizen, cod, and a few others.",the difference of 2-3 fps wasn't noticeable after i upgraded.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most titles?,you mean aaa titles?,i guess tough haven't seen the 4090 reviews showing the is no bottleneck in most games.,at 4k....only the few aaa titles.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well.,beause they are not designed in way games would benefit the most.,"they are designed for heavy workloads and yes games benefit greatly from it, but other complex task that will likely benefit much more.","notice that performance difference igames between i5,i7,i9 is not that big.",games on i9 is tip of an iceberg of what this cpu can do.,nice example of a gaming cpu is 5800x3d.,it's cpu with very high cache which is exactly what games benefit greatly from.,"and boy it performs really really well in games , but is not as great in professional use.",also statistics wise there is not many gamers who buy those high end cpus because it's just not really worth it unless you absolutely need to have jest of the best fps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because the difference between a 12900k and 12700k is single digit % numbers.,especially if gaming at higher than 1080p and even more so if you don't have high end gpu to match.,if your buying a cpu for gaming its often a waste of money spending 200$ more on an i9 part.,same for amd with r7 vs r9 parts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the cpu is not that important in games, because in most situations you will have a gpu bottleneck, so there won't be much difference beetween an i9 and an i7 or even an i5.",the i9 does perform slightly better in games for the reasons you stated (higher clocks and more cache) but it doesn't justify the higher price.,it makes more sense to buy it for other tasks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"people are naive to believe that amd is not like the boogeyman they portray intel to be

yup,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this, so much this",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"everything i said was factually correct though

intel does keep their first party benchmarks to bone stock though that is a fact

motherboard manufacturers pump tons of voltages and basically oc the chips for you to squeeze out any last performance

whether or not intel stretched the truth comes down to how the benchmark was done, not the parameters of how the cpu is ran

intel has *always* used stock parameters to test their productd, and i would bet money on that",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the difference between 3080 and 3080ti are single digit numbers as well.,there are enthusiast gamers who pay hundreds of dollars for single digit improvements.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you sure about that?,"i am staring at the 13700k on newegg and it says this ""this item is covered by newegg.com's replacement only return policy""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">""there are enthusiast gamers who pay hundreds of dollars for single digit improvements.""",and i'l reserve judgement to call those people stupid.,the 3080ti was one of the worst products ever released even at its 1200$ msrp let alone for the inflated price it ended up selling at.,anyone who wasted money on it over the regular 3080 has very little common sense.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"tbh the fact that the ti was cheaper then the 3090/3090 ti and within ten percent i think means it actually -was- as good as, at msrp, deals got.","less good in the pre-owned market, particularly these days.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

my a770 le from pccg is literally on the delivery truck right now.,seems like its getting restocked in small waves.,update: mine was packaged in a malaysian airmail box.,you don't usually use airmail for stuff arriving in bulk.,i gather intel wantel to get these cards here quicker than usual at the cost of total volume.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"delayed, not paper, but yeah it seems like it, don't know anyone who has one yet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
slow roll out maybe.,intel should be cautious and it gave them some time to fix some issues.,they have been releasing drivers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"define paper launch

they are selling out completely in the us, where intel is based.","i can only imagine outside of the us

it will become more in stock as time goes on, but demand is very high",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i ordered mine from centrecom with eta of 18/10/22 but that has changed to 29/10/22 now 27/10/22.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"update: picked mine up yesterday, malaysian airlines box too.",guess it must be really small counts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think what you're missing is that the cpus don't actually run at the base clock, it is just a spec for a minimum level of performance you'd get if you had a cooler that could only handle 125w without throttling.","the parts with fewer cores would maintain a higher ""base"" frequency under those conditions.",doesn't say anything about how much power each cpu will actually consume.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™ll just link to a post i made about this subject a short while ago:

https://www.reddit.com/r/intel/comments/wwizyx/intel_i712700f_working_at_2_ghz/ilnskb4/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
base clock is pretty meaningless afaik.,they don't really tell you anything about power consumption as the idle clocks are much lower.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks, makes sense.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks!,i also upvoted the post on the link.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, they should express things differently... like maybe spec an idle average power consumption and perhaps some ""average casual computing"" usage power consumption.",actually specifying a clock other than the max (turbo) clock is confusing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"average idle power is on the order of a watt or two for all modern processors, so not too useful to spec that.","average usage will also vary by a factor of several depending on what the user does with it, so again not too useful.",to get an idea of actual power consumption you need to test under your specific workload.,the tdp specs are more about understanding clockspeed under sustained load with the shitty intel stock coolers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wonder if this will be like the 5950x launch.,"it released around the same time in 2020, and b&h opened for pre-orders the night before they were supposed to.","they were surprised by the ""tremendous"" demand for the 5950x, and ended up telling some people their order wouldn't ship until 2021. i was supposed to get mine by december 21st, then they said at the beginning of december that they wouldn't have my order until 2021, and then it shipped on december 29th.","i wonder if they'll be ""surprised"" again this time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this post is grossly incorrect.,b&h **does not** disable the ability to purchase even if they've run out of stock unlike other sites.,that is why it appears they still have stock.,if you order now you're not going to get it any faster than any other site that waits to reenable purchasing once they have stock in rotation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for $499?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i really want it but it seems so silly to upgrade from 12900k lol.,gah especially with the teased 13900ks on the way.,also how the heck is it not sold out at b&h already.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are they expected to be in short supply on launch?,or are you just posting for people that want to get them asap?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'm just now realizing this and pretty pissed off about it.,i'm going to wait and see what happens on the 20th.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"haha i hear ya, i'm upgrading from an 8700k and it's choking out my 4090 at 4k pretty bad.",have all my parts just waiting on the cpu.,b&h has been closed since the 10th i think because of the sukkot holiday.,"they just reopened the website tonight, i think that's why there are some available.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
donâ€™t fret.,new third party benchmarks are saying the increase from 12900k to 13900k is only like 2-4%.,https://youtu.be/_4dz7557pje,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is kind of shitty given that i got my 12700k from microcenter for $350 right around 12th gen release time.,is the 13700k really worth $90 more?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is what they sold the 12900k at.,best buy released at $50 cheaper but was out of stock the first month so i couldnâ€™t get the price match.,i got a mobo â€œdiscountâ€ and a gen 4 nvme â€œdiscountâ€ though soâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

microcenter has gotten quite expensive this last year from my experience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't know i think i9 for $650 is about right.,that thing can likely do 6.0ghz if you get a good sp 110 out of the box.,plus it has got 32 threads.,that is a lot of doing for a cpu.,if you were to have told younger me from 2004 that we would get cpus with 32 threads that can blast upto 6.0ghz getting triple digit fps numbers and is only $650 dollars???!?!?!,($413 dollars in 2004 money.),i would have told you to get outta town.,don't lie to me.,an [intel pentium 4 extreme edition](https://www.cpu-world.com/cpus/pentium_4/intel-pentium%204%20extreme%20edition%203.46%20ghz%20-%20jm80532ph0992m%20(b80532ph0992ms).html) 1c/2t was able to do 3.45ghz back then and it cost $999 in 2004 money.,that is $1569 dollars in today's cash !,!!,!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

gotta spend more money on the cpu heatsink if you donâ€™t already have one.,typically lower tier cpus would include a decent stock cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fake prices to make you feel like it's a good deal.,"there's no way they can have ""before"" prices when the cpus didn't even release for sale yet",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no bueno.,but even at that price.,it'll sell 'well' compared to am5 unless amd does some price cuts before intel official release.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and?,that's tray pricing.,it says so in your copy and paste.,tray pricing is the individual oem processor price for a bulk tray order of 1000 chips.,boxed retail is what normals like you and me pay.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
atleast there is 8 ecores this time.,11th gen gave you nothing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13900k is likely a higher binned chip though so should be capable of more clock speed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
$589 is tray pricing per unit for oems bulk orders in 1000 like hp or dell.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if /u/prchord is talking about the ark page data then those are tray pricing meant for oem in bulk orders of 1000 oem processors.,https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000029613/processors.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

manufacturer suggested retail price.,so [right here on intelâ€™s own page ](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/230493/intel-core-i513600k-processor-24m-cache-up-to-5-10-ghz/specifications.html) they list $319-$329 for the 13600k.,now what do *you* think msrp means?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hey i guess if you donâ€™t cross shop it looks great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s definitely not what stores buy them at lol.,"the bulk pricing for retailers is kept secret because intel probably sells at different pricing to different retailers - you and i wouldnâ€™t know it

all their open box stuff is what makes it so nice plus the price matching the do is fucking awesome.,idk what they list as the price cause iâ€™ll just price match to the cheapest option online and then cash in on their mobo cpu deal for that discount and get that sweet open box deal on a mobo to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah man.,crazy how expensive the 12900k was when it released and comparing it to the new series.,good thing they are on the same platform if you're able to sell the 12th gen and buy a 13th gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it was $350 the week leading up to thanksgiving (2 weeks after launch) then it was dropped again to $300 a week later.,i think i lost money on gas traveling back and forth to mc to get my price adjustment.,they wouldn't credit me online/over-phone because i wasn't using their mc credit card.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's also a tactic that is illegal in most of the western world.,luckily for microcenter they only operate in the usa.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
retailers buy bulk anyways.,1000 processors can easily be bought to warehouses or storage closets of micro centers many stores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

boxed retail yes.,no tray pricing.,tray pricing is bare processors in plastic trays delivered to oems.,i'm not 100% sure but if you buy an oem processor from like newegg it has no warranty.,prior to 12th gen oems got a 1 year warranty for each processor from intel but beginning with 12th gen it got extended to 3 years.,this warranty only exists for the oem.,"the pricing for 1000 boxed retail units is $599.99 a unit per https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/230496/intel-core-i913900k-processor-36m-cache-up-to-5-80-ghz/ordering.html


online or brick mortar shops still need to make money off of these.","whether they get a discount for ordering 10,000 units or not is not something the general public will know.","if you want my advice or not, don't order from newegg or amazon.",try to find another place that sells it for cheaper and doesn't apply tax.,"if newegg has 100k 13900ks on hand, as an example, they likely got a really sweet bulk deal behind the scenes.",for all we know they  might be making 90-120 net profit per 13900k sold.,just an example.,buying the first month makes no sense because these prices will come down and so will amd's pricing when they realize they were idiots to price so sky high with an expensive entry with the am5 motherboards not to mention ddr5 that places like microcenter need to hand out to make their am5 stock move.,consumers will win with enough patience.,neither of these companies are gonna maintain their sky high prices if people don't bite and buy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sorry yeah i didn't see your new reply.,most of the time overall cpu usage doesn't tell the whole story.,i can see when my cpu is bottlenecking when the frame rate is unlocked and the gpu is only at 60-80% usage that means it's the cpu.,"cpu usage can show only 40% usage overall but it's still the bottleneck because there's a few cores that are maxed out, i have rivatuner showing all core activity.","i think [beamng.drive](https://beamng.drive) is quite poor in optimizations sometimes, it's crazy that a 5.0ghz recently modern intel core will hit 100% usage pretty easily in this game.",i turn off real time reflections because of my older graphics card and it seems to even hit the cpu as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they most probably stopped making 12th gen already.,it's up to retailers at this point.,"the 12600k smokes 9900k, but 9900k is currently more expensive.",sometimes the prices of old cpu don't make any sense.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good point.,12th and 11th gen weren't all that impressive.,"yes there have been gains, but nothing worth paying this kinda money for.",12900k is great for what it is regardless.,it'll hold up for a while.,just tame the beast.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they donâ€™t need people to buy it now.,theyâ€™ll phase it out just like they do with every old cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
