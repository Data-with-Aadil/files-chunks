iâ€™m not debating price.,iâ€™m debating your argument that you need a high end motherboard in order to run the 5800x3d optimally.,iâ€™m not telling anyone to go buy a b350 motherboard but if someone has one already and wants to upgrade then itâ€™s possible to run that chip.,the video i sent shows there is virtually no difference in performance with their testing.,again not all boards are made the same so iâ€™m sure the bottom of the barrel (bad vrm) boards might not be a great fit.,if someone is new to am4 then absolutely go get the newest board if prices are decent.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"again, have a look at how the 5800x3d works and where the performance improvement in games mainly come from.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

haven't oc new cpu for a while.,i find that xtu is a pretty good starting point (after enable xmp in bios).,it has quick bench to test a setting which is giving a rough idea for what the cpu could do.,*the ratio i post would crash if i run prime95.,more fine tune is needed in bios i'm sure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have never used xtu until now.,i have always been one of those diehard use bios type.,"but with the asus bug on the z690 platform i just got so fed up testing out settings, see if it legit, crashes only having to wait like ages for it to boot over and over again.",xtu saves me this hassle.,once i am satisfied all the settings are stable then i will boot into bios and set them accordingly.,i never use to but got to admit i like testing settings on the fly as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"xtu is great, but i have no use of it for now.",my 13900k already throttled running cb23 with arctic lf ii 360. ive been thinking of getting corsair h150i but its too much of a hassle since i need to remove the whole board from my casing to access the backplate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a custom water setup and stock my 13900k doesn't go past 85c in cb 23...i used xtu and the only thing i changed is core voltage to static @ 1.220 and it's never goes above 73c and i still score about 40300k in cb23 and i have 2 cores @6ghz the rest @ 5.5 ...didn't touch e cores,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"apparently you get better system stability setting that stuff in your bios but its great for testing it out and then once you're happy, setting it in your bios",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what bug are you talking about?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you set a custom power limit?,it'll throttle whatever cooling you have pretty much when default since its unlimited.,"got the same cooler, using 270w power limit, still gets real hot but doesn't throttle unless it's something super heavy or run over longer periods",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i couldn't undervolt mine neither.,have been trying that in xtu and in bios.,"xtu won't recognize the setting and in the bios although it take the input number, but doesn't really show any effect.",i read somewhere it say something about a voluntary bug in cpu so they stop support it for now.,is the undervolt helps this mid-end chip?,how much your system was changed when it disable?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

13700k is a good choice for a workstation.,i've built a couple 12700k (the slightly slower predecessor) workstations with 128 gb of ram and been very impressed with them.,"depending on throttling on your laptop, each core would be about twice as fast and you would get more of them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well itâ€™s not an issue of gaming vs non-gaming.,those can be one in the same.,it has to do with what kind of workload it requires.,"total core count, clock speed per core and/or memory needs.","given you are running it on a laptop with an 8 core/16 thread cpu, i would say something like the ryzen 7900/7950 or i7-13700k/i9-13900k.",no reference of your budget either.,that plays a part too.,can this software utilize cuda cores/gpu acceleration?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"depends on your budget, but imo 13600k plus 3200cl16 (or even lower timings if available) would be best.","13600k multi-threaded performance is very good, based on linux benchmarks.","of course if you have the money you can buy even higher end versions (13700k, 13900k).","i haven't looked at zen 4 benchmarks, but i guess that should also be pretty good.",maybe even 5800x3d with it's large amount of high speed cache.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what application it is?,it is can be multi threaded?,"if money is no objection and dependent on single core performance, 13900k or 13700k with 128 gb ddr5 is safe bet.","if its can be heavily multithreaded, you can look for amd's 7950x with the same 128 gb ddr5 because some app can be wonky with intel's p core e core setup.","if the price matter, what is your budget?",vague question like this are hard to pinpoint the answer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's wrong.,it's usually a much higher temp like 95c or 100c.,"although i guess if your motherboard vrms are bad, they can overheat and cause throttling even if cpu temperature is not that high.","i've used a 6600k for several years, in ambient temps of 40c+.",no throttling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
about 95c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i donâ€™t know why a c0 12400 would idle so high.,my 12900k idles under 8 watts.,the difference shown there is 15 vs 25wâ€¦ maybe they just got a bad c0 and a good h0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes it would be a pity if it's the case.,it seems it may not just be one sample : another review displays more idle consumption from the i5 12400 srl4v at idle compared to the 12600k for example.,not 25w but still significantly higher than its bigger brother.,"[https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3y8nd9bwtzc4vp9lxdmh75-1200-80.png.webp](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3y8nd9bwtzc4vp9lxdmh75-1200-80.png.webp)

what is final voltage and frequency outcome ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it won't.,poor joke.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all the new asus boards that have wifi use the intel chipset that includes bluetooth on the same antenna.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it has bluetooth and all the usb options that the strix has.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i usually watercool my components and wouldn't mind the extra headroom for oc.,does this not push a 13900k at all or is the 13900k itself not beneficial to push beyond stock?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i normally just use the ai overclocking on the mobo so whatever that gives i'm okay with it.,"as far as i can tell, there's no real-world performance gains especially in gaming oc'ing a 13900k?",what ram did you pair yours up with?,"i""m still trying to find some good ddr5 sticks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what are the top tier ones?,and things that would matter more for gaming performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ethernet problems like that are rma'able imo.,unacceptable.,i've returned a z490 board for the faulty intel iv225 nic.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are all of those drivers actually needed?,some are just software no?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whatâ€™s that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean pretty much any ddr5 5400+ is faster than what ddr4 offers no?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is my ddr5 6000mhz ok with this board?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there is no real performance gains overclocking it outside of synthetic benchmarks.,all i did was apply an undervolt of -0.075 and limited pl1 & pl2 to 253w and i maintained the same cinebench score of 40100 while using a lot less power and heat.,"for gaming, i'm gpu limited so i wouldn't see any changes from these modifications.",i'm using g.skill trident z5 series 64gb 6000mhz cas32.,"it took the xmp settings no problem, zero stability issues to speak of.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

as far as i remember you can only overclock the igpu on -k cpus.,"it used to be the case that you could undervolt it and the cpu to gain some performance within the thermal and power limits of your device, but that feature has been reserved for k cpus too.",from what i could find from reviews your laptop has a 11th gen u-series chip with a pl1/tdp of 28w.,"if it can handle it, you could try pushing your sustained power limits to 35w with throttlestop or intel xtu to get some 10% more performance, any higher doesn't make a difference if you have an 80eu part (i5), the igpu is already maxed out based on my own testing.","if that isn't an option, the most you can do to ensure maximum igpu performance is to make sure that both of your ram slots are populated so you are running in dual channel mode.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you could use something like techpowerup to increase the pl1 of the cpu.,"other than that, there is no way of overclocking the igpu in those cpus.",keep in mind that this will increase thermals or even not work at all.,"it could be that your laptop might have some battery preservation measures that prevents it to output relatively high wattage for what it was design for after a certain temp threshold, but i am not 100% sure.",i only talk about experience with an hp pavilion with an i5 1135g7 where i suffer this condition if i do not use it with ac power.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if there is no option in bios or intel xtu - no.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in laptops the sustained clock speeds aren't as high as they are on desktops.,cooling and the fan curve play huge factors for laptops.,i think msi has performance modes that set power limits and implement a more aggressive fan curve at the expense of heat and noise.,setting it to msi's highest performance mode is likely very close to the max performance possible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the part of the slide that mentioned dlvr was specifically about mobile rpl.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
could we actually be getting a 3rd gen of lga 1700 with raptor lak refresh with dlvr?,would make sense with the rumors of rpl refresh coming before mtl.,getting a nice power savings with no loss to perf could make for a decent refresh.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, whereâ€™s dlvr, intel?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
basically a voltage regulator/power conditioner.,"it only really helps save power in already lower-power regimes (< ~40w), which may explain why it's not enabled on desktop chips.",seems like it may have a decent impact on laptop skus at some point.,"if intel can squeeze a 25% power savings on the processor, that's roughly equivalent to a 15% increase in battery life with no impact to performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's a feature that helps decrease power consumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is what i thought.,dlvr was never mentioned for desktop cpus.,i am not sure what is happening here.,even ian cutress mentioned that he was demoed a chip with dlvr in israel couple of months ago and now its gone.,"&#x200b;

go with a 13 series unless your getting some insane deal on the 12 series.,tbh you won't really notice the difference between the 2 for 90% of the games and applications you will most likely run.,the larger cache and slightly higher base clocks of the 13 series are doing most of the heavy lifting.,it's a mild bump.,between the two at best.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ok but your not understanding me.,you say there's 10 + cases.,"i go to google and type in ""13900k degradation"" and nothing pops up.",i click your link and all its talking about is people overclocking their cpu and what settings they do.,"at no point do i see anyone say ""i was at stock and my cpu degraded"" like wtf are you talking about.",mce on 13th gen only unlocks power limits.,"it does nothing to voltage like gigabyte is with their ""instant 6ghz""  option

&#x200b;

so unelss you link me a comment with proof of degradation at stock with no overclocking.",then stop talking.,becaus theese chips are designed to be at 100c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well what iâ€™m saying is if you can 51 52 with e cores on, turn them off and test that up to 5.7. minimum should be able to do 5.4-5.5 based on your clocks with the e cores on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh so the vrms degraded that fast?,nah man.,this is normal behavior for cpus.,"they experience rapid degradation when you first get them (my 5ghz and 4.9ghz losses in the first few weeks) then depending on the voltage you hit them with, they degrade over time.",these modern chips having to face 1.5v is absolutely absurd and will result in dead chips well within their lifespan.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
where exactly did i say 'at stock with no overclocking'?,asus mce / gigabyte auto oc is not stock with no overclocking!,gigabyte shoving 1.5v into these chips for 6.0 on two cores is not stock with no overclocking.,what exactly is wrong with your reading comprehension?,"all the cases of degradation so far are with far less than 1.5v core voltage which this gigabyte feature is doing, and likely also less than whatever asus mce puts through them, i mean you are literally commenting in a thread about overclocking these chips to 6.0, not about running them at stock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's just absolutely not true.,intel 14nm could handle voltages like that just fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dude.,mce lifts power limits.,while considered an overclock i would consider it stock since they ship it default.,now.,mce only lifts power limits.,it does not raise core voltage.,so when you said.,mce and anything over 253 watts will degrade your chip.,i call bullshit.,"&#x200b;

if you raise voltage and oc then yeah of course your going to degrade your chip and shorten lifespan faster.",but what ?,your going from 10-15 years to 8-10 years lifespan?,come on man.,its like your fear mongering,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is true.,if a 65nm chip could experience much more degradation at 1.5v then a 14nm one which has far less atoms per transistor is going to experience electromigration even faster.,and my experience with this 7700k proves that to be true.,i didn't even push super hard with insane workloads and it still lost stability at previously good voltages multiple times.,"it's reality, it's physics and there's no avoiding it.","seriously go look into electromigration, read up on it and understand what it is.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tons of background processes can randomly put loads on one or more cores.,"and a range of between 50 and 65 is really not all over the place for a cpu thatâ€™s comfortable working up to 100.

thermal throttling?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's hwinfo, not hwmonitor.","look at usage, not utility.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
using utility instead of usage is fine.,"cpu usage readings are currently bugged on windows 11. spiking to 90% is fine, and you can try to get the average utility by resetting the statistics in hwinfo before your run.","also check your temperature, power consumption and clock speed.",cpu usage can be higher when it is thermal/power throttling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"impossible

i have h150i elite capellix, i also checked cpu temps and it's jumping between 45-55c(hitting low 40 in dead screen)

i played many aaa games or most demaging like warzone is now in 1440p/ultra and never seen this cpu hit more then 60c ( warzone 2 is most demanding with satble 50c with jumps to even 60c, not even god of war could go above 55c after 8 hours of playing)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, i was also looking at cpu usage but for sure something is wrong with how it's read.","cpu usage on hwinfo says: 3.7% (hard to believe it)

"utility is bs, look at usage alone and nothing else.","just not the averaged one, reset ui layout and unwind it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cpu usage is what you want to look at.,it measures the amount of time the cpu is active or idle.,cpu utility is a kind of measure of how much with the cpu does and because of how itâ€™s normalized it can exceed 100%.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if the issue persists when you put the stock intel frame back on then the problem is with the backplate or the screw.,"takes some pictures front and back of the motherboard and makes sure the screws are going in on the back, it might have been dislocated/misaligned.",the allen key provided is correct.,unless you turn it incorrectly or the screw isn't aligned with the screw hole there's no reason it would come back out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have one ordered, i have not tried it yet.",you still using the stock backplate?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there might be an issue where the thermal grizzly requires longer screws on some mainboard/13 gen cpus.,the frame should screw into the backplate that came with the mainboard.,so not the cooler back plate but the backplate that came with the mainboard.,basically the cooler backplate holds on the mainboards backplate then you screw in the cpu frame to the mainboard backplate.,should be installation videos on youtube.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes it is ripped off.,i had a 12600kf just like yours.,i bought it in the local computer store.,"**i opened the cpu box in front of the salesman, and luckily found the back of the cpu had a capacitor ripped off just like yours**.","my old post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/intel/comments/vllg6f/share\_two\_experiences\_of\_buying\_faulty\_cpus\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/intel/comments/vllg6f/share_two_experiences_of_buying_faulty_cpus_and/)

since it was opened under the eyes of the salesman, i requested an immidiate switch rather than going through warranty which usually takes 6+ weeks based on my experience with 9600kf (see next paragraph)... but at the beginning the store manager **wasn't willing to switch a new one** for me.","then, i immediately called the after-sales service centre of the centrecom headquarter.","after they understood the situation, they promised to replace me with a new cpu.","at that time, the store manager did not believe me, and even took my phone and asked the guy on the other side of my phone who he was (lmfao).","later, he reluctantly gave me a new cpu.... the new cpu did not have any defect capacitor... so, i can confirm you that some new cpu products are defect products.",so be careful.,why did i open my 12600kf under the eyes of the store salesman?,"because **i fkin had a 9600kf two years ago and also a ripped off capacitor in the back**... so when i bought my 12600kf i was very, very cautious.","sounds crazy, but thanks to my cautiousness...

ps: i know this experience sounds crazy, but this is what happened to me and i believe (and don't expect others to believe) that there are many new cpus out there with ripped-off capacitors that go unnoticed by the buyers.","so in the future, when i buy another new cpu, i will continue to open the box under the eyes of the store salesman so that intel won't rip me off.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

dual intel 2.5g ethernet is ok and you can video edit off from 2.5gb, over all the board looks good, and i see no real issues that would stop me from buying this board other then price ill wait and see.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"looking forward to this, haven't been impressed by the x13sae",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are there any board with a pci-e switch?,"also, i wonder if they sell the ipmi card separately.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so gigabyte will be the only ddr4 oneâ€¦

thatâ€™s inconvenient since ddr5 ecc is fairly difficult to find.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"remarkably, it also has a thunderbolt header.",i'm pretty sure this feature was much anticipated by some.,no clue why did other manufactures decided that tb is not really needed in a workstation mb.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i need this asap!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the dual x4 slots (disguised as x16 slots) can be used for additional 10 gbe cards or nvme ssds too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the ipmi model already has an ipmi pcie x1 card bundled.,"by the way, i am sure that there are switches below the pcb, judging the dual pcie 5.0 x16 (x8/x8) slots.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wait.,in what latest segment is gigabyte still in ddr4?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
given the sad state of availability of all the other w680 boards i'm not hopeful :-(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah but using them for nvme bottlenecks the chipset as it is maxed out with the 3 m.2 drives adding 4 or 5 is useless unless you need redundancy and yeah a 10gb nic would be better, also many gpu tasks would be fine in a pcie 4x slot so the board is very usable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
w680.,their mw34-sp0 is ddr4 for alder lake (and maybe raptor lake).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i tend to agree with you.,i asked asus chat and they were clueless.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ah.,the lack of ddr5 support is compensated by pcie gen5 from xpu for x16 slots.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"personally, iâ€™d rather just repurpose my 128gb of ddr4 ecc rather than buying ddr5 ecc.",especially since alder lake memory controller has support for it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'd say not that much in single core performance, since the 13400f will use a 12600k die

on the other hand, multi core should be better since there will be 4 e cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not much 5-10% and a big bump in power usage... so would stick with 12th gen... they are really good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lighter wallet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if the 13400 is priced well the extra 4 e cores could be nice for multi thread performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so far the prices on the 13th gen isn't that interesting vs. the 12th (since those are getting cheaper atm) so the minimal performance gain isn't that interesting (so far),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea if it's not cheaper then the 12600k it will basically be pointless,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
use hwinfo64.,hwmonitor is known to show wrong values.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
set power plan to *high performance*,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
might be able to get around it by setting the affinity in task manager for the program?,task manager/details/select affinity for the program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"true, but given op's 65 watt power draw and 57-65 c temperatures(higher on e cores), it would seem to validate the theory the p cores aren't being utilized.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its already set on high performance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok but you can't trust hwmonitor to begin with.,who's to say even that 65w reported draw is accurate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, donâ€™t set power plan to high performance.",leave it on balanced unless you feel like burning extra power and producing extra heat for zero real-world benefit.,do set power mode to best performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've found hwmonitor to usually be more accurate than other programs.,usually when a value is wrong its way off and obvious.,and 3 stats all aligning is a good sign of accuracy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
going to try this thank you!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so i've set the power mode to best performance and p cores are being used together with e cores while building vs code.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hwmonitor has been shown & proven to erroneously read out data going back to as far as 2013. it hasn't improved in a decade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so itâ€™s working now?,"windows typically aggressively forces non-foreground applications onto the e-cores, unless you have a multi-monitor setup or change the setting i mentioned.","but not doing it really shouldnâ€™t make your system choppy, more the opposite, so iâ€™m not sure what was going on there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is from gaming.,new laptop.,do you suggest i return it?,this is my second time returning same model if i doâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what precisely are you referring to?,"an mei driver for a z790 board, or an updated driver for 13th gen on 12th gen board?","also, what motherboard?","with that said, randomly selecting the z790 hero, i see driver v2220.3.1.0(package v2225.3.9.0) on the download page.","which seems newer than the one on the z690 hero page (but the same versioning, so i wonder if theyâ€™re actually compatible).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

my issue was whea-errors in windows.,"but it turns out it wasn't the mei afterall, i've updated the drivers, the me firmware and the bios.",in the end it was the pcie to u.2 adapter that my optane ssd was in.,"it's pcie gen 3 while the ssd and the motherboard are both gen 4. it works enough to not fail immediately, but causes errors.",i had to try everything before isolating this to the ssd.,"i've never had whea errors that were storage related before, i assumed it was a cpu or memory issue for a solid 4+ hours.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i wouldn't give even 100-150 euro for this cpu.,"here maybe you get it under 200 since it's your money:

"that motherboard is not gonna pair well with a 9700k x)

you might aswell sell your current cpu and mb, and then spend your money on a new platform (e.g 5600x + b550 mb about 250-300â‚¬)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you have all the boosts enabled?,any overclock?,"if not, even though these temps are within spec, try undervolting (-0.1v), helps a ton with temps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

80c while gaming is not normal.,not bad though.,but not normal.,13900k with an 360 aio lands me around 65c with mw2.,and that is with a hotter chip,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have the z63 for my 5800x (which is known to run hot) and it only hits up to the 60s when gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"- 0.1 is a lot, iâ€˜d start with -0.025 offset undervolt, which brought me down almost 10c in cb r23 on a 12700k",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sorry, i forgot to mention the 81c is the max spike i see.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
either way.,max spike for me while playing mw2 even warzone is 71. mw2 is not that power hungry.,im assuming its either poor contact or poor mount.,assuming this is not during loading but during actual gameplay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can.,but with a stock cooler that will probably thermal throttle within seconds.,theres a reason why those presets are there.,but again.,you can try and see what that gets you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this dialog only exists because it's impossible to quickly programmatically check (or benchmark) performance of your cooling system drivers/bios/uefi or whatever can not just look inside your computer case to see what's installed or make burn-in tests so just better check what you have.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, you can.","it tops at around 110 watts, so basic 92mm tower can cool it.","wouldn't attempt that with stock cooler, it can only handle 65-70 watts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
without other overclock your 10400f might peak out at ~130w.,you could do a benchmark before and after setting to see performance and temp diff.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you can,but expect thermal throttling.",to gain performance you would be better off undervolting except to get -50--100mv+-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
benchmark with and without it and see what happens.,if it gets too hot just shut the program down and put it back to the boxed cooler setting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it will probably work the stock cooler but it will probably spin faster thinking its an aio and kill the tiny cooler probably good idea buy a tower cooler or aio,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just set to water cool, if your load doesnâ€™t make the cpu throttle/overheat it doesnâ€™t matter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
buy this $20 cooler and then remove the power limit.,https://pcpartpicker.com/product/q6h7yj/thermalright-assassin-x-120-refined-se-6617-cfm-cpu-cooler-ax120-se-d3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i get 80c at heavyload,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

should i make before and after benchmark with cinebench to see if more power will increase performance?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
define heavy loadâ€¦ like cinebench?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
feel free to do so.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would say prime95 then log temp with hwinfo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, you should.","can you post the scores here too, please?",just curious ðÿ¤“,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sure i bet you will just hit thermal throttling with the stock cooler.,if that's what happens your best bet is to just undervolt for the extra performance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
like when playing games like red dead redemption 2 and spiderman miles morales,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gaming is not a heavy load.,if its that high during gaming then yeah that cooler aint going to cut it.,try cinebench.,see how high your temps get.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
does cinebench monitor temp?,or i need another tool to monitor my cpu temp?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol if gaming is what he's doing with the system then how is gaming not a valid test of the system.,that said i do agree that a cooler upgrade would be best.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
download hwinfo64 .,its free.,"then when it asks to start check the box that says ""sensors only"" and it will also probably ask you if its ok to use certain sensors and make sure you hit yes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"core temp is a good program, i use it for my i9-11900k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because cpu while gaming does not equal full load.,the only way to tell if your stable or thermally ok is if you use occt or cinebench.,if your not stable then games will not be stable.,while the 10400f is probably coming up on age it wont get far because he is overclocking but thermally limited.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"done, max temp while benchmarking 83c",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for your help,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, but if that is the highest load he will put it under, full load is irrelevant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"while thatâ€™s ok, if you lift power limits you will definitely be at 100c with a stock cooler.",my suggestion is either upgrade your cooler or keep limits in place.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but thats not the point.,"the point is, if he is getting 80c in games then overclocking will just put more strain and thermally throttle him.",it wont get him anywhere.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no this temp while water cooler checked on cpu tuning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah i get that, but a synthetic load won't be realistic to what the system is doing.",it won't actually show him the conditions that cause throttling in daily use.,"i do agree that the best route is a better cooler, and potentially an undervolt to allow it to boost longer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
game and resolution dependent.,ask again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depending on games and settings it may vary a lot.,"buth chances are the 1080ti is going to cause quite the cpu bottle neck with an i5 6500. you can always get the gpu and game now and save to upgrade to say a 12400,12600k or 13400 if they are good deals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it will be cpu limited.,"if you already have i5 6500, you can still use it until you upgrade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's really hard to say without knowing the types of games you play.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pretty sure it will be cpu bottlenecked.,"i used to run the i5 7500 with a gtx1070 and it nearly hits the bottleneck, so an older cpu paired with an even higher tier gpu is definitely going to see bottlenecks.","btw if you want to get another cpu just skip the 8600k, get the newer i3/i5s instead.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm using the unify-x and it easily runs my 7200 xmp kit.,"that said, i don't think having 2 dimm slots matter too much if you aren't running ddr5 above 6600-6800 speeds on 13th gen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you mean z790, then obviously unify-x is for ram aggressive overclocking, if you mean z690, then unify have some higher grade utility gimmicks and convenient overclocking features, like slow boot, safe boot and other stuff.","if you don't intend to squish last juices out of your hardware, simple settle for z790-a or p pro.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, but z690 carbon has all of the same as the non-x unify, right?","i want an 8-layer pcb and integrated io shield, so the pros are a no-go.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the z690 unify (non-x) has a much beefier vrm than the carbon (19+2/105a vs 18+1+1/75a).,"the unify has the extra lan port, and an additional internal usb header.",it also lacks igpu support (there is no power delivery to the igpu section of the cpu).,"there may be more minor details, but thatâ€™s what i noted when i was shopping.","and frankly, i too donâ€™t see why someone would pick the unify over the unify-x or carbon.","but if you donâ€™t have a choice, itâ€™s not that itâ€™s a bad board.","as a video editor, i would love a premium 2 dimm board with igpu support and tb4.","sadly, probably never going to see that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks.,"yeah, i am leaning towards just going with the z690 carbon as i don't think i care too much about 6600 vs 7000-7200, unless i am misunderstanding that this would only result in a real system performance improvement of 3-5%.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice upgrade !,can you write whole old setup and new one?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the new box style is basically the modern version of the older box styles 6th gen- 9th gen definitely had the more unique design which looks really nice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

my favorite component purchases were the oem parts that came in anti-static bags and a white envelope.,it just feels more pro-sumer if it comes without fancy packaging,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
naah.,"especially the ""for a great vr experience"" quotes don't age well.","what would the new cpus have, ""for a great metaverse experience""?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
still running the 8086k in my system with a 3070 ti.,"it'll probably be the last graphics card it ever sees, though.","side note, this box style was unique to the 8th generation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

saving on ink,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
definitely glad i chose the 8700k over the r5 1600. aged much better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,colorful retail packages for a component is just wasteful & dumb.,"make it black and white, put the specifications and requirements and call it a day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are the edge of consumer computing and now it looks like the chip belongs in a soul crushing office.,just a cpu sitting on a shelf in the it overflow storage room.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"frankly, they should just make the box a lot smaller and save all the extra plastic/paper and etc.",save our environment!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
idk why anyone cares what kinda box they have lol.,idk why a cpu box is bigger than my $1000 cellphone box ðÿ¤·â€â™‚ï¸,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i agree the appeal on the old box has more into it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the whole minimalist design hype is getting kinda boring,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i agree the 13700k box is bland af.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"good god, that old box is ugly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you and i made very similar upgrades.,the i7-8700k was an amazing cpu while i had it.,pushed it to a solid 5.0ghz overclock.,the old box style looked great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
honestly itâ€™s kinda silly to make the boxes look so good considering very few of us will see one in a store or pick it off a shelf.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the new redesign of the old one is much more recognisable on a shelf tbf.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't you know all sharp angles are new design hype... before that it was round corners.,before that..dark coloring..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i like the minimal design, but i literally couldn't care less what the box looks like considering i never look at it more than once.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's in keeping with the current fashion of flat design that was inspired by the move of mobile design toward simple flat images rather than the skeuomorphic design (images based on real things) that preceded it.,but on mobile at least there was a point to; getting rid of 3d and transparency effects simplified graphics rendering and lengthened battery life.,i'm not a fan of that trend.,the results are often very bland.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13900k comes in a wafer.,that is so dope.,but not worth 300 euro more then 13700k in europe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why bother?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the new box looks a bit more professional honestly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i honestly like the 13 gen one more, but the 8 gen one is also fine",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

they went from something cool to 2000s dvd graphics for all the upcoming movies they stuff into them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh shit, first glance i thought right was the new, because how flashy it look.",but i was wrong :(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 7700k and 8700k boxes were the best,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, the current box design treats me like an adult.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the old ones are a lot more ugly imo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have a big moving box for pc hardware

i dont really care how they all look.",i just keep some for when/if i need to sell it.,"its easier to ship it, in the box its designed for",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"see the thing with the old box is i put it on a shelf because it looks good, but the new one is so bland i donâ€™t think iâ€™m going to.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it did me well but it was starting to show its age with a 3090. was definitely one of the best from intel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

loved these.,speciall the i7-3960x black edition i had.,thinking about itâ€¦i cant recall to get rid of the box.,need.,to.,find.,it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that was my dream cpu with a c2d e7500 in 2013,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was looking at just getting a 9900k but i couldnâ€™t find a used one that wasnâ€™t overpriced.,so i. inured just upgrade to this and keep it for next 5-6 years,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

well at 4k you should be completely graphic card bound.,i am at 1440p looking for over 144hz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ngl back then i buy gpus based on the box design (on the same chip),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah if it looks cheap i know it's not intel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"no, that's not how bottlenecks work.","not only does it vary from game to game so you really cannot say that it ""should"" be anything, but on a vrr display you should always cap to somewhere within your gsync/freesync range anyway (generally about 3 fps or so lower than your monitor's max refresh rate) so there's no ""should"" about it.",i am nearly always limited by that before i am my cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
amazing card.,i've had it since launch with oc 9700k running 3440x1440 120hz and still enjoying the experience.,rarely have issues besides some cpu bottlenecks with games like spiderman.,will probably upgrade in the next 1-2 years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i would say 80â°c is pretty good.,"with my be quiet dark rock pro 4 i cant even run cinebench r23 without thermal throttling, with stock settings at least.",to reduce the temps you can try to undervolt.,an offset of -0.1v should be very safe.,i undervolted my 13700k to -0.125v.,"i could do more, but -0,125v is very stable (at stock clocks).","with that undervolt the cpu runs more than 10â°c cooler, because instead of 250-260watts it only draws 200-210watts in cinebench r23 (and no thermal throttling).","funnily enough, my p-core 5 is also the hottest.","i think this is what the 12th gen contact frame is for, so the heat gets distributed more equally.",but some cores just get hotter than others.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thanks for the info.,"that's what i was thinking, managing the different kind of workloads with power limits and undervolt depending on the needs if one wants to gain a bit of performance while staying under the thermal and power throttles.",so in a sense it's pretty similar to what you do with zen 3 or 4 when it comes to managing power/thermal limits and voltage/frequency offsets to gain performance while managing temps and power draw.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"seems like you might need a slightly better cooler, but rpl in general runs very hot and is designed to be that way, would not worry about temps; i simply was trying to explain why you may have uneven temps: to add on to my earlier statement not all cores are made equally in the first place and you may just lose the silicon lottery on one.",another explanation is that cores 4 and typically 5 are preferred cores for intel meaning they usually get the brunt of the load first and typically are asked to do more.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

indeed.,"i was not expecting it at 8 threads versus a tiny laptop, however.",i never found a good upgrade path for the 1950x.,"the 2950x was a marginal improvement and then amd changed the socket, so now i am trying to make the most out of it until it dies of natural causes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"8 threads is only quad-core, the old intel desktop standard that got them into trouble years ago.","only besting a quarter of 1st gen threadripper (while at only 16 cores which did give it an upper hand at multicore performance, zen 1 was still ever so slightly behind intel at the time in per-core performance in 2018) isnâ€™t much.",an 8-core mobile ryzen slapped the living daylights out of 1st gen threadripper a couple generations ago.,intel is only now getting up to speed on the multicore performance front in ulv laptop processors (meaning 25w and below).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's not.,no tpm 2.0 support unless mobo manufacturer supports it.,the 1950x's were never really top tier performers.,"they were just top tier compared to intel's offerings at the time, especially at that price range.",pretty easy these days to beat a 1950x.,"the fact that it only ""supported"" 2666mhz ddr4 and 4.0 single core max boost clock was super, super dumb.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

your temps are way too high.,iâ€™m seeing 55-65c while gaming in mw2 on my i9 13900k.,cooler is corsair h115i capellix.,i do have the thermal right frame as well.,mw2 doesnâ€™t seem to stress it out at all.,so if youâ€™re hitting 90c youâ€™ve got cooler issues.,what cooler are you using?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hitting 90c.... while gaming?,something is wrong.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what resolution do you play at?,the cpu just spike up to that temp quickly?,% cpu utilization when the temperature hits 90c?,case have ok cooling?,gpu temperature?,gpu air flow go over the cpu?,changing the fan curves help?,90s still ok but likely able to make it cooler without changing hardware.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
enter cooler master evo 212â€¦.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mine doesnâ€™t even hit 75c in blenderâ€¦ take the plastic off your cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what cooling are you using?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is why i bought a 13600k i can just air cool the thing and it doesn't get much worse frames,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 90c is most likely hit during loading screens when the cpu actually has to work hard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it aint too bad if you are on air, but if aio - something is wrong.",maybe settings in bios?,some auto oc on?,(so it clocks way too high and might even have bad vf curve for the cpu.),i would suggest you going through the bios and setting maybe intel limits on?,and auto clocks etc.,"mostly defaults but be aware some motheboards have unlimited power on by default and you maybe do not want that ;/

how is the thermal paste applied?",how is the cooler contact?,pressure?,all triple checked?,maybe opt for a contact frame?,undervolting the cpu?,i am on a custom'ish loop (ryujin2 + some extra bananas) and with close to default clocks in mw2 my cpu pulls around 120w and temps are 20 degrees above water temperature.,"water is at 35 and cpu is below 60. 

on a full load my cpu pulls easily over 300w and temps stay below 100.

when i have 6,2p & 4,6e oc on i pull 200w on mw2 and temps are at 65 ish.",\[well i do currently also have that oc on but not on heavy loads just because there is no need for it.,heavy loads goes close to stock speeds atm\],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my 13700k reaches max 81c in mw2 on p core # 4. all other cores are 10 degrees lower than #4. is something wrong here?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when i tried mw2 dmz mode my average was 55c.,for both teh cpu and gpu.,there are a few things you can do to help with temps of the 13900k.,i use a thermalright contact frame.,you don;t necessarily need it but it may help a little.,so due to the ilm on z690 at least it exerts an enormous amount of pressure on the cpu.,"this causes it to bend and therefore the contact with the air cooler, aio copper plate is not that great.",what the contact frame does is just secures the cpu in place without the pressure of the ilm.,this cause a more even surface for best possible contact.,some people report big temp drops but in my own experience it only dropped mine like 2-3 degrees.,it could be more for you or less i can;t say for sure.,i run a -0.09v voltage offset on the cpu.,i limit the performance core ratio to 55 all of them.,i also change the loadline calibration to llc4 (this on an asus motherboard).,because i only game i set both pl1 and pl2 to 90 w. you can set it higher like 120 or 253w.,whatever you feel comfortable with.,i run a -0.09v voltage offset on the cpu.,i limit the performance core ratio to 55 all of them.,i also change the loadline calibration to llc4 (this on an asus motherboard).,"in the top left corner of your mother =board you should see a 8 pin pci-e socket, labeled cpu how many do you have.",i do believe most modern motherboards especially those aimed at overclocking have 2. plug both in.,up until recently i only ever plugged one in and apparently it drops temps if you have two plugged in.,and it worked how much it drops i guess varies.,hope this helps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
90 c is fine the cpu is designed to run up to 100 c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
90c while gaming????,gaming pulls like 90-150w of power.,not even the full 253w its rated for.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for a 13900k you should be using 360mm aio atleast to cool... buying a 1300k i presume your overclocking because you got the k version...240mm won't be enough to cool the beast,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can pull over 180w while gaming.,depends on the game and settings.,the 90c might also just be a random less than a second spike vs a steady temperature.,might just be bad case cooling or some other thing.,could be a variety things.,need more info.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

any pricing increase arguably makes a few skus worse buys.,"take the 13100 vs 12100, right now the indications are going to be a 100mhz clock speed bump.",anything more than 5% price bump in that case makes the 13100 worse value on the cpu alone.,"this isn't even accounting for the motherboard situation in that boards that support the 13100 out of the box will likely be more expensive than those that support the 12100. existing budget b660/h610 boards will not have a bios that supports 13th gen. 

the 13400 vs 12600k is another interesting example.",12600k in many regions (most major ones) are selling below launch rcp now.,"this means any increase in rcp for the 13400 vs the 12400 essentially starts running the price up close to that of the existing 12600k, which will still be faster (10%+ higher clocks) and possibly better in other ways (unlocked sa voltage).",you also avoid the previously mentioned motherboard issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it depends entirely on the use case.,"i would get the a770 if you will meet the following conditions:

1) have a cpu with resizable bar enabled.","2) have a 1440p monitor, it also works fine on 1080p but performance wise it compares well to the amd and nvidia equivalent at 1440p.",3) play newer titles with dx12 or vulcan.,4) have any need for hardware encoding av1 since it does very well.,"if you donâ€™t have resizable bar capability or play games that are dx9, itâ€™s not worth getting.","in my use case playing warzone 2, cyberpunk and red dead redemption 2 it has been absolutely stellar.",iâ€™ve had zero issues with drivers as well.,"for the games i play, the performance has been on par with a 3060 ti or a 3070. the ray tracing performance has been really good for a first gen product as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i am using one and i have been loving it so far.,i did get it with the expectation of tinkering though so if you don't have that same mindset maybe don't.,i think the benchmarks show maybe the 6700xt is a better buy though so maybe look into that as well.,i use a 750w power supply as that's what was in my case.,it plays spiderman beautifully.,which is what i am currently playing.,i was having an xess issue with spiderman and i believe hdr conflicting in some way that i ended up just disabling hdr and using vivid mode on the oled and i can't really tell the difference anyway.,but you can see the settings and frame rate in the video i posted for that issue.,"basically 4k, fsr/xess quality, high preset graphics, ray tracing on with defaults as is.",i get 70 fps.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsklpujexk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"first off, it was never necessary, the cpus can run without them, they would have been recalled if not.","they just improved cooling, the degree which depending on your motherboard and heatsink.","i honestly can't find any tests done with z790, and considering there was always some variance with how much the contact frame helped between manufacturers, i'd say it's plausible work was done on it.","honestly, i'd first ask if the cold plate on your heatsink convex or flat?","if it's convex, then you wouldn't need a contact frame even with z690, so no worries.","if it's flat, it couldn't hurt to try a contact frame, but i'd probably see how it runs beforehand unless you already have a contact frame lying around.","i know that answer isn't totally satisfactory, but without someone having done tests it's the best i can say.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
per intel - â€œwe strongly recommend against any modifications to the socket or independent loading mechanism.,"such modifications would result in the processor being run outside of specifications and may void any product warrantiesâ€

https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-comments-on-alder-lakes-warping-and-bending-issues-mods-void-warranty",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would recommend using one.,the cpu frame is the same essentially as on z690 boards.,i used 3 of these so far they are easy to use just be careful.,used this on a 13900k also it's fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks guys, i guess i'll try it without the contact frame first and see if the temps are ok",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not necessary.,i've been using gigabyte z690 aorus pro with a 13900k without issue.,i would imagine z790 isn't much different.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think you might be mistaken.,the contact frame is not for the temps it was never was.,it was due to the ilm (intel locking mechanism) putting to much force  on the cpu and bending them making them uneven.,this caused the uneven surface.,the reason intel never recalled them as they don't acknowledge it as an issue.,the lower temps are a bonus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i donâ€™t know why you are getting downvoted but my take on this is how does the contact frame run it out of spec by correcting the ilm?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it varies from motherboard to motherboard.,i have 2 asuâ€™s motherboards i used them on both.,personally i only saw a minor drop in temps 2-3 degrees so not a major drop.,but primarily i bought the thermalright one which was like â£15 for peace of mind for both the 12900k and 13900k setups that i have.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the contact frame is for temps actually.,"check thermal grizzly's website, they talk about heatsink contact and heat dissipation.","https://www.thermal-grizzly.com/produkte/522-cpu-contact-frame-for-12th-gen-intel-by-der8auer

and intel has addressed the issue.",they refer to it as deflection.,"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-comments-on-alder-lakes-warping-and-bending-issues-mods-void-warranty

yes, the contact frames address the concavity, but why is that important?",because it impacts temperature.,the concavity doesn't violate your warranty.,it doesn't cause the cpu to stop working.,"it is a problem because it can cause poor contact with a heatsink, which result it higher temps due to poor heat dissipation.","the bending and the heat problem are literally one in the same, because the only issue caused by the bending is the heat.","which is why if you have a convex coldplate there's no worries, because a slight bend wouldn't hurt contact with the heatsink.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have that same question,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel left it a while before commenting on this issue.,i used a 12900k for quite a while until it would not boot with 4 ram sticks.,this was down to the bending causing bad contact with the pins.,"the 12900k came out in october/november 2021 and the article was in april 2022.

many people raised or posted about the issue and intel would not acknowlege it at first.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no the contact frame absolutely is to prevent the cpu from bending.,"the reason some people see improved temps right away is because it also flattens any variances in stock ihs curvature, almost like lapping.","this is what happens when you use a 12th / 13th gen cpu without the contact frame:

they still work, hence why theres no product recall or anything from intel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you can, just do it.","if your power supply lacks it, you will probably be fine.",but thereâ€™s zero reason not to connect it if you can.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the short answer is it depends, usually it will function at stock settings no with no issues.",the second connection is usually for overclocking or cpus with crazy core counts like xeons or threadripper.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, you're fine with a single 8 pin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the wires do not push more power to the cpu.,more wires just divide the current so there is less current and thus theoretically less losses per wire.,but they all go to same place.,actually as long as your cpu doesn't go much over 300w you should be fine with one 8 pin connector.,the recent trend of putting two connectors to motherboard is not based on any real need except in motherboards meant for hardcore overclocking.,you could probably get the cpu to work fine with just a four pin connector.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so heres what you can do.,first run hwinfo and see what your pl1 and pl2 are set at.,"look at the wattage your cpu package is using, and note the frequency each core is running at when running cinebench.",also note the temperature.,these things will help you tune your system.,as you play with the bios settings you can watch these figures and make intelligent choices as to what you find acceptable for your use case.,look at them before playing with the bios settings.,does pl1 and pl2 say 253watts?,how do you know you're not unlimited already?,this is one way to find out.,253watts is the specs.,the next thing to do is go into your bios.,the terminology can vary between bios but typically you will see a pl1 and pl2 setting.,pl meaning power limit.,"in my msi uefi bios, it says long duration power limit and short duration power limit instead of pl1 and pl2.","also in the msi bios there is a section where they ask if you're using a stock cooler, a tower cooler or a water cooler.",this is basically a shortcut in the bios to set the pl1 and pl2 values.,"for exaple, stock has a 253watt pl1/pl2 limit.","tower cooler has a 288watt power limit, and water cooler has a 4096watt power limit value which is absolutely so ridiculous that it's called ""unlimited"".",no aio is going to cool this chip well enough beyond the stock spec of 253watts.,however the stock spec of 253 watt pl1/pl2 seems to throttle the frequencies earlier than if you ran it in unlimited mode (at least on my msi z790 carbon).,"for example, instead of letting the cpu hit 100c at 5.5 all p-cores, and 4.3 all e-cores.","it will keep the cpu under 80c, and throttle the p cores to like 5.0-5.1 and the e-cores to 3.5 to 4.1. or somewhere close to that.","so performance for me is actually worse if i limit the cpu to the stock 253w pl1 pl2 value because on my h170i aio  with a 420mm radiator... i can let the chip run at 100c, with a solid 5.5 p core, and 4.3 e core speed.",so unlimited is actually faster... but hotter.,"the point is... this chip runs fast, and wild... but you must tame it with cooling.",it will run at 100c.,"it will protect itself so you dont have to worry about that... but in order to run it unlimited, you're going to need the best cooling you can afford, and honestly, there isn't really a cooler that can keep this thing away from 100c when running unlimited unless you're doing something exotic which is impractical for normal daily use.",there is one exception to this.,"on my h170i 420mm aio, i can keep it around 90c if i undervolt the cpu using ""mode 7"" instead of the default ""mode 9"".",it's pretty stable too.,right now i'm still using the default mode 9 though.,"so you're going to look at those values as you play with the bios settings i've mentioned, and make sure you have a good enough cooler to handle the heat as best as possible because it will use up every bit of that 100c temperature.",find a setting you you like.,"if it throttles at 100c, perhaps back off, perhaps check the seating of your cooler to make sure its making good contact.","this chip requires some work to make the most out of because it's ""unlimited"" nature allows us to play and tinker until we find our own individual performance settings.",36k isn't terrible in cinebench.,i get 39k+ i've hit 41k with some overlocking (58 x p core) that i would not feel comfortable using 24-7 just for the slightly bigger number than 39k that i get at default with 55 x p core and a 4096w pl1 pl2.,although i probably could run 58 x i'm just not going to do do that to my new chip this year ;) maybe next year.,haha.,"anyways i came from a 3970x 32 core threadripper, that could easily get 45k in cinebench but the 13900k's single core performance is so much better than the threadripper so i'm very happy with it.",i still have my threadripper so i can render on both of them and heat the house this winter.,btw when you're benching to find the best score... quit any thing running in the system tray that might be taking performance away from you.,keep hwinfo running but kill everything else so you have 1% cpu usage at idle before benching.,that alone might improve your benchmark scores enough to make you happy :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have a 12900k also with uhd770, but chose a board, that comes with tb4.","the tb4 certification forced asus to support hbr3 speeds, even though they do not list this support anywhere explicitly (and it can run my aw3821 at full bandwidth).",so it is definitely not a limitation of the uhd770 itself.,there are also a few boards that either list hbr3 support explicitly or list 5k or 8k resolutions that would not be feasible without it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dang this was really informative.,learn something new everyday.,"good to know about the differences between hbr2/3, my mb is a asus tuf gaming z690 plus d4, so its on the cheaper side.",got it with the recent black friday sales going on.,"its honestly not a deal breaker, i guess i could get a cheap gpu and drive the monitor at the full refresh rate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"depends on the model of laptop, because if they put a worse chip on more power it will be better, but all things being equal, the 11800h is about 10 percent better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the fan being full of gunk looks like more of an issue.,canâ€™t tell anything about the chip from this photo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
who knows.,you canâ€™t tell anything by looking at it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i mean, there's no visible catastrophic damage.",doesn't mean it can't be broken.,what's the problem?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looks to me like your tech is assuming the chip is fried because of the thermal paste (it almost certainly isnâ€™t).,however nothing in the comments actually indicates the chip is fried.,so far it looks like a simple dust and re-paste job.,how the tech came to the fried chip answer is a bit suspect given that nothing was tried.,sounds to me like they are trying to take advantage of someone who isnâ€™t tech literate and is doing an upsell since youâ€™d have to do several things before coming to his conclusion (i.e.,"check that battery holds a charge, charge is flowing, etc).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"bruh it's the thermal paste
clean it off with alcohol and cotton swabs.","you also might want to look into your fan, it will create a problem later.","after the cleaning process is done, replace your old thermal paste with a new one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"burnt chip can have a small bump on them, but thats not always the case.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"looks fine, paste seems to have solidified.","you can clean the cpu, fan of the old paste and respaste.",the fan needs cleaning.,what seems to be the problem ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
start at battery and power supply .,clean the fan also ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you mean hard reset and clean the fans ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that fan does,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would replace thermal paste .,that one is dry.,also clean se fan.,just brush it.,but be sure to unplug hit first of the motherboard before cleaning.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
frued there are wrinkles under it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
change the paste!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s thermal paste on the chip no?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dust in the nvme slot or an improperly installed drive can cause failure to post also try various ram configurations mqy help too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ðÿ˜‚ðÿ˜‚ðÿ˜‚,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably not.,looks like old thermal paste and a dirty fan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
time to buy a new laptop.,time to let this one go.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep sheâ€™s fried you can tell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i will try cleaning the fans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how can i know ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my laptop is not turning on and a guy is saying this is the problem but it doesn't make sense to me since as you said it doesn't look broken and it's very rare for the hm570 chipset to get fried,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the laptop turned off i took it to a service he said the cause of the problem is this chip but it doesn't make sense to me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks i will try doing it i hope it works,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would replace the thermal paste too since the heat sink is already off,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what problem are you trying to diagnose?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the laptop isn't turning on at all?,how did this guy decide that the issue much be a fried chipset?,that's such a rare failure and there's so many other things that are more likely to fail and also cause a laptop not to turn on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
one of the most common issues with the fx505 & fx506 boards is that the bios becomes corrupted.,"as people are saying it is very rare for this chipset to fail, usually when it does fail there is visible damage to the silicon, ie cracks or even exploded off silicon.","go to a reputable repair person who can probe 3.3v, 5v and 12v rails.",make him check if voltage is being supplied to the ec and bios chip.,does the laptop show a charging light when plugged in?,did the laptop turn off after doing a â€˜windows updateâ€™?,thatâ€™s the most common way these crappy asus laptops brick themselves.,"after all these years asus still make amateur board designs, great for us technicians to make money off but not any good for the consumerâ€¦

edit: ah i see it turns on to a blank screen, mate grab a soic 8 flasher, skypro programmer or something similar, get that pesky bios chip desoldered and flash a new bios onto the chip, 90% sure it will power on.",iâ€™ve fixed about 20 out of 30 of these models (fx505 and fx506 with a simple bios flash.,although this is not always the case.,3.3v rail is common to go on this board too.,does the keyboard light up white too?,"sorry for rambling on, hope this helps you if not someone with the same issueâ€¦",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you've got a multimeter, you can check nearby coils/caps for shorts.","if the chipset is dead, it'll short to ground.","(not 100% it will, but a good chance it will.","it can also indicate that some other spot is shorting on that rail, but at least you'll know where to look.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ve always heard itâ€™s not a choice once the bond is broken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sadly it seems like repasting laptops unless using liquid metal doesnâ€™t matter too much.,i used a couple different pastes and it didnâ€™t make much a difference,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what do you mean what problem are you trying to diagnose?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
exactly that what i was thinking its very rare failure to happen and the chipset doesn't look fried or broken and since everything in the board is working then how can this be the problem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am shocked that the problem is this chipset i have been using many laptops for years and i have never faced a problem with this chipset cause by hdmi or whatever,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the weird thing is two or three days before this issue the bios updated itself without me knowing 
should i clean the fans put another thermal paste and flash the bios ?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i was thinking the same the problem might be from a resistor , capacitor or mosfet",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
exactly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
may be they all were bad to start with?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why did they decide to pull the fan off and look at the chip for problems?,overheating?,random crashes?,absolutely fails to post?,information often helps more than pictures when looking for problems with silicon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"high temps atleast, look at that fan and paste",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
computer chips can look totally fine while being completely broken.,so how did this guy determine it was the chipset?,did he check any other potential failure modes?,have you checked any others?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hmm that seems like it could be the issue then, yeah you would need to update the bios, most likely the way i said although you can try the asus recovery method.",do you have a chip flasher by chance?,"thatâ€™s why iâ€™d still say take it to a trusted repair shop and tell them exactly what you want done, they will more than likely do it for you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
he was like when i turn on the laptop it heats up from this side the side where the chip is located so idk how he determined this is the problem not the fan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i will try my best solving the problem since i have couple of things in my hands 
thanks a lot",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s a crap amateur diagnostic explanation for someone who doesnâ€™t understand how to troubleshoot or diagnose boards.,theyâ€™re probably just guessing at components they can swap or just telling you something they canâ€™t replace.,you would need a schematic for the tuf f15 fx506h and someone who knows what theyâ€™re doing to actually diagnose the problem.,"unless someone has the skill and tools to diagnose and repair a board, itâ€™s not worth it to them.",did they say they could fix it?,is the chipset even a socketed chip you can remove or would they remove and solder a new one?,a replacement board can be found on ebay.,itâ€™s highly unlikely for a chip like that to fail without some outside component having failed first to cause damage to it.,"if anything, there could be a stress fractured solder joint and the chip is fine.","for the record, i couldnâ€™t repair this either and would just swap the entire board.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wait so the laptop does turn on?,i thought you said that it didn't.,"clearly this is a cooling problem, no?","i mean, that fan in your picture is pretty dusty and i imagine the heatsink is similar.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">he was like when i turn on the laptop it heats up from this side the side where the chip is located

probably bad cap or mosfet, but unless you know what you're doing not worth trying to fix.",replace the whole board or buy a new laptop.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™d you still need help with it, you can dm me.",i use to do it repair.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no worries bro, hope you can fix it!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> thatâ€™s a crap amateur diagnostic explanation for someone who doesnâ€™t understand how to troubleshoot or diagnose boards.,"or, weâ€™re getting opâ€™s poorly interpreted version of it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"he said he can fix it but it costs 267 dollar 
which didn't make sense to me he said the chip cost 161 dollars and the rest is his work cost and then i found out the chip is only 57 dollars",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sorry i think i didn't explain it in the right way my bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i meant trying to turn on like the screen is black no bios starting neither keyboard lights or anything just it heat up at that place,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks a lot mate i will contact you if i faced anything,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks mate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't listen to this dude.,you already found evidence of him trying to get more out of you.,run,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
does the fan spin at all?,how hot is it getting in that area?,can you narrow it down to a particular component that's getting hot?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you can set a low max temp in the bios.,i've set mine at 90â°c.,when the cpu reaches this temp it will throttle/downclock.,if you want the cpu in general to output less heat you can set the short and long term power targets lower to something your cooler can dissipate.,"my 13700k runs very efficiently in games, around 50â°c.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have a 13900k 
have just kept it stock as it does still boost significant higher than i need it to go and still hits 38000 in cinebench 
running a 280mm ekwb aio with tg contact frame which keeps it â€œtameâ€ at 90*c or so with an all core workload
still hotter than i would like but should be tamed a bit more since iâ€™m going full custom waterloop in the next month or so
overall, itâ€™s a hot chip, but my god is it fast
and yea, itâ€™s able to be cooled as long as you donâ€™t pump 1.4v into it with an all core workload",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"you dont need a expensive board, cradenz is talking out his ass.","i wouldnt even care about getting a z790 board, just get a b660/z690 with bios flashback and be happy.",you can commonly find something like the z690 pro-a ddr4 from msi for $140.,i also wouldnt care about ddr5 if i were you.,you're just talking $500 for a ddr5 ram/mobo combo vs $200 for the same thing in ddr4 capacity wise.,for less than 10% more performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wanted to go for ddr5 since i won't be touching that base for 5+ years so i wanted to go for ddr5 now.,if a z690 can do that as well then no problem.,ekwb has pretty good mainboard + waterblock combos rn like this [msi mag z690 torpedo](https://www.ekwb.com/shop/ek-mana-msi-mag-z690-torpedo-ek-x-d-rgb) for 300 total (of which the waterblock is 190 already).,is that a good option if i also want to go for ddr5-6400?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

flip the front ones and the bottom to intake for better results,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
certainly not the lowest.,air needs a path through.,a setup like this will just suck air from the nearest crack instead of sucking from the other side of the case/intake,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can't just use that case as the baseline.,certainly no point setting the o11 like that anyway,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
flip the 3 vertical ones as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
correct :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the aio in the front of the case blowing inside while cooling the gpu will transfer approximately the same amount of heat inside the case as a regular air cooled gpu.,the basic physics still apply.,edit.,"if you want to dump the most heat directly out the case, the best configuration would be to have the gpu aio at the top blowing out and the cpu aio in the front blowing in.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i don't usually shop on black friday but there are some genuine deals out there, unlike what some of the other comments are saying.",on black friday 2019 i bought a brand-new logitech g29 + shifter for â£150 all in.,that was a true black friday deal.,one i've noticed now is the dell aw3821dw - never seen this panel go that cheap before.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
some of the better deals for things are before black friday.,these days black friday sales are really over rated random sales throughout the year can most of the times beat or get very close and make it hardly worth waiting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i just got a 4 tb sn850x for â£319, when has there been a better deal?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whatâ€™s even the point in black friday haha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
max gaming has some insane deals on some mice like the g pro super light at 79. but black friday is definitely over rated these days but it's never been amazing for pc gear in the first place.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"true, its basically clearing out old shit and making people feel like they got a deal when in reality they saved bugger all",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"unlike all of the other 13th gen models, the 13100 is no different than the 12100. it's still alder lake silicon, is still 4 core, still 12mb cache, it's basically just 100mhz faster (or 3%).","so, there's zero reason to wait for the 13100. the 13400 is a different story, which will essentially be a clocked-down 12600k.",only the 13600k and higher use proper raptor lake silicon with the improvements you've read about.,"the 13400-13600 are tweaked alder lake cores, but all much faster than the model they replace.","the 13100 is, as mentioned, basically carried over.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
waiting is pointless.,the 13100 is just a rebadged 12100.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the i3 13100 isn't worth waiting for since it's just a refresh of the 12100 with a minor clock increase and is what the i3 10105 was to the i3 10100.

it's rumored to support ecc... which is a major improvement and def worth waiting for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rumored to have ecc support - which is huge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
according to [rumors](https://videocardz.com/newz/intel-to-launch-13th-gen-core-non-k-cpus-and-b760-motherboards-on-january-3rd-2023) it's using the alderlake h0 die.,"so, it therefore shouldnt have the improved memory controller or improved power.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you really think thereâ€™s a huge market to pairing the 13100 with w680 motherboards?,"at any rate, if you manage to locate a 12100e, that has ecc support.","but as with all alder lake / raptor lake models, not with consumer 600/700 series chipsets.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
right.,"although itâ€™s just rumors (from a chart that has so far proven accurate), the 13100 is expected to use the h0 stepping which is the 6+0 die used in alder lake 12100-12600. while the 13400-13600 will be the c0 die, which is the 8+8 die used in the 12600k and up (and yes, sometimes binned to lower models as well).","if thatâ€™s true, and they are both the exact same steppings as on alder lake, then i would not expect any of the raptor lake specific improvements (power efficiency, increased cache, improved memory controller) in anything below a 13600k.","unless intel starts randomly binning b0 lower, like the c0/h0 situation, and silicon lottery takes on an even greater meaning.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh i'm aware.,but not having to buy a xeon in order to put together microserver/nas builds will be hugely beneficial.,the self-hosting scene is exploding and this is a step in the right direction.,we just need more manufacturers to get on board with mini-itx wx60 motherboards with built in ipmi for the diy nas builders.,right now the best you can get in miniitx is asrock rack 8th gen with chipset c246.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just realized you mention self-hosting.,"yeah, thatâ€™s probably a good idea for that.",will be interesting to see the pricing of the 13400 and 13500 for more demanding needs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
definitely not a waste of time!!,i've been having the same exact issue but didn't think there was anything i could do.,much appreciated!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd recomend using process lasso if you don't want to change the affinity every time.,"personally, i'd set custom affinitys for any non-windows program.","i have a ryzen 7 cpu and i do, i think there's even more reason to with the new intel chips.","i put background stuff like spotify, discord, glasswire, to all run on one core.",games get all the other cores.,chrome gets a couple of cores so it runs quick but doesn't hog everything.,there's so much tweaking you can do depending on your preferences.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"when the game stalls and you look at task manager, what's consuming the cpu activity?",what does the storage activity look like?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my guess (and it is just a guess), is that that is an assassins creed odyssey problem and not a hw or windows problem.",i.e.,"the game itself or its drm gets confused, by being locked out from some cores or how its view of the processor looks with those affinity options.","performance-wise there should be nothing in hw or sw (of the drivers / os) that explains such a hang, that just affects this single game.",it would be an extremely low chance of that happening.,"&#x200b;

might be interesting to see what happens if you'd prevent the game from using the e-cores by other means (such as limiting cores to p-cores by msconfig limit, disabling them in bios, or using intels bios/scroll-lock-key legacy game compatibility option, if you have that)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i used to have a similar problem and the cause was the  windows wallpaper changer.,i had it set up every one hour.,and every hour my games would freeze for a few seconds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"e stands for excellent, whereas p is obviously poo poo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for your suggestions.,"i didnâ€™t want to make my post even longer than it already was, but iâ€™d actually already downloaded lasso and set it up to make the affinity settings for me when i run the game.",but i hadnâ€™t thought of doing the other things you mentioned to keep my games always able to get the lionâ€™s share of the machineâ€™s resources.,"i love to tinker, so iâ€™ll definitely experiment with this kind of stuff!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"storage definitely came to mind, but if this fixed it it's probably not that.","definitely worth looking at cpu usage when hitches happen, something is probably slamming all the cores for a second.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m actually interested enough to try disabling the e cores entirely just to see what the impact on the game would be.,"if i do that, i promise to report back here with the results.",i had read a while back that the hybrid chips were running afoul of some gamesâ€™ drm possibly due to the drm incorrectly seeing the p and e cores as separate cpuâ€™s entirely and preventing the game from running due to a licensing â€œviolationâ€.,i think i remember reading that ac odysseyâ€™s successor game â€œvalhallaâ€ was possibly affected in this way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sorry - kind of overlooked where i was posting i guess.,over-explaining is a thing i do sometimes.,working on it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just don't set your game launcher, like steam, to only have a core or 2 unless you want to check every time you launch a new game.",some games will inherit the core affinity from steam.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no way!,?,seriously 4% already of what exactly?,i mean this is big like game sys reqs need to start including arc big.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m a little surprised considering itâ€™s a newly introduced product.,"itâ€™s a bit unclear if these numbers are taking into account the a350, a380, a750 & a770 in laptops.","i can say anecdotally, it seems to line up with the a770 16gb frequently being out of stock at major retailers and the amount of posts on reddit of peopling showing off their arc purchases.",seems like mooreâ€™s law is dead (mlid) youtuber will have to eat his words with his videos about arc being cancelled.,as long as customers have rebar capable system and stock with dx12 & vulcan it is actually a pretty good product.,it works great with warzone 2 & cyberpunk for me at 1440p with maxed settings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for 1080p which is what the majority of gamers use, the arc gpu's are good and cheap.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"arc hasn't even been out for a year, this is pretty impressive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i've used both intel and amd processors in the past, and exclusively nvidia gpu and i'm super duper excited to see what intel can do with their new gpu's going forward.",i love competition because it usually makes everyone step up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to me it seems like an amazing result!,or rather very poor on amd's side.,especially rx 6600 at those prices should have been selling like hot cakes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so, if i'm reading the graphs correctly, they had 5% in q2 '22?",how did that happen?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
imo this is less about being super impressive for intel and more an indictment of how badly amd sells despite significantly undercutting the price of nvidia.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that is super impressive if true, also surprising to see radeon numbers considering how popular radeon gpus in reddit and tech circles, i thought they had like 30 or 40%",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that actually sounds mighty impressive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
let's not kid ourselves.,"most of these are crappy a380s in cheap laptops, not 750s and higher.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what's the point of this 4%?,"at the moment it seems to me it will get better, but for a long time only one shop in germany had intel arc gpus.","let''s talk about marketshare again, when i can visit any shop and have a choice between the 3.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
steam hardware survey doesn't list intel gpus?,https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pretty sure most of those shipped dgpus are going to pre-builds by the typical intel partners.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hmm unless they really step up their driver hame i feel like they'll lose it pretty quick,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"mild will be crying, 4% for this years gpu sales is great.","keep it up intel, looking forward to battlemage.",edit: retained 4%,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>seriously 4% already of what exactly?,"intel arc was 4% of dgpus shipped in q3 2022

amd 8%

nvidia had the rest.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's misleading.,"arc doesn't have a 4% marketshare, but accounts for 4% of all gpu shipments/purchases this year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they count even integrated gpu or something like this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mlid is full of shit and always has been,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel has 4% of total gpu shipped in q3 2022. there, fixed for you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can confirm that arc is selling well in france since retailers are out of stock especially with the mw2 offer.,i bought one myself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it just seems miss priced tbh with the current fall of gpus why buy an a770 when you can get a 6700xt at least in the states.,maybe it's pricing is much more competitive in other regions.,or people are just jumping on the band wagon?,i believe the numbers in this article are counted when the gpus are bought by retailers and not sold so maybe there is a large influx of a770m and a750m on laptops.,which would make sense since intel does very well in the laptop space.,i would assume it's also counting the 300 series arc gpus.,but being 4% already is quite impressive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
even for 1440p the a770 is a really good deal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also oos all the time too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"amd has the reputation of having awful drivers, although i'm not even sure if that's too true nowadays.","nvidia drivers have definitely gone a lot worse over the years, so it's not like drivers should be deciding factor.",i guess a lot of it is just marketing.,"you see rtx everywhere, while it seems like amd gpus don't even exist.",i hope this gen will make a difference with the ridiculous nvidia pricing.,"4090 sells, but 4080 doesn't.","and amd will be beating 4080 while being at more reasonable price point, unless something drastic happens (like 4080 getting a massive price cut).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"rather, amd doesn't care about the dgpu market because no matter what they do, people still buy nvidia so they focus their volumes on consoles.",intel is actively trying to get into the dgpu market because they do have the mindshare of nvidia that's why more shipments.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to be fair, this is just last quarter, and this is just dgpus that were shipped.","amd is the only one yet to launch their new line of gpus...so this is an inaccurate extrapolate and, quite frankly, stupid.","of the total of cards shipped, amd decreased, and intel and nvidia increased by grabbing what amd lost.","it's basically a ""no shit, that's how math works"" moment.","because amd is the only one of the 3 without a new launch, and nvidia is still shipping their oversupply of ampere.",this will paint a very different picture for q4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it will from next month, it is listing all the intel integrated gpus which is 9.1% of steam marketshare",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you have any links for prebuilds with arc gpus?,i canâ€™t find any.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
average pcmr echo chamber delusion.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's not at all what this is saying.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
claibait university called and intel has 50% as many shipment as amd.,infinite yoy%.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when amd accounted for only 8% of the purchases during the same period.,that is still a phenomenal achievement for intel in less than a year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's still pretty big tbf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's actually only looking at what each of them shipped in the last quarter.,"intel launched in what, august?",meanwhile nvidia has huge overstock and amd probably doesn't plus they're getting ready for a new launch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" no if it were integrated gpu, intel would have something like 60% of all gpus shipped.",they sell a lot of laptops with just a cpu and igpu.,not to mention server/nas machines that do not need dedicated gpu driving the displays.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if his past predictions were on the money, intel would have been already went the kodak way while nvidia would struggle to beat amd's 200w gpus with their 600w gpus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s pure amd fan fiction at this point.,iâ€™m not sure how much he actually gets as â€œleaksâ€ either.,heâ€™ll just delete old videos that were way off the mark so itâ€™s hard to tell his track record.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, iâ€™m very happy with its performance on mwii multi player and warzone.",mwii multiplayer i consistently get 75fps+ in 1440p at max settings.,for warzone itâ€™s about 70fps at 1440p in max settings.,both of these are using xess.,cyberpunk iâ€™m not sure how to judge it.,with everything maxed at 1440p with ray tracing set to high i get 32-35fps.,iâ€™ve never tried it without the high ray tracing setting.,it looks amazing but the frame rate is pretty low as a consequence.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on what you want to do with it.,"6700xtâ€™s raytracing and encoding performance are pretty subpar, even compared to arc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"meh i think the buying has died down, they better fix the drivers",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
will respond with my new a770 then.,participating to the rise of arc share.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"interestingly, xe graphics are only .01% behind intel uhd when sorting for windows-only systems, indicating a lot of people are buying xe-supported laptops and installing steam on them.","there's almost 0.5% more xe users on steam then vega8, an igpu that's been used since raven ridge launched in late 2017.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm not trying to say it's not a great outlook.,it is.,and i want intel to succeed in this space.,i'm simply clarifying the title.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s not so much a a big achievement by intel as much as amd is just absolutely pathetic outside of the diy builder enthusiast echo chamber.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this does include gaming laptops with discrete gpus though.,"assuming a total shipment of ~50 million dgpus for 2022 and assuming arc maintains the same cadence, they'll have 2% of shipments for the year and less than 1% since ampere launched.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"lets see where his investments have been and see if they have been influencing his ""leaks""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
both him and adored are basically fanfiction writers for amd fanboys.,i still remember october 2020 when he made a blatant claim that nvidia was planning to flood the market with 3080s in december and it was an artificial supply constraint.,when that didn't happen he deleted that video.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unfortunately itâ€™s the driver inconsistency.,this will more than likely be fixed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am all the more impressed that intel got that result relative to amd already.,allthough amds new gpus are not launched yet so that would probably explain it a bit.,this might actually be the best time for intel to compare the sells lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel has a huge leverage on the oem market, so i assume it comes from that.",rarely see radeon dgpus in prebuilt/laptops.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i don't really plan on ocing, is it still better?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they're really similar tbh but the 13600kf is newer and will perform a bit better in most games.,i mentioned ram not because of overclocking but that 13th gen cpus support faster ram speeds out of the box compared to 12th gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you aren't overclocking then go 12700 but max ram speed you should realistically expect is 3500mts or 1750mhz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"while your cpu will be ok, i think it would be in your best interest to upgrade your cooler.",the 12400f isnâ€™t that hard of a chip to cool.,"and again, high temperatures isnâ€™t an issue like your cpu isnâ€™t going to be hurt.",that temp is honestly over my comfort zone.,if your ok with it and the noise then keep it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"god damn, rendering with an i5 did that?",is it an oem cooler?,you use cooler paste?,wouldnâ€™t your gpu taken up the load?,or do you use on-board graphics?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have the same cpu and its normal when you maxed out the cpu usage usually goes around 90+â°c

"thanks, i will look for another cooler but i will continue editing until i can buy one.",thanks again for the response.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, it's the stock cooler and i used the thermal paste that came with the cooler but i don't know why premiere is using more cpu than gpu.",as i understand i'm using hardware rendering and that means that it's using the gpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks, i will try to get a new cooler",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you bought an f sku.,this cpu does not have onboard graphics.,it will accelerate what it can with the gpu but the cpu still has to tell that gpu wtf it is doing and that will load ur cpu.,the temps are a bit warm for what id like personally but are within safe bounds.,cheap replacement would be hyper 212 evo or whatever derivation is out these days.,"the best air cooler you could probably get would be the noctua nh-u12a or the d15, but either would be way overkill for that chip.","far as aio's, anything 240mm or 360mm will be fine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
definitely would explore a big dog cpu cooler.,like a big ass coolermaster or thermaltaie unless you can afford water cooling unit.,"stock cooler is not ideal, but damn that is pretty toasty.",but separate hardware gpu being present and engaged seems odd.,might check the settings and see if adobe has any boxes not checked properly.,cpu should almost be ideal unless you told it to share the load or use both.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
worth it?,"no, not really.","but if you're asking the question, you're probably going to get it anyways",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you need it?,probably not.,"but if you have $600 to burn, itâ€™s a pretty easy upgrade.",you might not even notice the difference though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"keep in mind if you get a 13th gen cpu and a z690 itâ€™s almost a guarantee that the board will need a bios update in order for the cpu to work, so if you are dead set on z690 you will either need a 12th gen cpu to use while you update your bios then cpu swap or get a board that has the bios flashing feature where no cpu is needed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'm using the corsair h170i elite lcd (420mm aio) and it will still reach 100c on all core but thats mostly because the motherboards default to unlimited settings that let the cpu run that high.,"if you limit it to the 253watt that the chip is spec'd to, it will be around 60c-80c.","now even with unlimited, my h170i is 38c idle, 60c under most usage, and 100c all cores blasting full throttle at 5.4 (p) and 4.3 (e).","honestly nothing is going to cool this chip when it's left to run wild on unlimited wattage defaults in the bios :)

but you can let the chip hit 100c and it will manage itself up to 100c.","if you limit the chip to the spec 253 watt limit, then it will throttle before it hits 253 watts and stay reasonably cool but it will throttle sooner and keep itself from getting too hot.",take your pick.,this thing is a wild horse :) it's fast.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
arctic liquid freezer ii 360 does very well on mine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
get yourself a 360mm aio and make sure your board isnâ€™t letting your cpu go bonkers on power draw.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a 360 or 420mm aio would probably be a good choice, also check your power draw, i've got the same board but a 13600kf and that draws over 220w sometimes so i'd imagine your power draw is crazy high",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you need either a 360 or 420 aio in order to stand a chance.,i have an alphacool eisbaer 360 on my i9 12900k.,"what i like about it is that the radiator is made from pure copper, not the copper-aluminium alloy most oems use.",that means it moves heat far more effective.,"my workload is not unlike the one you have, but my cpu never hits above 60 degrees celsius.","granted, it doesn't draw as much power as a 13th gen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

most accurate response.,"this chip is unique in that you, not the manufacturer, decide which temp(wattage) you want to run at.","otherwise, balls to the wall.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to be a bit more realistic: of course you can cool 300 watt of power dissipation, that's not that much.",a modern gpu can go to 700watt and they are air cooled.,"the actual problem is that the vast majority of coolers are designed for something like 150 watt, they use a couple heat pipes to a air cooler or a tiny pump to a huge radiator.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for the answer!,will take my time to decide what cooling solution to choose.,for the moment i limited the power to 253 watts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you have the 253 watts limitation on?,what temperatures you get on full load?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's horrible .. it uses a tiny baby pump that barely manages to cool 100watt, not to speak about 250-300.  
it comes with a radiator that could cool 1000 watt and doesn't get more than warm because of the low flow rates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for the answer!,limited the power draw to 253 watts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if i leave it unlimited it goes beyond 300 watts.,"wonder where it would stop if you can keep it really cool, i guess using custom cooling with liquid nitrogen would tame this cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for the answer!,i have limited the power draw to 253 watts and will upgrade the cooling soon.,"so far it performs relatively the same, but with lower temperatures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great suggestion!,will do that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with any af  aio you can call it a minute.,they have pumps designed for 100watt continuous power usage combined with radiators good for a whole apartment heating solution.,but on the bright side: they have lots of leds instead of a proper pump.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah it's a wild chip.,it took me sometime to realize that it wasn't plug n play like your usual chip.,this one wants to run as wild as you will let it.,a lot of that has to do with the motherboards encouraging unlimited pl1 pl2 settings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

mine does not go higher than 35000 in cinebench r23 with temperatures sitting around 83â°c.,do not understand the low score in cinebench though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have no doubt that steve from gamers nexus is aware of that, he is one of the few non idiot reviewers out there.",but he is comparing available coolers and most coolers are as horrible as the af2's or worse due to bad mounting or even worse pumps.,"that video was 2 years ago, so afaik there are 2 or 3 with significantly better pumps out now.",just look at the tiny size of the pump of the af2's.,the only thing that transports pumps from the cooling block to the radiator is the micro-pump.,"and on top, the cooling block is pure copper but it's very light, it has barely any thermal storage capacity (copper is expensive) which adds up, more metal in that area would permit the micro pump solution to be a bit better in spiked loads.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"they're both same family, but 12400 has 100 mhz higher clock (4.4ghz vs 4.3ghz, all cpus use turbo boosting) and sports much denser cache (18 mb against 12 mb), so there is some easily measurable advantage for the i5, but it's not an exquisite one.","i'd also imagine you'll be dealing with encoding/decoding and compression/decompression apart from raw audio treatment, so go for i5 anyway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yup your right, 12400 has 6 cores, 12100 has 4 cores.",if you can make use of the extra cores 12400 will be up to 1.5x faster.,so like encoding a file to mp3 is a pretty good example of when all the cores can be used and performance scales with core count.,"in that case 12400 will be noticeably faster than 12100.  

but if your talking about single core or light workloads the difference will be difference in max turbo speeds so like a few hundred mhz.",that wonâ€™t be noticeable unless your running benchmarks and getting scores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you two seem to know what your talking about with ram.,probably my biggest grey area.,so what sort of fps increase would i be expecting if i upgraded to a z790 ddr5 msi motherboard and got the g.skill trident z5 rgb series (intel xmp) 32gb (2 x 16gb) 288-pin sdram ddr5 6400 cl32-39-39-102 1.40v dual channel.,from my old z690 msi board with corsair vengeance rgb pro 32gb (2 x 16gb) ddr4 3600mhz c18.,it would only cost me an extra â£200 as i am buying a new motherboard regardless and they are similar in price from ddr4/ddr5.,so i would just be paying for the new ram and i would be able to sell my old ram.,worth??,?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at 1080p ddr5 6400 with cl32 is about 8-10fps depending on game over 3600 ddr 4 is it worth?,only you can answer that.,thatâ€™s talking about the g skill kit against the corsair ddr4 kit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hmmm thank you, don't know if â£200 for an extra 10fps is worth it to me providing the new cpu takes me to a almost 300.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's perfectly fine.,some people can justify it some people can't.,i mean it is a minor performance increase and not as major as say a cpu upgrade or a gpu upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have the 240mm h100i lcd.,my 13900kf hits up to 80-84c but averages around mid 70s when gaming.,i think it's normal and also depends on your settings and ambient temps.,i have mce off in my bios and run it at 1.37v,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
check voltages and power draw while gaming.,"if package power is something like 200-240w while playing mw2 or bf2042 then yes, you would expect a temp of 82c with a 360mm aio.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"check the cpu usage as those games will use 8 cores and 16 threads on a cpu or at least battlefield will, mw2 is a cpu hog as well and this will explain why the cpu is ruining hot because of the high usage",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"problem might be bf 2042 , when iâ€™m playing mw2 it sits at 60c , also saw some post in @battlefield forum regarding high usage of cpu .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have seen it spike to high 70s but most of the time it sits at a more reasonable temp.,"i would have to check it but i am sure it is usually 60-65

just had a quick game as it the first time i ever played it.",it actually only hits 55c max for me in game.,same for 2042,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

someone correct me if i'm wrong but i think vcore is the more accurate reading?,my p-core vids on my 13900kf show a lower voltage than the vcore.,vcore being what i have my voltage manually set to.,but to answer your question i think that's fine.,i'm running my 13900kf at 1.37 (otherwise it's unstable in cinebench at least) and temps are decent for my use case of gaming.,so i think as long as your temps are ok then it's fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i would argue not as much as people make it out to be.,seems the same reason why people want slighly faster ram that gives 10% more fps for 50%\~ more cost.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've asked about dram a few times now and so far no one could explain the difference it would make for me.,my only problem with my ssd is my os is on it and if i update a game that's also on that ssd my pc becomes ultra slow until it's done.,"i have a dramless ssd, so far no one could tell me if having dram would help with this",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
some would recommend a faster nvme drive for the main os drive then one of these ssds as a secondary / storage drive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah idk.,if i had an nvme it would just do the updating faster but i bet my remaining savings my pc would still be unusable until it's done.,if the game is on my hdd then sure the udpating takes a bit longer but my pc remains usable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah you need a z690 or z790 1700 socket,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you need a new motherboard
12th and 13th gen use lga1700
10th and 11th use lga1200
so there are 500 more pins in the new socket 
also, the new 12th and 13th gen chips are significantly larger and would not physically fit into a z590 or z490 board

quicksync (and hardware encoders generally) don't compress as well but they're more computation efficient.,if you need high quality in a small file size you should use a software encoder.,if you don't mind a larger file size but need low cpu use (for example live streaming) you'd probably use a hardware encoder.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"do you mean ""quick sync"" ?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looks like the main text of my original post didn't make it on the opening post.,i was doing some experiments to figure out best setting for combined speed of decoding & encoding videos for use on my phone.,i have many videos i already put on my phone but was experimenting to achieve smaller video files without loss of quality & also to improve speed of transcoding.,i was using quicksync as on my old core i9 9900k i would get frequent crashes when using pure software so that was what i also used on my core i7 11700k but i couldn't help to think i could do better as i watched the cpu& gpu usage i felt that there was plenty of performance left on the table that wasn't being utilized & as a result i started to experiment with different encoder speed settings & trying software decoding as well as encoding.,my settings when i started were as follows.,quicksync active for decoding only.,h.265 10bit encoding as i was transcoding uhd blu-ray movies.,"main 10 encoder profile

output frame rate to same as source

advanced option for avx512 operation during trancoding.","encoder speed preset to fast

no filters

1080p30 modified preset

with these settings i was averaging depending  on movie 32 to 35 frames per second transcoding.",when i changed encoder speed preset to ultrafast still with quicksync decoder active the output frame rate climbed to 38 to 40 frames per second.,when i turned off the quicksync decoder my average frame rate jumped to almost 50 frames per second.,file size for planet earth 2 disk 1 was 3.25 gb on original settings.,going to ultrafast encoder preset setting reduced file sized to 2.5 gb.,this was unexpected as i was expecting the slower settings to offer smaller file sizes for same qualily output settings but opposite was true.,"sizes of file was unchanged when i turned off quicksink wit ultrafast setting

watching said video even on my 32 inch 4k hdr monitor looked very close to original at these settings.","as a result i am very happy camper

i currently have a 1 tb microsd card in my phone with over 260 movies on it.",of those 42 are uhd blu-ray shrinks.,the rest are standard blu-ray & dvd shrinks.,i wanted to fit as many as possible on my phone without losing significant quality.,i would say i have accomplished that in spades & i still have over 600gb free to put more on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is that a question or a statement?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i'm using a d15 and it have ram clearance issues, mainly caused by the frontal fan.","i removed that fan and placed it on the frontal intake, so the cooler is basically a d15s.",it did not hurt my thermal performance by a lot.,"with this configuration i can do 200+w with 80-85 degrees, and hitting 100 degrees at 280-300w.",(room temperature is kept at around 20-25 degrees so the performance may be lower for singapore).,"i would suggest d15s if you are worrying about ram clearance, and d15 if you are not.",u12a is a little marginal for 13600k and may not be much cheaper.,"ak620 and fuma 2 should both be sufficient for 13600k, they are cheaper but may be a little noisy, especially for fuma 2 (i have used their 120mm fans in the same case as exhaust, and that fan is significantly noisier than the noctua fans, especially at 1000-1500 rpm).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'd go with thermalright's peerless assassin instead, it offers similar performance as both coolers but is much quieter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thermalright frost commander 140 is another good choice.,then again you can get away with way worse coolers if you bother to undervolt and/or lower power limits with minimal performance losses.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the ak620 not only performs better than the d15, it's also cheaper by a lot.",i see no reason to stick to noctua.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
has deepcool already promised adapters for the lga 1851 ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nh-u12a works great on my 12700k and i will use it when i change to a 13700k down the road also, a very important point vs which of those coolers to use is a: the case and how good of airflow it has.",b: that you verify that said cooler will clear your ram.,"&#x200b;

i have a fd torrent case and a asus z690 hero board, i changed my order on memory due to hard to get ddr5 at the time i was ordering and got corsair rgb memory, just due to availability and i got lucky it just barely clears the ram, the non rgb sticks would have been easy fit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the conclusion i'm getting is the deepcool ak620 & thermalright peerless assassin 120 are 2 of the most mentioned non-noctua cpu air coolers for the i5 13600k in the comment section.,interesting observation.,come and share your thoughts why.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the ak620 is a great cooler, but i'll note that new stock for the noctua coolers should include the lga1700 bracket in the box, so requesting the free kit shouldn't be necessary now.",they've been bundling them for at least the last six months.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my d15s came with lga1700 hardware, dont blame noctua for vendors selling old stock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"soz vossky, but you didn't do enough research.","you have to read a few reviews, and check every so often for new reviews before making these claims.","i have had several noctua coolers, and fans, and like them well enough, but the d15 was dethroned years ago.",noctua has new d15 coming because it's been beaten in many reviews.,"it's well known that the dc assassin 3 is at the bare minimum as good as good as the d15, and up to 3 degrees cooler depending on the review.","lemacho grand also was in the same ball park, and the darkrock pro 4 is also right there.","i'm not sure about the thermalright fc140, but it's supposed to be as good, and has been on sale for $44 at amazon.","even if it's 3 degree's worse, it's less than half the price of a new d15.","that dc ak620 is within 3 degrees of the d15, but also noticeably less money.","i will recommend any of those, especially on sale, as a competitor, or better buy than the d15.","with noctua you are paying for the name, quality control/warranty, support, and fans that generally better than the competitors.","worth it vs some coolers, but probably not worth 30%-50%+ money.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

some boards come with lga 1200 holes.,the bracket kit is free i believe from noctua or 15$(cad) from newegg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just bought an ak620 off amazon and it was one of the inventory that didnâ€™t come with the bracket.,contacted support and they verified shipment within a few hours.. wonâ€™t have it till next week.,iâ€™m in america though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is the thermalright bracket a must for the lga 1700 socket?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"could you specify what continuous power draw you were ""fully loading"" the system under?",its rated 125w/160w power limits?,or uncapped?,i was using a thermalright pa120 and at the uncapped 200w it was pushing 92c.,at 160w it was a much more reasonable 75-80c as you noted.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
agreed.,i have the fuma 2 rev b on my 12600k and it works just as well as the 240mm aio i replaced.,the idle temp is even a few degrees lower with the fuma.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it can draw power if you really want to crank it up, but honestly the performance gains are marginal and for 95% of people a d15 is absolutely plenty.","typically i like to go aio simply because i like to overclock, but i understand that it's not entirely reasonable lol.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah?,"white fans were coming in 2020, and now theyâ€™re q3 2023. if theyâ€™re having that much trouble with the color white, iâ€™m not putting much hope in a entirely new d15 replacement coming on time in q1 2023, especially since the new 140mm fan itâ€™s supposed to use was supposed to be out now andâ€¦ isnâ€™t.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

but why bother with that when you can get an equally good product at lower price and without this chore?,the very fact that you have to ask for an adapter for a platform that is out for well over a year is ridiculous.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to be honest i haven't tried the 13600k without it, but at the price and considering the ease of mounting there is really no reason to skip it.",watch the gamers nexus video about it if undecided!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to be honest i haven't checked the power draw as it runs stock with all cores at the rated clock speeds.,how and why it draws 200w when maintaining stock speed?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
overclocking is just pointless nowadays.,chips are so good at maximizing their efficiency and clocks.,"you gain a few % performance for much more power draw (including need more cooling), instability and much time spent tinkering.","so, unless you're trying to break some records, the d15 will do absolutely fine for any i5 and probably higher as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no aggressive overclock on my i7 4790k when i first got it and still have not 8 years later.,"paired it with a corsair h100i, still working in 2022. only thing i did was a mild factory oc via oc genie on the msi z97 gaming 5 mobo.",this haswell cpu is still a beast 8 years on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

didnâ€™t install it right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
use more paste so you can see it dripping on the desk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"pea size, not frosting a cake.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
use same force on every screw to se better results,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why so much termal paste?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you forgot some thermal paste in the center,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you used the whole tube of paste?,ðÿ˜‚,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the verge installs a contact frame.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
make sure you tighten down your screws in criss cross formation..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thats not enough paste, use more!!",!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
installed poorly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
use a star pattern when tightening the plate down and your cooler down.,there's uneven torque on the screws which is why this is happening.,just count how many times you turn your screw driver and try to tighten it as consistently as possible if you want the most accurate measurements.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the frame helped my 12900k quite a bit.,"freshly installing a cooler gave me good temps initially, but after giving it a few hours to settle and the warping did its thing, and my temps went up by as much as 10 degrees.",this was repeatable.,using the contact frame meant that my temps remain solid after installation.,i've not touched my cooler in months.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looks like typical case of user error when it comes to tightening the screws.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i bet your temps are utterly horrendous with that amount of thermal paste.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why would you post how bad you are at applying thermal paste?,way too much.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the tube of thermal paste included wasn't a suggested serving size ðÿ˜³,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the only issue is the amount of paste used, you can see the gaps of the cpu being filled but there is also obviously more than needed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"with all due respect, this is the messiest, grossest thermal paste application i've seen in a while.",we should never apply this much.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

man i thought your cpu got the t virus!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looks like stuff from movie alien ðÿ¥¶,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s a lot of thermal paste.,"you know itâ€™s just supposed to fill in microscopic gaps, not act as its own layer, right?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why so much paste?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how much paste did you use?,op: yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
way too much paste.,remember anything more than fills the air gaps will actually make your cpu run hotter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"jeez, you put a lot of thermal paste on that cpu.... are you for real??",?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dude!!,holy crap how much flipping thermal paste are you using!,you could take a bath in that shit you used so much haha!,to much can cause contact and thermal issues too man.,you could use 1/5th of what you put on there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"its a new 13700k , first i had it with stock without any frame.","then after 4 days of use with stock i installed the thermarlight and temps was exactly the same but i did not expect to get so poor contact

tight the screws in diagonal with the key provided and just 2 fingers.,it worked for me.,the hardest part was to find the ideal tension on the ek-aio screws.,that was what was giving me cpu errors because of memory i/o issues.,"i have 4 dimms but it only worked well with 2. shity weak-end because of this ,,,!",[gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are missing the point of the contact frame.,while some peeps report temp drops the whole point is to stop the intel locking mechanism or ilm from apply too pressure to the chip and bending it therefore creating uneven contact.,temp drops are a bonus but thatâ€™s not the point of the contact frame.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you want to loosen the screws a little then lightly tighten each corner criss-cross until they just barely stop.,then go around and repeat to snug them up.,try to give them all around the same amount of tightening force.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
afaik aside from diag pattern.... the thermalright frame just needs.to be screwed in as far as they will go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"when you install this, you put a marker on the screws, and turn them all the same amount of times.","i do usually a quarter turn each and then another quarter turn and you should be good to go

you wonâ€™t damage anything over tightening, you just wonâ€™t post and will have to re do it, i have mine installed and it dropped 10 degrees celsius",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you need to build a small frame around the cpu (think like a hockey rink) to keep the paste from escaping out of the sides.,also use all of tube next time :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that is simply a poor installation of the cooler, nothing to do with the frame.",you tightened the top screws on the cooler too much and did not tighten the bottom tight enough.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have done this not a week ago, the screw from the factory can be taken off with just the pressure from your fingertips alone and the round torx tool, you shouldn't even need to rely on the l to apply more torque, they are finger tight.","screw them down as hard as you can by holding the tool with your fingertips, until they start to slip, then you know it's torqued well enough.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

put your build together and monitor your temps.,way too many casuals watched 1 or 2 videos online and think they absolutely need one.,then we get posts like this on the sub.,most of the time it was the cooler itself not being mounted properly or bad thermal paste installation.,with that being said this frame has helped a lot of people in some scenarios and had no impact or even made it worse for others.,i've had a 12900k since launch week and my temps are actually amazing with just a 280mm aio.,whole thing baffles me tbh.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

dont force anything and make sure you torque/tighten in a cross pattern.,just use the allen key the long way so the short end is in your hand.,give one screw a couple turns than move to opposite side turn it a few times then back up top again and repeat.,tighten in a criss cross pattern till they stop (you cant tighten anymore without using a lot of force).,then go around in a circle and just give them a slight gentle turn to make sure they're all seated (like a little umph) and that's it you're done.,"&#x200b;

p.s.",i also wouldn't worry to crazy about the contact that much on the thermal paste.,what matters the most is your cpu temps.,if your temps are really good under load than who cares what your contact looks like?,you know it has to be good because your temps are showing so.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

well are 90 to 93 at 5.6ghz all core on a noctua nh-d15s with 2 fans at 1070 rpm good temps with a rare peak of 96c and an occasional spike to 94-95c on a 13900k with e-cores off at 1.325v llc6 running cinebench r23.,"&#x200b;

and temps averaging 86-87c usually 86c running cpu-z stress test.","&#x200b;

i have researched and many say fine as these raptor lake cpus run hotter than alder lake most likely due to much increased p-core clocks and and ability to clock them much higher.","&#x200b;

though i have e-cores off.",though i imagine if i had them on i would have 0 chance to run at 5.6ghz all p core on air with all p and e-cores fully loaded without severely hitting thermal wall for what even top tier air cooling is good for.,"&#x200b;

i wonder if another part of the reason raptor lake runs a little hotter than alder is because of the additional e-cores/ and since 4 e-cores takes up the space of 1 p core, they added 8 more to 13900k compared to 12900k and thus the space of 2 additional p cores.",and maybe did they have to make each one slightly smaller on the same exact sized pcb and die and thus a little more dense thus more heat??,or was there room for an extra 2 p cores or 8 e-cores on the 12900k die without making anything smaller they just were not there unlike the 13900k?,"&#x200b;

cause i do notice even at what appears to be similar power usage of 190 watts according to pout value in hwinfo64 it does seem hotter than 5ghz all core 12700k both with e-cores off in cinebench r23.","&#x200b;

12700k at 5ghz that i had around 180 to 190 watt pout value during r23 at 1.275 llc6 vcore ran around 85 top 89c instead of the 90-93c and spikes to 95c my 13900k 5.6ghz 1.325v llc5 runs at.",both once again e-cores off.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why do you think itâ€™s â€œevilâ€?,itâ€™s a pricing model.,everybody seems to think that it will mean stuff is going to be bad and expensive but intel isnâ€™t a monopoly so regardless of the pricing model they will have to price the products so that they are competitive.,and chips already include all kinds of disabled parts.,now they just make it so that you can enable some of those afterwards.,you will still get exactly what you pay for when you buy a cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"taking another look at that link, the 13900k seems to average 4-8% ish above the 13700k, but is that very significant in real application and noticeably so?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"true, it may be, but if the 13900k would make multitasking (playing game, recording gameplay, recording face/voice all at once on a single pc setup) smoother, then i can record at higher quality (4k instead of 2k) but again, no idea if the 13900k would do that much better than the 13700k.","also in terms of render times in premiere pro, sometimes for time sensitive videos it can make all the difference shaving off a couple minutes even, but again, no idea if there's much difference between the 13700k and 13900k in these kinds of scenarios.","i do have a pretty solid nvme as is, ram i got some cheaper (corsair vengeance) ddr5 for now because even if i could afford the more expensive ddr5 ram, i think (i could be wrong) it would be better to wait till the better ddr5 ram gets fleshed out and drops in price since ddr5 is still relatively new.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it does use gpu, but even then, i heard it also utilizes the igpu as well as the cpu altogetherðÿ¤·ðÿ»â€â™‚ï¸",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's the question right there.,it depends.,"if the 900k allows me to both work in premiere pro faster (smooth timeline) and helps render times, then it can allow me to also potentially bump my videos from 2k to 4k which increases the quality and for time sensitive videos, it can be the difference of getting it out faster which sometimes can in turn make more money.","the question is, will it be much of a difference from the 700k and that i have no clue as it's hard to find such specific info.","there's also the fact of whenever i do want to record pc games, since i'm on a single pc setup i'd have to be able to play the game, record the gameplay with 1 program, and record face/voice with another program, so maybe in that scenario the 900k would have an advantage, not sure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i could get the 13900k technically, but the question is, is the difference in performance worth the extra $200 especially for what iâ€™ll be using it for?",or would i never utilize the 13900k to its potential and that it would be pointless over the 13700k even if i can afford it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,most content creation workloads have very high parallelism and can use as many cores/threads as you have available.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"their test bench uses slow ddr5, so maybe that was a factor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got a 12700k for content creation.,puget systems tested/benchmarked various processors and graphics cards.,"either cpu will be good for those tasks but of course, more cores is potentially beneficial.","if your budget can fit the extra $, go for it but pair it up with a good card - the 3060+ are good with the sweet spot appears to be 3080 - and anything higher tier.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so unfortunately i cannot answer most of that for you since i am unsure how much money you make with your content.,"however, i can tell you that for a single pc setup (i have one as well), the igpu in either one will record all your gameplay without issue or stream it without issue.",intel's quicksync is absolutely phenomenal.,"so the igpu doing one thing and the dgpu doing the other thing, you shouldn't really be using any cores for anything other than processing the game.",so the extra cores will just be for editing and rendering...of which the gpu typically handles much of the workload depending on the gpu and program being used.,good luck!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you might see some improvements but i don't think it's drastic enough for you to justify the price.,"for rendering a gpu is more important, same thing for games, i would go for the 13700k if i had to choose between the two.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

definitely.,"unless, you're getting paid lots of $ and a professional - and time is of the essence etc.",- you don't need 'overkill stuff' at this point but it's good to get a good 'middle ground' instead of needing more 'power' later.,a 13700k would be fine and a combo of 13700k/3080 10gb will be great.,"these tests might interest you:

* your dram is just not stable for some reason.","you could shuffle the sticks around, loosen timings, going down a speed bin or even go back to jedec speeds entirely.",i won't recommend you raise any voltages due to the amount of harm it may cause.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what b-die kit is running at 3600cl16?,arenâ€™t they generally cl14?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
further (and evenly!!!),tighten contact frame.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the contact frames can definitely cause issues with the cpu contact in the socket.,i'd pull it back off and do a careful crisscross tightening pattern.,turn the screws just 1/4 turn each time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't over tighten the contact frame.,too tight can cause issues.,want to stop when the pins stop bending and you touch the mainboard.,it's a sudden wall of resistance.,so not tight just snug?,tight you crush stuff.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you all for you help.,it was a mounting problem.,but i'm most certain that not from the thermaright frame.,"that thing is almost fool proof, as tested by igor labs.",and i did not over tighten it.,the ek lga 1700 frame was the culprit.,there are many  air or aio coolers that you can tight the screws till the end.,not this one.,and also i did not over tighten it ( that's what i thought ).,i had to try by trial and error the best tension.,"that's not the best approach for a cooling mounting system ....

"> they're also generally locked at a lower power limit/max clock speed than the k series variants

you are not power limited with a non-k cpu, you can still set that to whatever you want.",you're right about clocks though - the non-k cpus usually run ~200mhz slower than the k versions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are misunderstanding the difference between a manual overclock and the cpu automatically boosting to its maximum supported clock speeds.,both the k and non-k variants will automatically boost up to their rated clock speeds.,"with the k variants, the user can manually set a specific clock speed, which overrides the automatic boosting behavior.",the non-k variant will always be in auto mode with no manual control.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it still does.,that's the baseline at max power.,overclocking lets you go beyond *that*.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

232 watts is low for the 13900k.,maybe throttling a specific core (or maybe the vrm).,i work in a pc store.,"when we limit the 13900k for coolers that can't handle it, we don't really go under 250 watts, at that point you might as well get the i7.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

try updating intel management engine.,it helps on some z690 motherboards.,"also, since current / edp limit throttling is set to yes, you may want to check if you have current limitations in the bios vrm settings.",it may also help to update your bios since your voltage is quite high for 5ghz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the throttling is likely due to cooler/aio type or seating on cpu.",or mentioned ealier incorrect voltage or cpu settings in bios.,blk- 100 should be off.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intel management engine updated?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you running the same cinebench version as whatever benchmark you're using for reference and did you set the xmp profile in the bios for your ram?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
try raising the current limit from intel's default 280a to 512a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the very high scores are achieved with unlimited power.,232w is fairly conservative.,that chip can go up to ~300w.,i would just ignore it.,the situations where your performance is affected even a little by this are almost nonexistent.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is there an 85c thermal limit in the bios you can increase to 100c?,it shouldnâ€™t flatten at exactly 85c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s wild these hit 85+c with a 360mm aio.,i had to go i5 for 13th gen because iâ€™m in sff and it would just thermal throttle otherwise.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's staying at 85c because it's locked to 4.9ghz.,you'd definitely be close to 98-100c if it was at 5 8ghz stock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you only need one 8pin, the second one is usually for ln2/extreme o/c.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

okay i noticed that your max boost speed is locked to 50x hence the 4.94 ghz go into bios and set the all core to 55x to test.,check if it is on auto and change this to 55x.,"i had 2 bios available when i flashed the z690 motherboard i took the very latest one but there was another one which allowed the 13900k to run on the z690 but older do re check just in case


if you are using the intel xtu you can change the p cores there",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"12900ks owner here, installed on windows 10, performance was shit.",upgraded to windows 11 and the itâ€™s been nothing but gains and stability.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh yeah?,wow you must really know your stuff!,so thereâ€™s a thread director in windows 10 too?,no.,yeah it sucks.,it doesnâ€™t use right cores and causes high latency.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
happy to report the vr issues are fixed in win11 as of a few updates ago :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the cpu was designed to be used with windows 11. i'm pretty sure windows 10 can't even use the p cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah, makes sense, i think windows 11 would help as well as selecting unlimited power and letting the motherboard auto oc the motherboard, mine got almost 41k with xmp and mce on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is patently false.,the new scheduler which supports p and e core scheduling only exists in extremely limited form in windows 10. win10 straight up performs worse with 12th/13th gen... and the statement around security being worse is total hogwash.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
k. because all you said was they worked with it...without any tangible results...but its been proven that windows 11 is not required for 12th/13th gen to function at its peak capabilities.,i've not seen any thing to say otherwise.,"long story short, win 10 or 11 will work fine on 12th/13th, and is not the root cause of what the op is going through, besides we already know it is the power limit he has on his cpu thats preventing it from going beyond",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">you could disable the ""e"" cores in the bios, and this had the result of shifting all the on board cache to the remaining p cores.","you misunderstood that, by disabling e cores, the cache stop underclocking below e cores clock and you can push frequency higher.","on asus' boards you can disable that, but somehow on my z690-a pro cache stays at 4.4 ghz all the time, despite having e cores at 4.0 ghz.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i just ordered a 13700kf â€”- is the performance lackluster?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's technically correct, but for the wrong reason.","e-cores have no l3 of their own, only l1/l2 - they utilize the same l3 cache pool as p-cores.","with e-cores disabled, p-cores *do* functionally have unfettered access to the full l3 cache.","in practice, the difference is fairly negligible, especially on 13th gen chips (due to the relative increase in l2/l3 cache, as well as much higher e-core ring clock speed).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks, i watched a few youtube videos and saw some mixed results - some games went up a few fps, some went down.","there were comments on one of the videos saying that by disabling pcores, someone was able to push the overclock multiplier higher.","so far i've not seen anything that said it was worth the effort, with the exception of some early 12th gen adopters who had to disable e cores to get a few games to work.",i'm expecting that's not an issue by now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i had some chips-ahoy cookies which made me pretty happy, but no drugs, just researching the new cpu since the last one i had was a pretty simple 9700k without hyperthreading, e/p cores, etc..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
performance seems fine with the 13700k.,"i came from a 9700k running windows 10

upgraded mb, cpu and boot ssd.",seems a little snappier and i notice games load a little faster off the new ssd.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is technically wrong because the e-cores themselves do not consume cache.,the program consumes cache.,"disabling e-cores means the program schedules onto p-cores instead where it fights for l2, l3, and p-core time instead of just l3.",where disabling e-cores can help is dealing with games where the stable geniuses behind it decided to spawn one worker thread per physical core and the return per thread goes negative due to multiprocessing overhead.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"then be happy for having all those cores and threads at last, instead of trying to gimp your cpu...?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
performance tab -> right click on graph -> change graph to -> logical processors.,cores order just as materidan stated.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not sure if it's the best but process explorer is nice for seeing what is running on the e-cores vs. other cores.,"for example, during windows search indexing i can see the e cores get a whole bunch of activity.",app just got a big update too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
task manager is just basic.,"in resource monitor, last cores shown are e-cores, first ones are hyper-threaded pairs of p-cores.","so, for example with a 12900k / 13700k:
- cpu 0 = p-core 1, thread 1
- cpu 1 = p-core 1, theead 2
- cpu 2 = p-core 2, thread 1
- cpu 3 = p-core 2, theead 2
- â€¦
- cpu 16 = e-core 1
- â€¦
- cpu 23 = e-core 8",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this makes so much sense, now i'm trying to figure out what i would have read that made me think it was the other way around.",totally makes sense that the 'best' cores would be hyperthreaded.,and also aligns with what processexplorer is showing perfectly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you have that backwards.,"p-cores are hyperthreaded, therefore they show up as 2 cpus, while e-cores are not hyperthreaded and show up as a single cpu.",everything it says is correct.,"8 p-cores with 2 threads each = cpus 0-15, and 8 e-cores with 1 thread each = cpus 16-23.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this makes so much sense now!,"thanks for pointing this out, not sure where i picked up the info wrong.",but this makes sense and the thread count on the 13600 and 13900 make sense now too!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you could just as well have 790 with ddr4.,or 690 with ddr5.,the chipset has no influence on the choice of memory (as the memory controller is integrated into the cpu anyway).,"literally the only difference between 690 and 790 is that 4 pcie lanes (of downstream chipset ) are upgraded from pcie gen 3.0 to 4.0. so, instead of having 3 pcie4.0 ssds you can now have 4 pcie4.0 ssds.",it's literally the only difference.,so if you don't care about adding *4* (!!!),"nvme ssd's (or don't mind one of them being 3.0 speed, then there is no practical difference between 690 and 790   (except price)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i7-13700k owner checking in, my igpu idles at about 0.002w so completely negligible, but anyone who is really bothered by that can disable it and still have it just 1 cmos clear away if needed for troubleshooting.","qsv encoding can be nice to have especially if you want to buy a radeon card and stream off of qsv (not sure about the state of radeon encoder these days, my last radeon card was a 5700xt, but qsv is practically indistinguishable from nvenc).",it's also another piece of overclockable hardware in your system for those who enjoy overclocking for the sake of overclocking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they have the igpu and it is disabled on the kf chips.,and the kf models will usually be a lower bin as opposed to the k variant.,so they might not oc as good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to be honest, this can go either way.","you could also have amazing core silicon and a tiny glitch in the igpu, and that gets marked down to a kf.","conversely, intel might be scraping off the best k silicon for the future ks model, which also needs a functional igpu.",iâ€™ve seen awesome kf units and horrible ones.,it really is a lottery.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"k also adds the advantage if you ever have gpu issues you can use the igpu to try to diagnose the issue before you rma your card or send it to a local computer shop, unless you have a cpu lying around with an igpu that works with your current socket.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is no non-k 13700 yet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah going for cinebench scores this can be important,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for the price difference between k and kf you could just buy spare gt 730. then you can troubleshoot igpu issues.,how frequent is igpu issues you face.,doesn't make sense.,but k is definitely better for a slightly better but negligible performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can encode with the igpu so it does help.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in most scenarios, you'd be using the encoder on the graphics card for game streaming so functionally will still be the same.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no problem!,"if the deal on the kf is quite a bit better than the k variant, go for it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"both will look about the same at the low bitrates required for most people trying to stream on twitch tbh, assuming using h264; somewhat similar to x264 fast.","*maybe* nvenc has a bit less block artificating, but is more blurry.","fast motion looks bad on both though, tbh.","i don't think nvidia have made any changes to the h264 encoder since turing, all improvements since have been related to h265 or av1.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not sure.,wouldnâ€™t hurt to try.,i just know that encoding with the igpu on 12th/13th gen is really good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i have a spare gpu hanging around if my main one goes out but itâ€™s handy to not have to go that route if you can avoid it.,iâ€™m glad amd finally added igpus to their new ryzen lineup.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

encoders donâ€™t make performance differences but it affects the bit rate of an image.,like a good encoder makes a 1080p video look like itâ€™s in 1080p and not just 360p with more pixels,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thereâ€™s an argument that youâ€™ll lose a slight amount of gpu performance in doing so.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"only $360 usd sealed, very low",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s pretty impressive.,"cpu encoding usually is overlooked, never thought it would actually be close.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how do i pick it?,in obs only cpu and nvenc show up i think?,can i see a screenshot of yours in options of obs?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd recommend them more now if prices weren't so bad.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they affect it slightly.,"run a benchmark with no streaming, then run a benchmark with nvenc streaming and run the same with quicksync.","youâ€™ll probably have the most fps streaming, second with quicksync and nvenc will come in last.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the built in nvidia encoder.,theyâ€™re basically saying just use the encoders on your main gpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i stated.,usually.,you got a good bin.,thats why it's called a lottery winner.,most buyers do not.,and they bin those chips to cherry pick the potential upcoming ks variant.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in advance, for purchasing?",nope.,silicon lottery is literally a lottery.,"you could get one that meets intelâ€™s spec, or one that greatly exceeds it.",overclockers pay big money for good overclocking chips.,"asusâ€™ sp rating is a basic way to roughly determine how good a chip is (although what it bases that on is not the sole metric for how well a chip will overclock), but you donâ€™t know what you got till itâ€™s installed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fair but yeah they usually release k and kf versions first and then other stuff starts coming a few months later,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the 10900k is a 10th gen cpu and has igpu functionality, but the newer gen chips seem to be more geared towards streamers than the older generations, the new 13900k's igpu is also twice as fast.",i can't seem to find much info on this either as i have a 10850k and stream sometimes.,i would like to upgrade to the new 13900k but i'm poor...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yes even if he has nvidia, since itâ€™s still taking marginal processing power to use the asic.","quicksync is also an asic, but the igpu isnâ€™t part of the cpu, it just shares the physical space.",the cpu load is similar whether youâ€™re using the igpu decode asic or the dgpu decode asic.,"however, if the dgpu is rendering at the same time, it canâ€™t render as many frames compared to when the nvenc asic isnâ€™t active.","that being said, weâ€™re talking single digits to 10 frames when the unaffected rate is 140+ fps.",itâ€™s not significant but itâ€™s noticeable if youâ€™re tracking and recording fps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

iâ€™d say yes if your close to thermal throttling.,or just want lower temps in general.,they are cheap and effective and makes sure thereâ€™s no cpu bending/warping.,if you have no issues your fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i ordered one for my recently purchased 13700k.,i'm getting 32â°-37â° idle temps and 65â°-70â° while gaming and with the thermalright contact frame.,so far so good and i'm still using my old aio (nzxt kraken x52).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i ordered it cause why not make it 5-10c cooler if you can.,"plus i live in a hot climate, and any cooling i can get helps",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would get it even if i were to undervolt.,people that had use it report 5 - 10c decrease under high stress test.,you don't want to run your cpu cooler and your pc noise lower by just spending 12 usd.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so i just take off the ilm and put the bracket on, but make sure i screw it in evenly and a little at a time without over tightening correct?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"using an i5 13600k with an arctic lf ii 360, gaming temps don't go above 65-70. should i still get one?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got it for my 12700k/12900k setup and another for my 13900k.,now in my own personal experience i saw a very very marginal difference temp wise for my 13900k maybe about 2-3 degrees.,so i donâ€™t really think it is worth it for that but for peace of mind it is totally worth the money.,it is a straightforward process with no real way to go wrong installing it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have been using an i7-12700f for 4 months now with a deepcool ak620 cooler and have had no temp issues or any other issues.,i am going to say that only true overclocking enthusiasts need them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"even if you don't overclock, do you really want your expensive cpu to end up being bent into a pringle?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i haven't installed the 13700k yet, just ordered it, so no acutally temp stats yet for my (planned) build.",should/can i try it out without a frame first and see how my temps are doing?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah exactly.,if you get memory errors you likely overnighted and pins aren't making correct contact anymore.,just have to back it off a bit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most people report around a 5c drop.,i have a 12700k that doesnt go above 55c in gaming with a arctic 240mm.,yours seems to run hot with that big of a cooler.,what type of cpu usage are you getting?,"i play on 1440p so it's not over 50% usually, when i installed my thermalright bracket i noticed about 3-5c drop in games, and about 5-10 in stress testing.",edit: the 13600k is amazing at undervolting without losing much performance if you wanted to make it cooler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"12700 is a comparatively easy chip to cool, the 13700k has the same heat output as the 12900k which can be close to thermal throttle territory with all but the best coolers and can definitely use the help of a $10 contact frame",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the thermalright bracket is so cheap that i think it is a no-brainer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"tbh the frame is cheap ($10-12) and it's rare you can trade just $10 for a measurable thermal difference in your computer- well worth it, especially if you plan to run long workloads like renders.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
go ahead and get one.,that way you don't have to tear the system down again later.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just got my 13700k.,putting together my build tomorrow with a thermalright frame on first go.,after watching a few videos i think it will be relatively straight forward and easy to do.,i'll let you know my experience tomorrow.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i play 1440p too and get less than 50%.,though to be fair i've only measured timespy and got 65â°.,i'll record some gaming temps today.,(just built the pc 3 days ago so couldnt benchmark a lot),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but i'd lose the warranty for my cpu (and motherboard?,"), wouldn't i?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nice, thanks, will look forward to it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i don't think so, plus you can always put the standard bracket back to its place, there is no seal whatsoever that proves you have tinkered with it.","the thermalright bracket makes contact with the mobo upon mounting, so unlike with the more expensive thermal grizzly bracket you cannot bend the pins by overtightening.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hey i finished my build last night.,"contact frame was a pretty easy install as expected, i don't think you can easily mess it up.",my temps are seeming good.,35â°c - 45â°c in idle.,"58 - 65â°c in mw2, in the 70s in 2042, and about 50 in overwatch.",in cinebench it gets to 94â°c max tho but it says it doesn't throttle.,i am using a 240mm aio fyi so temps should be better if you use a bigger one.,i personally would install the cpu with the contact frame.,"it literally can't hurt, it's easy to do, and will give you some peace of mind that you are doing the best you can do to keep your cpu temps cooler.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have a a770 but don't use it for any streaming, however i do hope you're not using the card in a primary system.","you're going to spend a lot of time trying to get things to work, and if you do, will have to settle with mediocre performance.",i don't mind the tinkering as i have it in a secondary system i play around with but no way would i use it in my main system for gaming- at least not yet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

just to add to this.,this may change with the new av1 encoder that amd is saying for their new gpus next month.,so it could change but its unknown at the moment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

heat or power usage will not really be a problem when gaming.,i9 has higher stock overclocking and uses around 120 w while gaming.,"you may save 10-40 w by using lower end cpus, but they will also have lower default overclocking.","if you manage to manually overclocking all other cpus to the same clocks as i9, the i9 probably uses a dozen more watts due to the extra e-cores compared to the other cpus.","on the other hand, it is probably easier to get higher clocks with the i9.",heat will only become an issue when running all-core workloads at 253 w (default powerlimit) or 300+ w (unlimited).,"but in the end, you will probably not see any meaningful difference between those cpus while gaming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

waste of sand according to gamers nexus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because zen 3 -> zen 4 ipc uplift for cpu-z is 1%.,basically nothing.,difference is purely frequency.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is for single thread benchmark.,relies more on clock speed.,it can also be a stock variant.,"rank/score depends on cooling, silicon quality, and clock speed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looks like they undervolted 7950x to show a fake(this is why you should not buy an amd cpu).,but i'm not sure cuz 5.6 ghz for 14 core cpu is insane!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

im like 90% sure the hwinfo is a little bugged when it comes to throttling report on 13th gen. as for some reason hwinfo reports anything over 90c as throttling but if you look at clock speed it is not throttling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah, from your comment it looks like a thermal issue.",you can check the temperature limits in the bios but tjmax should be 100c.,there could be some kind of soft limit for temperature which slows it down a bit when going over 95c.,cpus also lose quite a lot of efficiency when running very hot.,however at 224w the 29k result is normal and that is a good amount of power for an air cooler.,so you can also just ignore all this.,i would set the max package power to 220w to avoid thermal throttling at all and if you want to increase performance you can look at setting a small negative voltage offset.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

mind me asking what your power limit is?,i thought about tweaking power settings and i did try undervolting by -0.040 which gave me 5 degree differences give or take but not really enough to warrant keeping the change given its not throttling stock.,did you change max power draw from 253?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

look at the power usage in hwinfo or hwmonitor.,90 isn't bad.,in your bios set the pl1 and pl2 power limits to something reasonable your cooler can handle.,might be set to 4000w+.,different bioses call the setting different things so you'll have to look it up.,maybe try 180w then use the hwinfo or hwmonitor to see the max power draw and temperatures.,there might also be a temperature limit setting in the bios if you want.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"*seems* kinda high for a 13600k w/ 360 aio, maybe it's a case of not enough contact in the middle of the cpu?","might want to check how the thermal paste spread on the cpu, if it looks like it isn't making enough contact, then it might be a good reason to get a contact frame.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

too much thermal paste can also impact cooling performance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so here's the data from my last few days of testing.,i have an i5 13600k and an asrock z790 steel legend wifi.,the default uefi settings allows the chip to draw 200w+ continuously without stepping down.,initially i had a thermalright pa120 air cooler and this was barely able to keep the temps at 91-92c during a 10 minute cinebench run.,"manually power limiting the chip to something more reasonable like 160w dropped temps to around 75c but resulted in a cinebench score reduction of about 24000 to about 22000.

after playing around with power budget a little more, i thought it worthwhile to replace my air cooler with a 360mm aio (deepcool castle 360ex) to get a little more headroom on thermals and not worry about.",with the 360mm aio i am seeing about 82-83c at the 200w+ unlimited powaahhh setting.,with more reasonable settings i am seeing ~70c under 160w loads and 60c at its stock 125w tdp.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
many thanks for this!,"so, it is normal for temps to reach such a degree in cinebench?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i thought the same thing, so i decided to make this post.",the aio does seem a bit off.,"just after a couple of days using this aio, its fans stopped spinning and randomly turns on during times of moderate load (which is surprising considering that during idle the fans are almost always spinning).",i'm not sure if this is normal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"why do you all use the term ""bottleneck"" so wrong.","a piece of hardware will not ""bottleneck"" another piece of hardware.",both the cpu and gpu will perform at their irrespective max performance.,"however when we are talking about running software and overall performance, we ask what will be the bottleneck?",my cpu or my 8 year old gpu.,obviously the old gpu will not be able to keep up with the system and slow down overall performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what?,why would i get that when its worse than a 5600x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wdym?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i donâ€™t think itâ€™s an inappropriate use of the term.,"other terms like â€œlimitâ€ or â€œconstrictâ€ are also valid, but in addition to â€œbottleneckâ€ simply being inherently visual and easy to grasp, consider this description from wikipedia:

> a bottleneck is a process in a chain of processes, such that its limited capacity reduces the capacity of the whole chain.","if we consider each piece of hardware as a â€œprocessâ€, and overall system performance as â€œcapacityâ€, then any weak piece of hardware that due to its existence in the chain does not allow the others to run at full capacity, would be a â€œbottleneckâ€.","the fact that software runs on hardware is immaterial, because we can change the hardware and improve the same softwareâ€™s performance, meaning the hardware is the source of the performance limitation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because it maxes out the 980 ti.,"the 12100f is faster than any mainstream cpu that existed then, by a large margin.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes you've basically explained my whole argument.,"and no one said anything about software being the source of the performance limitation, but it still can be.","doesn't matter what hardware change you make, if it's not optimized or efficient no hardware will increase performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think if we just replace â€œbottleneckâ€ with â€œbe a bottleneck toâ€ everything works out fine, and is what was intended in the first place.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the term was very popular a few years ago, all the reviewers talked about bottlenecks (i think it was around the time the gaming industry started to move from quad cores and the old 6600k started to seriously limit gaming performance).","and after that we have had thousands and thousands â€œwill this bottleneckâ€ questions, which almost always are utterly pointless as the answer completely depends on what kind of a workload your software or game puts on the parts and most modern games can max out the fastest gpus with any mid range cpu.",the correct form of the question which they mean to ask would be e.g.,â€œwould these parts be well balanced for 1080p gaming experience?â€ thatâ€™s a useful not too specific question which still gives enough information to give a generalized answer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ram speed above 6800 and approaching 50~ ns largely depends on the motherboard if you are using hynix a-die or hynix m-die.,6 layers generally max out at around 7000 - 7200.,"8 layers, or 2 ram slots design will be needed for running at higher than 7200 stable.",especially when pushing timing closing in on 50ns.,both z690 and z790 are similar in this regard.,"for ddr5 6000, you shouldn't see any perceivable differences between a z690 or a z790 motherboard, on basically any kind of ram regardless of brand.",especially if the motherboards are in the same tier.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is a bit anecdotal but i have tried 2 different z690 boards with a 64gb kit of kingston 5600mt/s ddr5.,gigabyte z690 aero d would not post at 5600mt/s.,i returned it and picked up an msi z690 carbon wifi for my 13900k and everything worked perfectly with the msi board.,i stuck with z690 because for the money it did what i needed and z790 boards were substantially more expensive for minimal gains.,i do not plan to get faster ram down the road because i don't see the need for my use case.,the simple answer is that z790 in general has better memory support so there is a difference.,not sure how many z690 boards are even rated to be able to handle 32gb of ddr5 at 6000mt/s.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, absolutely get a z790 4 dimm at the minimum if it's not too pricey.",z690 kingpin is too pricey but is a good board for z690.,"there were optimizations made to z790 boards, which is why kits limit 6800 mt/s to z690, but z790 goes beyond 7200 mt/s.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what you said makes no sense.,"z790 motherboards are already an extra $100 upfront at the minimum, paying extra for features he doesn't need and potentially higher resale value is doing the math incorrectly.","also, nobody intentionally populates all 4 dimm slots with ddr5.",any motherboard run 4 dimm at a significantly reduced speed.,"since he is talking about ddr5 6000, he obviously cares a little bit about his memory speed.",how many ram slots it has is kinda moot in this context.,you always want to use 2x32 gb instead of 4x16gb for ddr5 board.,"if you are ever going to be buying less ram and upgrade later you should stick with ddr4

disabling the page file will cause programs to crash generally.,anytime a program or driver tries to allocate a big block of memory and it's not immediately available the allocation will fail at which point the program is probably going to exit or outright crash.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it isn't that windows freaks out with no page file but rather that if you want to run without a page file you need a lot of free ram (on any os) to make sure that you never have a page fault that cannot be met with only pages in ram.,way more ram then your program actually needs to run with a page file.,"if you have even one page fault that the os cannot satisfy, your program is done running.","32gb might have been enough at some point in the past, but as games (and gpu drivers) get more complex you'll need more and more ram to make sure that never happens.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

> there's a weird thing with it though.,"you can have 16gb ram and 4gb page (20gb addressable) and have zero issues, while having 32gb ram and no page file causes issues, despite being 12 more gb addressable space.",i've gotten out of memory crashes in chrome with 32gb of ram and a 6 gb page file.,it is pretty easy to have tens of gb worth of pages in the page file with normal windows programs.,"just looking now, i've got 15gb/32gb of ram allocated (mostly chrome) and 34gb of pages committed with nothing much running on a i5-6600k.",so i have half my memory free and more than twice that much committed.,by default windows manages the size of the page file.,"if you have a page fault and there isn't room in the file, it simply makes it bigger.",thus no page fault will fail unless the hard disk is full.,"if you cap the size (which is also a bad idea), windows will see that the page file is filling up and aggressively flush pages to try and keep some space available, programs will see that memory allocations are failing and try to use less, and some processes will crash (possibly without you knowing especially for background ones).","all of these things free up some pages, so hopefully your foreground task can keep running.",>this is also assuming an unchanged workload in terms of pre-allocated memory.,part of why you need the page file is that modern operating systems don't use pre-allocated memory.,when you call virtualalloc() the system reserves address space but does not allocate actual pages since that would waste memory.,"instead, the first load/store to a new address generates a page fault, which then causes the operating system to allocate a page in memory.",this way memory is only allocated if it is actually going to be used.,"if a program requests memory but doesn't actually write to it (or even just a part of it), the os never allocates a page and so saves that ram.","this is great in that you need a lot less ram than the sum of what your programs have requested, but it also means that at any moment the os could find that programs suddenly activate pages.",the ability to make the page file as big as needed covers for the fact that you might (transiently) need a lot of memory even though on average you have lots free.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yes - intelâ€™s own material actually talked about the goal of pentium 4â€™s ipc being lower than p3, though overall performance being higher because of much higher clock speeds.","in practical terms, p3â€™s integer code was about 20-30% faster per clock,  though for well written software they were about equal ipc on x87/sse code.",(cannot find it but one of the anandtech reviews referred to the p4â€™s fpu as running just like a p3 but at higher clocks).,pentium 4 did initially reach much higher clocks than pentium 3 on the same process.,"2.0 ghz vs 1.10-1.13 on 180nm, and >3.2 ghz vs 1.4 ghz on 130nm*.",the p4 was a different enough architecture that some of the early reviews looked really bad because code had to often be recompiled or sometimes reworked to run well on p4.,"..

*tmi - what made this even more awkward was intel started shipping pentium 3â€™s up to 1.4 ghz in 2001 on 130nm while pentium 4 was still on 180nm.",by the end of 2002 though the 3.06 ghz p4 left even highly overclocked (1.7 ghz) 130nm p3â€™s in the dust.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's why intel core is based on p3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"at the time the general public was heavily relying on clock speed as an indicator of cpu performance, especially since we were getting a very steady increase in clock speeds for quite a few generations.","so yes, intel decided to go all-in for frequency, sacrificing ipc and thermals along the way, since it was much easier to sell 3ghz cpu than 1.5ghz cpu even if the latter had better performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it was also in the switch from sdr to ddr if i remember correctly.,"i just bought my first pc then, assumed the p4 was the best and picked a p4 with sdr...i learned my lesson.",do your damn research first!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, p4 was a technological dead end.",it was supposed to compensate by higher clocks but ultimately failed to reach them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, it was faster per clock than first gen willamette due to it having very long execution pipelines meant to improve as intel ramped up the frequency.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/netburst_(microarchitecture)#hyper-pipelined_technology

sometimes i wonder what a p4 could do on 5nm.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah it ultimately was a worse architecture under basically all points of views and intel implicitly recognized that in the end by thrashing it entirely after pentium d and the scrapped tejas (what was rumored as pentium v) and going back to what the original pentium iii (and ii) uarch had become over the years in the form of pentium m to make the first core archs, but to be fair netburst was always conceived with higher clocks in mind so such a comparison doesn't make much sense.",it never was a particularly competitive product performance-wise but it did manage to handily beat old piiis when clocks actually started rising.,unfortunately for intel the growth halted at 4ghz on the 90nm tech they had back in the days and they had to change their plans accordingly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes but why tf is this a gif?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yup not surprising.,"the pentium 4 marked intel massively extending the pipeline to chase higher and higher clock speeds, particularly famous with netburst.","this, especially back then, meant if there was a pipeline mispredict or something, you'd be flushing most of a much larger pipeline.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i had a dual p3 1266mhz box that lasted longer than the entire p4 (netburst) lineup did.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,pentium 4's design plan was to sacrifice ipc for the ability to scale frequency arbitrarily high.,"we never saw the 6ghz beasts they intended, but that was the idea.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
p4 had a longer pipeline that enabled higher clock speeds.,it also heavily relied on sse2 optimizations to be performant.,"however, it did take us beyond 3 ghz and intelâ€™s software enabling ensured sse2 was supported by major games and applications so it did perform much better than the p3 by its second generation.","first gen willamette wasnâ€™t great, required expensive rambus memory and had low clocks.","the northwood lasted quite a while, ram cooler, had ddr ram and was easily overclockable.",like the pentium 4 1.6a generally hit 2.1 ghz with zero effort by bumping the fsb from 100 (400) to 133 (533) mhz.,"prescott came after that and extended the pipeline further, to aim for higher clocks, had lower clock for clock performance and ram hotter.","the israeli team took the p5c architecture (pentium) and made it more efficient with the pentium m, which eventually lead to conroe on desktop and the introduction of the core line that regressed in clock speed but delivered amazing performance per watt at the time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yes, i agree with this man right here.","as silly as it sounds, the truth is you will not feel a difference in 2000 mt/s with ddr5, and while the primary timings look and are quite loose, the vast majority of benchmarks will show nearly very little to no difference, games will not feel faster, at these speeds with intel, were at a point where honestly the only way i could get anything to feel any snappier that works though its deployment method people have a crazy variance of opinion, but i run 3 980pro 1tb nvme drives in raid 0, or striped, as i get 3x the performance which is still stupid margins for real life tasks, and i do risk losing my data 3x more than others arguably, but i still keep 3tb of storage, games load very fast, its not uncommon to not see a progress bar for a whole second installing some software, but the unseen til i tried it benefits include 10-17c temp drops on all 3 drives from idle to load respectively, and the total writes to all drives are not only even but 3x less than using one at a time.","samsung magician does not work, and i cannot usefully overprovision my drives, but even though with a killer sample 13900k that runs 6.29ghz on 3 cores and over 6.0 on the rest of p cores, i get better scores by running at 5.8/5.6 and 4.6 on e, while mce enabled, i set limits to 270 p0 and 255w p1 with 448 second bursts, or 128 seconds with xtu.. lol.","my temps stay below 72c idle at 23-27c and it uses less than 1.3v at all times, so high numbers look good on paper, and its cool to see an almost 6.3ghz oc, my cinebench r23 scores are near 43000 multi with these settings, right under 40,000 stock even without xmp on ddr4-2133 for baseline, that speaks for itself... scores are 41000 when at 6.29 power unlimited and just let it thermal throttle to 84c on its own, so i much prefer the great temps and low voltage which i do all from ai as manually i really cannot beat these with any noticeable difference and be stable.","i can also turn mce off and get almost the same results, there are many ways to skin a cat here, but to sum it up, i actually do better with b-die ddr4 4133 oc to 4533 cl14 than ddr5-6200 cl38, other than aida64 memory speeds and latency is much better, yet still unnoticeable.","i go based on real world usage and feel and silicon bliss over what i read, most of what i watch and what it says on the box!",i would comfortably say the days of ram overclocking benefits for daily usage are over as of this current new wave of ddr5 kits.,"you can have a ... measuring contest over timings all day long, but the same os and hardware on 2 systems one with ddr4-4533 and ddr5-6200 the above average person even won't be able to guess which is which without reading the numbers, some will finish first on one some on the other.","it's hard to imagine why anyone would need more than a 13600k for anything even intensive workloads, these things are just amazing right out of the box, and thats the first time i have ever said that!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"oh, multi-core.",gaining 1000 on a single core would be a huge overclock xd,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i hit 40900 overclocked and undervolted on my 13900k with mce off.,i never ever throttle.,i was getting 41000 overclocked and undervolted with mce on and i was thermal throttling.,not worth having it on tbh.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
assumng your undervolt is stable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
undervolt is very stable :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i switched out the radiators in my custom loop and my case.,i run 3 420mm radiators with a d5 pump now and with mce on u will throttle no matter what when overclocked and undervolted.,itâ€™s not worth the extra 300-600 points.,i rather have good temps and pretty much same performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"iirc this is just for the nvidia gpu, in order to change it for the igpu you would have to go to settings>display >advanced display settings >and change the resolution from there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thats what i was thinking too but all i see is the 120hz ones, when i got it to work for the first time there were 144 hz ones all the way at the bottom but now they are gone",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can you please tell me what cpu are you using?,"depending on the igpu, it may be locked to 120hz",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i5 11400h, that is very likely because it happened after a driver update (rolling it back didnt fix it though)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this is just a guess but maybe changing the resolution to pc 1080 should allow you to set it to 144hz, also check if your monitor is in pc mode and not av or any other modes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there are programs to add custom resolutions and refresh rates,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's the point!,i want to set it to pc 1080 but i don't know where i can do that with the intel igpu controlling the hdmi port,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"tried that already, pixel clock is maxing out at 297 for some reason, though i've found the most likely solution for the problem im having, my hdmi cable is like a year old now i think it needs replacing, i plug the hdmi cable in and out everyday so its bound to go wrong, thanks for replying though :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ohhhh i thought you didn't know how to change the refresh rate lol, well there aren't that many places where you can do that, and certainly nvidia panel won't help, is it not showing in the display settings or is it grayed out?","if so then as i said before, check your monitors settings first.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's just not there, it used to be at the bottom though, and both the tv and pc were available, now only the tv ones aremonitor settings don't give me any info here  
could the response time setting doing it?",i have it set to 1ms (fastest) theres fast and normal so im guessing 2 ms and 4 ms,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's definitely the monitor, as i said check its settings, for me its under menu > system > pc/av mode.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i would rma the cooler.,cold radiator+ hot cpu means something is wrong.,let the manufacturer figure out what.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seen this movie many times before.,you need to check the positioning of the coolerâ€™s cold plate and thermal paste coverage.,"in addition, make sure the pump and fans on your aio are running.",often people plug the aio into a connector on their motherboard that is not addressed for the cpu fan or cpu pump.,get into the bios and make sure the pump and fans are set to be controlled by the cpu temperature and that pwm is enabled for the fans.,when youâ€™re done report back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not normal at all.,do you have the lga 1700 backplate?,do you have multi core enhancement or something similar on in your bios?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this is something weird then, i have 13700k with noctua nh-d15 without any contact frame, and playing most demanding game i have 70âºc , then running cinebench r23 it goes up to 85âºc after 10 minutes thermal trhttle test.","so deffinitly you dont need contact frame, but in your case something wrong with the aio or his pump i guess.","&#x200b;

ps: forget to say i have power w unclock, so cpu its hity 5.3 ghz all the time playing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
something has to be wrong with the mount or something wrong with your aio.,do you have the fan cable of the pump going into cpu fan header?,you have iâ€™m sure removed the plastic from the block right?,are the standoffs for the aio flush with the motherboard when screwed in?,make sure when you put the pump/block on the standoffs the bracket is not getting hung up on the  threads and not fully down on the stand offs (i noticed this when mounting mine).,i have a 13900k and arctic freezer ii 360 and never get thermal throttling even when benchmarking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you didn't forget to peel off the plastic wrapper on the cold plate?,you could try reseating the cooler and observe wether it fixes your temperature problem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have an arctic 280, i can't really ever hear the pump or water flow.",i haven't heard you mention fans at all.,"when your cpu goes under load, your radiator fans are spinning up and maxing out right?",they'd be so loud they will surely drown out any aio noises.,at 100 degrees your fans should be 100%.,a til about arctic coolers - the radiator fans and pump are wired together.,the pump speed will max out when the fan header hits 40% pwm.,you can try setting your fan curve in your bios to be at a minimum of 40% for the header that your aio is plugged into.,this will ensure the pump is always at max.,"while you're at it, visually confirm that both radiator fans are functioning .","also, the fact that your windows fails to boot some times tells me you might be having some socket pressure induced instability.",i would re-seat the cpu and triple check the aio mount.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and for your info, contact frame on 13th gen make 0 difference, search for in on google",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe the pump is messed up?,it should increase automatically.,i donâ€™t think you can control it in bios.,idle is mostly normal.,maybe a bit high.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would try a different cooler or rma that one in case it came bad.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
check that you have the most recent bios version.,sometimes bios bugs cause excessive power consumption.,but if the radiator doesn't get warmer your cooler has to be broken.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have 13600k + 280mm corsair aio cooler, with push/pull setup.",i don't go above 60c most of the time.,something is most likely wrong with your cooler.,did you try undervolting your cpu?,and see if the temps still goes high?,just to make sure if something is wrong with your cooler?,and not sure if you have any other types of cooler lying around?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i dont know it may be some of the cpus are more uniforms then others (talking about same model, just different units) cuz i jsut did the test right now

i got 95âºc max on cr23 after 5 minutes loop without any contact frame,

then i just installed the thermarlight frame that i purched same day as 13700k but not installed, and i got 94âºc max same cr23 same ambient temp.","now occt test after 2 hours same test for both case i got 1âºc hotter with thermarlight frame versus stock....

so i guess is just margin of errors and in my case i got exactly same temperature with and without frame",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the aio came with the 1700 upgrade kit?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
contact frame is the answer.,idle temps show the pump works correctly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you try undervolting?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i agree.,"i just built the same setup 13700k with artic lf ii 420, no contact frame and while gaming i get around 55-70c.",running prime 95 i hit 90-95c.,this is all stock settings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>then running cinebench r23 it goes up to 85âºc after 10 minutes thermal trhttle test.,those look like temps with the intel power limits enabled  from all the threads i've seen about these new cpus.,i'm guessing you're using the intel 253w intel limit?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is not true.,on average i see people getting decreased temps of around 5â°c.,"some more, some less.",exactly like 12th gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you nuts?,there's already been at least 4 threads in intel's /r with people showing over 10 c improvement after applying contact frame.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah ima call bullshit, i got a contact frame.",10c less on average under full load.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there's barely any heat transfer, but there is, as his idle temps are low enough to indicate cooler is alright.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
must be nice playing 2022 aaa games at 15frames per second in 1080p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not really i dont ahve contact frame and with nhd15 i got 70âºc playing and 85 on cinebench test loop,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i keep hearing this, but can it really make the difference between **cold** radiator (apparently no contact all?)",and proper contact = warm radiator and heat dissipated?,"people are reporting that it helps, but shouldn't my cpu be useable without it?","i don't even overclock or care about cinebench scores/temperatures, i just wanna play games without this thing overheating.",i even tried undervolting and it barely reduced gaming temps if at all.,this thing uses only about 120w in cyberpunk 2077 and still hits 100 degrees.,am i just incredibly unlucky with my aio and cpu combination and it simply won't work without the contact frame?,oh and happy cake day btw!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
undervolting doesn't fix broken coolers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this.,i have been hesitant to buy one of these considering these hit thermal limits and i also want to use an air heatsink.,i believe they call this cpu lite.,my xeon 14 core e5-2697v3 doesn't get above 70c under full load with an evo 212.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's because you don't have [this shit](https://i.imgur.com/ecsgbd2.jpg) and there are ihs' even worse than that and op's case might also be shit like this.,i've dropped by almost 30c after sanding down the ihs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no dude, im using 4096 on long and short duracion, and 512a, this is the maximum performance of all 12th and 13th gen cpus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it can be true but after few months of cpu beeibg used with stock retention.,because at the begining the cpu is flat and take some.time.to start bending...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it can be the case sometimes if your cpus has the ihs not as flat as is should be.,but for the 13th gen they did the ihs more flat compared with 12th gen. in general for this 13th you dont need to use frame,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that chip idles at around 15w so as long as any water is moving that should be enough to keep idle temperature down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not really what, since lf ii got flat cold plate and his 13700k sure as fk is not flat?","pump also works correctly, as his idle temp are waaaaaaaaay too low for aio related issues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"12700k + lf ii (i gen), lapping shaved close to 30c in my case.","contact frame won't do as dramatic change, but it'll surely help tons.","make sure you've got no foil under the coldplate too and that you're using lga1700 mounting and that [sledges don't rest on vrm heatsink](https://i.imgur.com/xfdfdbh.jpg) (z690-a strix d4 in this case, changed for a-pro, couldn't be happier about it lol).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not so sure its broken...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not bad then.i've seen lots of threads of thermal throttling with power limits disabled on a 13700k when using cinebench.,85c was around  the temps ppl would get after enabling the intel power limits on the threads i've seen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no they did not, there's been absolutely no ihs manufacturing adjustments, it's the same godawful lottery of what you're gonna get.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think your confused.,the problem isnt the ihs.,its the ilm thats bending the cpu and making so cooler cannot make good contact with the cpu.,thats why contact frames are still being recommended if your having cooling issues,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"15w is enough to warm coldplate with no waterflow to 40c, which will resolve in temps being in low 60s.","especially by noticing, that idle temps are really not that far off from regular idle temps - pump is working.",instantaneous temperature climbing under load indicates foil under coldplate or terrible contact between ihs and cooler.,aired pump would also have very high idle temps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the description clearly describes either broken cooler or defective installation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"but still higher than my 12700k, i just jumped from 12700k to this 13700k and for example same test same cooler same condition everything i had max on 12700k, 70âºc max core there are 15c difference but it is worth it because this one is doing 5.3 ghz all the time and 4.2 ghz on ecore while the 12700k doing 4.7 ghz and 3.6 somethign like that...

&#x200b;

so to be honest it is very nice to see finally a cpu speed at 5.3 ghz all cores out of the box even if the temps are higher but gaming i have around 70c so im ok with that.","now definitly if i do prime95 small packets avx2 or occt small packets it will throttling at 100âºc, but not only my ... all 13600k/13700k/13900k whatever cooler you have, maybe only very powerfull custom cooling it can be save it but i doubt...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, you can't say something like that, neither you nor i can know if they really have made any adjustments to the ihs internally in manufacturing, likewise intel has never published anything official admitting that 12th gen bends and loses adhesion with the heatsink.",they are small details that very few users know about.,"and to confirm, right now i have just installed the thermarlight contact frame and in my case there is no difference at all (yes 1âºc less in one test, and 1âºc more in another test) with which i suppose it is simply a margin of error.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no im not confused, the ihs will be not as flat as it should be after bending ocurrs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
both ihs and ilm are the issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
try reading it again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, i can, because ihs is literally the same and people have the same lottery, because this is related to manufacturing process, which is the same and we've already seen there are quite a handful of people having shit temperatures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
...right.,so getting a contact frame fixes the issue by not causing bending once ilm is switched.,the ilm didnt change from 12th gen. which is why bending still occurs and its extremely cheap and effective to get a contact frame.... so yeah its recommended and necessary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have read it.,not only does it not describe an issue that undervolting is a suitable solution to in the first place but the diagnosis steps he had taken already point out that the cooler doesnâ€™t seem to be properly removing heat from the cpu as there is no heat coming out.,there is absolutely no way that a 13700k (or any desktop cpu for that matter) overheats in games with any halfway decent cooler unless something is broken.,"as he says, his cpu should come anywhere near 100c.",proposing undervolting as a solution is just stupid.,edit: undervolting is something you can do to gain extra performance or efficiency after making sure your cpu thermals are ok.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you can't go wrong with an arctic liquid freezer ii,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you should buy the largest aio that can fit in your case.,you can also consider getting a third party mounting frame.,i have seen reports of those lowering the temperatures by 8-10 degrees due to much better contact with the cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have the nzxt z63 280mm for my 5800x and it works well.,youâ€™d probably be better off with a 360 if youâ€™re going i7 but it also has to do with good airflow in your case too.,donâ€™t forget to use good paste too.,"switching to kryonaut, my temps dropped a few extra c.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you!,may i ask which aio u have?,is deepcool brand ok?,thx!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i donâ€™t use aios (closed liquid cooling).,i do all custom open liquid cooling.,so iâ€™m not too sure about which aios are best.,iâ€™d suggest looking on youtube for some comparisons as to which 360 mm aio performs best.,i do know that the corsair and arctic aios tend to be pretty good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"3770 is ancient and it shows, plus 1333 mhz ram won't help either.",you will not see gains when using anything stronger than 1080 as your cpu and ram are simply too ancient.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™d buy a 850w power supply for future upgrades given how power hungry new chips are getting.,850w could handle a 4080 if you were ambitious down the road.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i wonder if it would work the same on my 9700k as i have the rebar bios update for my motherboard available.,it explicitly says that it supports 10-th gen and up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9700k/a770 owner checking in: no issues to report.,"can recommend 1440p over 1080p if you can help it, as it actually does better performance-wise at that resolution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">i have seen that ryzen 5000 series processors benefit from 4 sticks of ram


that's not exactly true.","4 sticks will perform better only if they are single rank, which means you will then have dual rank for each memory channel.",but using just 2 dual rank sticks will achieve the same and will also have more overclocking headroom because more sticks are harder to run.,in your case the sticks are likely dual rank (at least) for both kits since the capacity is very high so the best choice is 2x32gb.,"be aware that if you don't overclock you won't have any performance difference (assuming both kits have the same speed), so you might choose the 4 stick kit if looks is important to you, but i still advise against it because one day you might decide to manually tune your ram and that day you'll be kinda screwed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i don't really know how the 12th gen non k versions handle overclocked ram, but

the official jdec support for 13th gen intel is going to be stated as 4800mhz.,that's why you buy a motherboard that supports xmp and xmp memory.,the kingston beast ddr5 6000 that i have used (kf560c40bb-16) runs fine at its rated speed but timings are 40-40-40 @ 1.35 volts.,"it looks like your asrock board lists this memory as supported in it's spec documents, which is good.","but you might get slightly snappier performance with something like corsair ddr5 6000 (cmk32gx5m2d6000c36 ver 4.43.02) which is samsung chips running at 36-36-36 @ 1.35 volts, and also supported by your motherboard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have found the 5200mhz cl28 version.,"costs a little more than the 6000mhz cl36 from kingston, yet will it work more reliably here?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>choose it for it's 35w tdp as i want it the temps to be as low as possible with this small cooler.,"fwiw it doesn't actually use less power or run cooler, it just throttles harder by default.",since you can set any cpu to throttle however you want there is no point in specifically picking one because of the default throttle settings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"system agent voltage is integrated memory controller voltage within the cpu, intel's locked cpus got that voltage locked, which is outrageous as it limits ram speed to 3466-3600 mhz ddr4 or 6200-6600 mhz ddr5.","but these values are for system agent at 0.9-0.95v and there's no testimony from people with 12400t to what level is sa locked on that cpu, 12700h on instance got 0.8v, which renders it unable to run 3200 mhz at gear 1, which is hilarious.","i mentioned 12400f as it is a surefire for ram support and you can set every voltage and power limit anyway, so you can just limit it for 35 w or whatever and do voltage tweaking as well, to get even lower power for the same performance.","and from what i can see, 12400t is even more expensive, somehow.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thereâ€™s really no reason to buy the 12400t.,"just buy the 12400/f, know you wonâ€™t have issues with sa voltage, and set the power limits to whatever you determine your system cooling can handle.","that is to say, you can literally build your own 12400t and have more control over the process by starting off with a normal 12400.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ok i get it, yet the question still remains - can a 6000mhz kit work with a 12400t?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think probably no since the voltages are locked.,"however, if you are going to stick to 35w a difference of a few hundred mhz of dram clock is going to make little difference in any benchmark lasting more than 20 or 30 seconds.",the cpu will throttle and then the need for memory bandwidth will drop too.,if you get stuck at 5200 or 5600 it is probably not worth worrying about.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"considering the very restricted cooling clearance, temperature is the main aspect i chose this cpu for.",you're saying that the t-variant cpu's will simply just throttle at 35w regardless if the temps are still merely within the low 70's?,what would be the ideal ram speed you would recommend with this particular cpu then?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> you're saying that the t-variant cpu's will simply just throttle at 35w regardless if the temps are still merely within the low 70's?,"look up pl1/pl2 and tau, but yes essentially they try to throttle power consumption down to some maximum level after a short delay (tau).",temperature throttling is a different mechanism.,>what would be the ideal ram speed you would recommend with this particular cpu then?,for a low power build?,i'd aim to have enough of it for whatever you're doing and then buy whatever is cheapest.,"try to avoid anything that raises voltages, since that is just going to make you even more thermally limited.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe you need to clean fan or repaste cpu.,but this depends on your skill.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"since the laptop is old and the loss of fps is sudden, maybe the laptop is overheating?",you could try cleaning it (getting rid of dust and applying new thermal paste on the cpu).,"if you don't know how or don't want to risk any damage you can take it to a repair shop, this kind of maintenance isn't that expensive.",also usually a cpu will raise its ghz if it isn't overheating so you don't have to worry about that.,not like you can overclock a laptop chip yourself anyway.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what games?,some updates in games can kill performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it will turbo automatically if thermal allows it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in all games i have problem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how i can do that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looks like thermal problem.,clean your heat sink and replace the thermal paste.,"2450m is pushing 11 years old now, be careful with the thermal, other parts on the motherboard susceptible to degradation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 13600k.,more cache and higher clock speeds result in it being faster than the 12700k in gaming.,the e cores also make it faster for everything else.,it is a great cpu for the price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

>13600k's p-cores give it a gaming edge.,"e-cores don't benefit gaming (unless you play a lot of civ), but overall for general use or productivity the two cpu's basically trade blows.","e- cores can be benefit with gaming when you have a lot of task in background -  then e cores do this job like discord, gaming app,  etc and p cores focus only for gaming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and you think all the apps you listed can saturate 6 e-cores because?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it doesn't matter nearly as much as you think it does.,any game that's ever showed upward scaling for e-core was barely marginal gains.,many titles show similar gains by disabling e-cores altogether.,"rather the game can leverage e-cores or not is per-title, but e-cores on/off doesn't raise or lower the fps by any noticeable amount.",hence the conclusion they aren't doing much for games.,"in terms of background tasks, i dunno what you do but i can load up 500 tab chrome, discord, and a twitch stream, and watch it all use, at most, 10% of one core.",that won't infringe on any known game engine's workload.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it seems e-cores are mainly a cheap way for intel to add more cores that primarily benefit non-latency sensitive workloads where the p-cores are saturated.,"so when a p-core is ""available"", an e-core is useless.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the real question is, what are you trying to accomplish here?",are you asking for advice to use the least amount of power and achieve higher benchmarks?,or for day to day operation?,i have the 13700k as well.,during normal operations it runs between 38c to 47c.,"when gaming, it heats up to the mid 50's - low 60's.",when i use the extreme profile (msi center) it heats up to high 60's - low 70's.,i personally don't run benches as they serve no purpose for me because they don't reflect my normal usage.,edit: i also have the noctua nh-d15.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's because you've got n-cores ratio, which differs in regard to number of cores being used, ratios can be checked in bios.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your single thread score isn't going to improve unless you overclock because there's plenty of power and thermal headroom for one core to run at max clockspeed.,also consider testing your stability with other programs.,i've found cinebench r23 to be very lenient.,an undervolt that runs r23 can immediately crash r15 for example.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah basically that.,"i want it to run as quiet and cool as possible while not losing out too much performance, for that i've been searching for this undervolt sweet spot.","upgraded from 8700k i know it's a big jump regardless of what i do to the 13700k, but i don't want to leave performance on the table if i undervolt it too much.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
okay i see.,well you and i have dual tower air coolers.,there really isn't much headroom as these processors are very powerful out of the box.,custom water loops and aio(360mm or 420mm) fare a bit better.,"honestly, you won't tell a difference if you tried to squeeze out more performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
idle should be around 25-35. wz2 i get 60c i have a 13900k.,which is way hotter of a cpu under full load.,while 80-100 (depending cooler) is fine for all core workload.,gaming should not be that hot.,definitely a mounting or cooling issue,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i sorted it, didnâ€™t put enough paste on!",was more generous with some mx-4 and itâ€™s around 60-70 under load!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"heat transfer seems to not work, make sure you've got thermal paste and it's actually pressurized by cooler.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what cooler?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
happened to me too.,"i sent them a message, and they will auto send you instructions to send them a receipt showing the purchase and the master key.",then they will unlock it.,took them 3-business days.,"sent them on friday, and i got it on tuesday evening.","that said, tuesday morning i was able to redeem it already so ðÿ¤·â€â™‚ï¸",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"nah, you don't have to actually have used the product.","i still have my 11600k in the box, and i got my mw2 download the sunday after it launched.","(due to server crashes and then other issues) intel really had some issues with this free game giveaway, but be patient they will fix it for you.","once you send a confirm of sale and master key, usually 1-2 days max depending on if it's during the weekend or not.",good luck!,!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

right?,op isnâ€™t even asking for a solution; theyâ€™re just curious about what the reason for the block might be.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
exactly.,you come to reddit to ask a simple question then the only person who replies is this jack ass with their smart reply.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

okay but how could anyone here have any idea why?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"itâ€™s unlikely someone would know opâ€™s *specific* reason, but maybe someone else has had this same issue happen and could tell op what the issue was for them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cinebench does not reflect temps in gaming.,gaming would be lower temps whether you have mce on or off.. cinebench is all core workload at 100% cpu usage.,so yeah that will make things hot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with a 120mm fan cooler high temps under heavy load are normal.,"i would turn off mce, leave voltages at stock and not worry about it unless it's a problem under real world conditions.","if it is, buy a more appropriately sized heatsink for what is one of the hottest intel cpus in recent memory.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't use mce and just apply manual overclock with sensible voltages.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you could try changing the voltage to offset and negative and do -100mv or 0.100v.,it's interesting only the combo of mce and xmp causes such high temps and when not done together the temps are fine.,before doing any of that check and see if there is a bios update the newest update is from 2022/05/27â  and is version 1601 so it may be worth trying if it's on a really old one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sounds like your cooler is the issue.,i had a hyper212 on my 11700kf and was getting similar temps so i got a 240mm aio and it never got above 75c or so.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably why i got such a good deal.,$199 for the z590 p wifi mobo +$1 for 11700k combo deal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't know how to do that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why wasting money on k cpu and z chipset then?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mobo+cpu combo for $200.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
where did you get that combo for $200?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
micro center.,what's even better was an nvme m.2.,1t for $19.99.,this was in october.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you must have got it like a month ago where they had a store specific deal?,i think it was overland park?,otherwise the combo is $299 now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep yep,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
reset bios to defaults and clean format pc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

try running intel driver assistant software with run as administrator.,the software may not have permission to write and save data.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is happening to every computer in the world that has the windows 22h2 build.,intel and microsoft seem to be sitting on their hands about it despite knowing that there's a problem.,"the 22h2 build has broken alot more than just that for many systems, so be thankful this is our only problem.",i eventually got it to work after changing the folder location and uninstalling dsa and then reinstalling it.,after multiple computer restarts it finally kicked in and started working again.,i made a new folder called dsa in my downloads folder and pointed it there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks for the suggestion, i did try this, but it did not change anything.",i also ran my browser (brave) in admin mode to see if it was causing the folder issues.,it did not change anything either.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for shedding some light on this.,is there a bug or forum about it on microsoftâ€™s tech site or intel forums?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i saw it on the intel forums.,their support was arguing with someone who claimed to be a setup technician who was having the same problem because it was doing it to him on every clean build of 22h2 he is currently trying to install drivers for.,i'm not going to post the link but the title of the forum thread is:intel driver and support assistant invalid configuration folder,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">intel driver and support assistant invalid configuration folder

found it.",thank you for your help.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you fixed the problem?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, i am even having issues logging into their community site.",it keeps sending me round and round.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so, i've now reinstalled and its working.",dunno what changed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nope.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, i just offset voltages until crash.",then obviously you have found your limit.,pl1 and pl2 is contingent on your cooling potential to be honest.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"only really need to undervolt for the highest applicable clock multipliers, where it's needed most.",using a fixed offset could drop voltages a bit too low at idle.,"i found setting the power limits more suitable than undervolting, let the cpu make its own decisions where a cooler system is the goal instead of peak performance and perfect benchmark scores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
-.2v or 200mv may be alot or it may be stable make sure to test with things other then cb23.,and with a negative offset i'd recommend you have windows on high performance mode or you are likely to run into low idle voltage issues if it down clocks at idle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s definitely not how iâ€™d do it.,i personally wouldnâ€™t be setting any power limits.,just lock the cores to the target frequency and lower the voltage in increments until it becomes unstable.,then just add a little bit more back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my motherboard bios comes with a 253w power limit on the cpu by default.,should i remove it?,(it's a z790 steel legend by asrock),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would remove all power limits and lock all cores to a fixed frequency.,then i would set the voltage to a constant value and keep decreasing until you have instability.,then once you reach that point increase the voltage a little bit to make sure youâ€™re fully stable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yep, flying an a380 this evening.",from the airport.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
get a 1660 super.,intels arc drivers are still buggy and have inconsistent performance.,the a380 is not a good card.,nvidia's drivers are way better and also the 1660 super doesn't need resizable bar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1660s is a lot more powerful, but is missing rt and upscaling support, if that matters to you.","that said, my a380 did surprisingly well for me when i was messing around with it in a few games.","it was even perfectly playable in sottr with the medium preset, + medium rt shadows, + xess, at 1440p.",but it's still an entry level card vs. an older low midrange card.,the 1660s should wipe the floor with it overall.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a 1660 super walks all over an a380, not even a competition",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"overall gaming usecase, i'd say 1660s.","for android emulator, if you're in a region where [google play games for pc](https://play.google.com/googleplaygames) beta is available, arknights should be able to run well regardless of both gpu.","don't use wsa though, that one currently has terrible gpu performance where i can run arknights at 300-600mhz on google play games with rx 480 while wsa stutters too much even at 1300mhz",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1660s, it's just the better card.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1660 super hands down,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
generally u want to go nvidia if u are looking to emulate anything.,a380 is too new imo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
try a new beta driver.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just bought the graphic card so i installed the latest drive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the normal certified one from october or the beta in november?,"i'm on the latest beta and no issues, had zero from any of them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think it's the beta from nov but i was thinking that maybe im going to need to do a re instalation of windows, cuz my old gpu was an nvidia so maybe thats gonns get the job done",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
try ddu first.,https://www.wagnardsoft.com/content/display-driver-uninstaller-ddu-v18058-released,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
agreed.,do the duu first and do a fresh install of the latest november drivers.,they seem to be the most stable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did it and its still freezing.,i guess i should re install windows on my pc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if that don't, then something is boned.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it fixed it, so i guess something was messing with the control panel of intel, but i will never know what was it i guess",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, use contact frame.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no offense, but not only should you get a contact frame, id try remounting.",during gaming your thermal throttling?,thats more of a mounting/cooling issue.,the contact frame took off 7-10c during all core cinebench (253w limit).,why get a 13900k and limit it to 150w?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you sure something isnâ€™t wrong with your cooler mount?,"iâ€™m running arctic freezer ii 360, 253w power limit no thermal throttling no matter the workload",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this sounds like a bad mount and or bad thermal paste application.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
forgot to mention i do actually have a contact frame as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the reason i am power limiting is for power efficiency and to keep things on the cooler side as i live in a apartment on a second floor where during the cold months it gets really warm indoors.,iâ€™m probably going to look into a different cpu block.,i currently have the xc7 and clearly it is not working properly for contact.,any block recommendations?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m only using an aio so i am not the best person to ask about that.,but if you have a custom water cooling in your rig and your thermal throttling thatâ€™s definitely a big issue,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fixed by reinstalling all killer related drivers & running an sfc scan.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what does the motherboard manual say about this process?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gpus draw graphics.,cpu does everything else.,one thing people often forget is that current games are designed for current hardware.,they are relatively small.,you have maybe a couple dozen ai entities and only a few objects you need to compute physics for.,in the future when people have on average more compute power that enables game developers also using it more.,and in simulation games it enables more complex models.,games are designed for the hardware the customer base has.,future games will be larger and heavier to compute.,so more computing power keeps the cpu competitive longer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cpu is the one that need to feed the gpu with drawcalls.,"so, cpu with weaker ipc means less drawcall.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you might get higher fps if you also upgrade your gaphics card.,but.,newer cpus are t he reason why our 1% and .1% lows are so high/good.,the higher those are the smoother the gameplay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if youâ€™re doing high end gaming these new cpus (alder lake, raptor lake, zen 4) are pretty much required.","the new gpus are pushing frames that pre-2020 cpus canâ€™t keep up with, especially when you add raytracing in the mix.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> i thought that today's gpus were taking a lot of the calculations off the cpu so it didn't add a lot of a build other than socket/motherboard/ddr5 upgrade.,"gpus are getting so fast that even current gen cpus seem to be having trouble keeping up with resolutions lower than 4k, just look up rtx 4090 benchmarks, but to be fair, the rtx 4090 is a ridiculously powerful gpu that's basically a high refresh rate 4k gaming gpu (with exceptions for *some* games)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on the game.,"in racing and flight sims the cpu has to do all the physics calculations and they can be quite demanding, especially in single-player offline sim racing, where the cpu has to process the physics of the ai cars too",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks, had no idea.",hard to keep up with changes in where bottlenecks are.,i have a 3080 and haven't settled in what cpu to upgrade to.,very excited but gpus just keep getting more and more expensive.,no plans to upgrade to rtx 4000 series...maybe 5000 series lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ok, i have the coffee lake processor.","i didn't think it was old enough but now seeing the comments, i will look forward to updating it.",i'm not the most intelligent when it comes to how all these components work so this is helpful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"depending on which 10th gen cpu you have, it is probably still fine and you can wait 1 or 2 more gens.",but even 13th gen has a good jump in performance.,"it also depends on what graphics card you have, and what resolutions and fps you want to push.","the higher the fps, the more calculations the cpu has to do.","so for example 4k, where the fps is quite low (unless you have something like a 4090, lol) the cpu has an easier time",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"at some point, some aib will make a single slot a380, and hopefully one without a completely pointless 8 pin connector.",the thing only uses like 50w at stock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"good to know it is only like 50 watts, and i really just want it for av1 also i don't mind the power plug as my pcie lanes are near maxed out with one more gpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, you can't even set it to use more than 66w.","it's a great low power card, and if you're only using the encoder i imagine you can turn the power limit down even further.","but even as a gaming card, it's not that bad.","i expected it to be awful, and it's not great for sure, but it's not actually horrible either.","for 1080p and on a very tight budget where you don't want to take a risk on a used card, it's pretty nice tbh.",it can even do rt in sottr at 1440p with the medium preset and xess.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"â€œnote: intel(r) chipset device software uses an unusual date 
for the devices it is targeting.","the date 07/18/1968 is

first time using windows?,"this has been like this since windows 2000.

spoiler alert: plenty of 2006 dated drivers in windows 11 by microsoft too",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"since english is not your first language, i'll reiterate my point, which is not that there is an old date on the driver, but rather that the date has significance as being the day that intel was founded.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you would definitely get much better frametimes with those cpus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"any modern cpu will see a substantial lift to overall performance, but it will help especially with 1% lows / stutters / frame dips.",nothing wrong with the 12600kf.,pretty sure you'll be very pleased with the performance uplift.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"by the way, does smart access memory works with amd cards on intel platforms?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you have the thermal headroom try overclocking first otherwise i would recommend an upgrade to a 12600k as it would be a nice pair with the 6700xt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i know that my 8700k is at least 20fps slower (best case sceanario) than 12900k at 4k.,so at your res i guess the diff would be larger.,the 8700k is only 1 year older than the 7700k so it should give you an idea roughly.,i have used the 12600k what a fantastic little chip that was.,i built a pc for him and he had a strict budget.,but the 13600k looks just as good if not more so.,at 1080p a lot of the grunt work is done by your cpu and gpu.,as you go up in res the cpu does less and less.,so if you are more than happy to  continue at playing at 1080p then a cpu upgrade (which will also mean a motherboard upgrade) would certainly help  your setup in better framerates and also when the frame drop hits be more consistent and smoother.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if your budget is limited, then a core i5 12400f would be a big improvement.","if you want to spend more, then your choice depend of the games you play, and you should check online tests.","some games don't care about e-cores, some don't care about big l3 cache, some prefer amd or intel microarchitecture etc.","notice than modern processors have adjustable tdp, so do not be afraid of a 250 w tdp, you can change this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
perhaps wait for the i5 13400?,i'm in the same boat as you and i'm patiently waiting for the i5 13500 early next year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

they are mostly close in average fps.,"in 1% and 0.1% lows, the 8700k is significantly better mostly due to the additional cores and threads.","per techspot: 

> [remarkably we see an almost 30% improvement in 1% low performance when comparing stock performance between the 8700k and 7700k.","then once overclocked that margin increases to 37%, so clearly as games become more cpu demanding, the 8700k will become considerably faster than the 7700k and more importantly, provide a smoother gaming experience.","](https://www.techspot.com/review/2068-intel-core-i7-8700k-revisited/#gaming_performance)

this will result in frame drops and stutters, which is what op is referring to, and your experience will be significantly improved over op's because your cpu has 1.5x the cores/threads and less stutters.","i wouldn't say you guys will have a comparable uplift, op will have a much more dramatic improvement than you did because their cpu is much worse.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"13th gen runs 5 to 10c hotter as it pulls more power and it has higher frequencies so this results in more performance, 13th gen will be absolutely fine if you use it for gaming, if you tune it then you should even be able to do get very similar stock performance with lower temps.",also a contact frame should help with temps.,"if you can i would say get 12th gen for now as the 12700k will not be fully utilized by the 3060ti in gaming (i think), and later on after a couple years then you can upgrade to a 13th gen cpu and continue till you want even more performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"why ycbcr explicitly, why not just rgb?",hdr is independent of this and independent of color depth.,its just that intel tries to enable 10 bit color depth when hdr is active.,but only if there is enough bandwidth left and everything supports 10b.,"previous generations of intel igpus did not give you control over color depth or format and chroma subsampling, but alder lake has added controls for both.",but only for native hdmi ports.,"but i believe manufacturers still need to ensure the signal quality for hdmi 2.0 (tmds 18g) ports for this to be available, same as with dp hbr3 speeds or maybe even with an additional converter chip (i was sure there was an intel igpu generation with completely native tmds 18g output, but the alder lake specs say it still requires the pcon chip for the full tmds speed).","and yes, i can force my hdmi monitor into ycbcr on my native hdmi 2.0 (tmds 18g) port.","intel said this will not work via dp-hdmi adapters and it does not for me (but may only be a driver not hw limitation, not sure.",intels specs say the formats are supported on dp as well by the hw).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"update:  
ok, so i have learned a couple things.","i have been able to test this laptop with its iris xe graphics on a 4k tv that a desktop computer is successfully connecting to at 4k@60hz and 4:4:4 (though rgb doesn't work, it's not really needed as 4:4:4 chroma subsampling is enough).","using the same hdmi cable and tv input that this desktop computer is using, this laptop cannot match the desktop computer's settings using the hdmi connection on the laptop.","namely, it can do 4k 4:4:4, but only at 30hz, or i can do 4k at 60hz with only 4:2:0 compression.",it can't do 4k at 60hz and 4:4:4 (nor rgb).,"using a thunderbolt/usb-c to hdmi dongle adapter (this one: https://www.amazon.com/dp/b08mswmxt4?psc=1&ref=ppx\_yo2ov\_dt\_b\_product\_details), this laptop is able to connect to the tv as i need it to without issue.","same tv input and cable, through the dongle, and this same laptop hits 4k@60hz at 4:4:4 color easily.","perhaps this is expected, or this is a bug.","either way, i was able to get my requirements out of this laptop via the thunderbolt connection.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it was my understanding that straight up rgb wasn't an option for 4k@60hz for bandwidth reasons.,"thus, chroma subsampling (ycbcr) is used.","there are 3 variants of this, 4:2:0, 4:2:2, and 4:4:4, with 4:4:4 the only one that can guarantee clear text, which is important to my use case of having the tv be my pc monitor full time.","somewhere i found a bandwidth chart of all the various options vs the 18gb/s of hdmi 2.0, but i don't have time to retrieve it right now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am having a similar situation with a hp elitebook 840 g8 (intel iris xe) and my hdmi 2.1 cable + lg c2 is only able to muster 4k@120/60 at 8-bit color depth.,nothing i do can get it past 8-bit 4:2:0 chroma.,"i do have 2 usb-c thunderbolt ports, and i am thinking about buying the adapter you posted and seeing if my lg c2 can do better than 8bit 4:2:0.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so 3840x2160 8b rgb is still within tmds 18g, just barely, but it is.","actually, ycbcr 4:4:4 takes up the exact same amount of bandwidth as both have 8 bit per channel and 3 channels, leading to 24 bit per pixel.","4:4:4 is actually no subsampling, just a different coordinate system for the same colors.","also ycbcr always uses the limited color range 16-235 (instead of full range 0-255 within each 8 bit value), which makes it slightly less precise.","with rgb, limited color range is optional and only needed by terrible tvs.",ycbcr actually is only useful for chroma subsampling and various compression tricks used in video encoding.,"which is why the tv world is using it, as basically all the picture sources, such as broadcast tv, video files, bluray disks internally use ycbcr and chroma subsampling already, so one can save bandwidth on the hdmi cable that one can then use for 10 or 12 bit color depth used in hdr.","edit:

since gpus calculate in rgb, converting to ycbcr is an additional step that only makes sense if it is the only thing your screen supports or you want to use chroma subsampling.","with most video players on pc, you cannot even prevent the conversion back to rgb.",so even a video file in ycbcr would most likely be converted back to rgb and then back to ycbcr again  by the gpus display outputs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's great info.,thanks.,i have my home desktop computer (rx6800xt) plugged into a 4k tv and i can only get 60hz with subsampling.,rgb drops to 30hz.,"i don't really care, i just want to know if it's even possible for the iris xe to hit 60hz and have small text readable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then you are probably somehow limited to a tmds 10g connection (effectively hdmi 1.4).,"&#x200b;

have you enabled whatever mode your tv needs to allow the full bandwidth?","most tvs have some option for this, often not very obvious.","or if its an older tv, maybe you used an input that is limited to the slower speeds?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, thanks for that, but i've gone through all of it.","it's just, i think, a fact that this setup doesn't quite hit the theoretical maximum, probably because no setup actually does.",anyway... none of this gets me any closer to knowing what this laptop chipset can do...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this not true in general.,"if you can find no other resolution etc.that surpasses the 10g limit of hdmi 1.4, then you are surely limited to that.","either by the monitor, the hdmi output or some sort of software bug.","&#x200b;

but hitting 4k60 8 bit rgb is not rare on actual hdmi 2.0 (tmds 18g hw capable) ports.","i have multiple monitors that do that here (4k tv, 2 dell desktop monitors with hdmi inputs) and i can drive this resolution from 10th gen uhd graphics via usb-c-hdmi adapter, alder lake uhd graphics via native hdmi and alder lake xe graphics via usb-c adapter or either of my nvidia gpus (one maxwel, one ampere).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most prime errors i've had over the last ten years were bad ram or bad bios settings.,"faulty cpus are rare, never had one that worked well enough to boot but failed stress tests.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

faulty ram?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my 12700k was dying on stock at prime95 when it exceeded 87 c for prolonged period of time - just rma it.,"still, prime95 is a terrible stress test and it's better to use r20/r23 mixed with geekbench instead.","though given uncharted crashes, did you run a memtest?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sounds like a faulty i7 honestly.,iâ€™d get a replacement.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, it looks like it was a motherboard problem.","to be honest, i was convinced the cpu was faulty, but i was able to test a gigabyte aorus mb and everything looks ok; i can run forever prime95 without any crashes as expected.","i havent still tested gaming, i'll do an update.",never though the mb could cause something like that.,"i removed the cooler and pasted the cpu on the faulty mb several times just in case, so i discard any problem rlated to that.",thank everybody for your help,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it should be totally possible to overclock to 5 mhz, actually its running its boosting to 4 gigahz out of the box.","you cannot overclock on b660, some support baseclock oc but im not sure if this one does",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i don't think 5mhz is possible, since the lowest my 12600k ever went was 499mhz",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

9900k definitely limits the 3090 in simulators even at 4k.,"the 13700k heat output is only ""extreme"" in highly parallel apps but is ok in games.",i'd say splurge for the i7 if you can.,option 2 is wait until january ces and see what amd offers (or doesn't) for vcache ryzen 7000 chips.,flight sim loves the 5800x3d.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that does not change the fact that his graphics card is being bottlenecked by his cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 13600k probably only gets 90-100 degrees under certain all core loads like cinebench.,gaming wise the all intel cpus are equivalent in temps or cooler than amd.,also the 5800x3d gets to 90 degrees stock.,and that just playing cod and spiderman.,literally happened this week to me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, that sentiment is overblown.",these new 13th gen cpu's only get to those extreme temps under synthetic loads or really heavy video encoding.,in gaming and day to day use they run extremely cool.,i'm running the 13900k under a noctua nh-u12a and in day to day use it barely breaks 40c.,i can get it to hit 90-100c if i run cinebench on it and leave the power limits completely open.,i dropped the power limit to 250w and it barely hits 80c in the same test.,single core performance is just as fast as it was before the power limit too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

raptor lake is officially known to be very hot.,even the i5 13600k is doing 90-100 on an aio.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"mine is only marginally lower, maybe 5 degrees less on corsair capellix h100i liquid cooler.",debating on undervolting but i'm a newbie  when it comes to that and i wouldn't want to lose performance..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"force the intel power limits.seems to be the usual ""fix"" if you're getting high temps (which is basically everyone with these new cpu's)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seems high - to me.,i ran a 13700k in a modified lianli 205 case with a nh-d15 for almost a year.,"granted, i was always undervolted by 0.05v, but my temps while gaming would hover between 60-66c.",prime95/etc testing would push it to 85c.,"unfortunately i can't tell you what temps i got stock, as i simply don't remember what temps i had w/o the undervolt.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that temp is on the high side while gaming.,i have a 13900k which is a hotter cpu runs at around 60c when playing cyberpunk.,but i have an aio,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah the issue has been discussed on chinese forums for a while.,"from what iâ€™ve heard, with b660 mobo it would be hard to undervolt without losing perf since cep has been introduced since 12th gen. if you are on a z690/790 mobo thing is much easier",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13700k came out last month.,how could you have been running it for almost a year?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"you're right; i meant to say ""1 month.""",(i ran the nh-d15 with a 12700k for a year before this),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not at all; only lower temps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

my concern is performance numbers vs clock speeds in overclocking.,"now that is dumb, actually the whole thing acts oddly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

since when?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all you have to do is update to a current bios and update the me firmware (thatâ€™s a separate process).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i donâ€™t know what you mean by risky.,just go to your motherboard page and see if there is a bios update for 13th.,if there is then yea it supports it and like the comment above me update internet me firmware and update bios,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"so you would update the bios (in my case asus flashback) without the cpu in, and just the 24 pin.",then after booting into windows update the me firmware?,or is the me stuff required to post like the bios,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

update: successfully installed my 13700k and its working perfectly!,tad bit warmer than previous gen but the performance improvements are there!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s good to hear!,i just updated the bios and me firmware and so far so good.,"had to follow a few extra steps to get the me done right so i hope itâ€™s ok. in regards to the firmware section on the asus page, i have downloaded the relevant file and followed the steps.",i am just not sure if its done anything.,how can i confirm its been done?,is the firmware update necessary for intel 13th gen?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

awesome!,glad to hear it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the me firmware update is done in windows.,as far as i know you need the me firmware update as well as the bios update for your motherboard.,"i have not yet seen any post on any forum where a z690 user dropped a 13900k, 13700k etc without the me firmware update.",although i am happy to be proven wrong.,but once everything is done i am sure you will be happy with the way it runs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i already have a 12th gen chip laying around so i am not too sure in your case but this was my process: 
1. download and install new bios on my z690 board 
2. update the intel me firmware (had to follow a few extra steps because it was being weird) 
3. install new chip and hope that it boots :) (i am still waiting for my 13700k so iâ€™ll let you know once i have got it!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"both the 13600k and 12700k will provided a good uplift depending on the game your playing, even at 4k.",i would go with whatever one is cheaper.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just get whatever is cheaper, there won't be a big difference at 4k if at all",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what games ya playing?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the advice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
*noticeably faster with a 4090 at 1080p.,i can guarantee that there is no difference in real gaming scenarios at 4k or even 1440p between those 2 cpus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"forget about 90 degrees being any problem, at all.",that is a fine temperature.,"the thermal ceiling for all 13 gen cpus is 100 degrees so they are designed for keeping up with 100 degrees continuous use, if sufficiently cooled.",you can evet set it to go beyond this guaranteed temperature in the motherboard (where it throttles)  which is by design since they have been cautious with the headroom so that it runs 100% stable at 100 degrees.,the thermal paste won't melt.,nothing bad will happen.,so 90 degrees is really a good temperature.,seen many be content with a nh-d15 cooler and 88 degrees cinebench.,setting it at 85 is maybe even more safe (for overall temperature in the case).,"this ""keep it at 70-80 degrees"" is a temp goal from much older architectures.","the old core2 quad had a 85 degree thermal ceiling and in that case trying to keep it below 80 (or more like 75) is more rational...

well i don't say you are not right but i preffer my pc with 12600kf staying nice and cool without having to suffocate in summer and still giving maximum performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you have any suggestions for a cooler for it?,i saw you mention the the peerless assassin 120 but i was wondering if air cooling or aio would be more beneficial for cooling?,"for reference, i have an nzxt h510i case (infamous for terrible airflow) and was wondering what would be better?",i was originally looking at 5800x + arctic freezer ii 280 + a new case (fractal design meshify 2).. thoughts?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, that's a different thing though.",i am assuming normal 20 degrees room temperature.,if it is summer and you have a very warm room (bad cooling in the room hehe) then it will be a different story for that time of the year.,but then again i use my pc the least during summer and most during the dark winter nights (here in sweden).,"another thing is, the measures for superpi or cinebench are total extremes which you almost never reach even pushing the cpu quite hard.",(for me the hardest usage is for daw:s in music production and gaming.,"the former much more taxing than the latter)

so my reasoning is that if you can keep it below 85 (or even 90) that is the worst case stress test scenario that will never reach (or just occasionally reach for short times) with more normal  hard usage.",and that temperature in turn is 10-15 degrees below the thermal limit of the cpu.,so there is plenty of headroom for a vast amount of time anyway.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in addition to my other reply (about summer temperatures, headroom etc) there is a very interesting read here about how different the newer intel cpu:s handles temperatures:

""while in the past a cpu hitting its peak temperature was cause for concern, enthusiasts are going to have to learn to accept high temperatures as â€œnormalâ€ while running demanding workloads with raptor lake and ryzen 7000 cpus. ""","""furthermore, intelâ€™s i9-13900k supports adaptive boost technology (abt), which allows core i9 processors to dynamically boost to higher all-core frequencies based upon available thermal headroom and electrical conditions.",this allows multi-core loads to operate at up to 5.5ghz if the necessary amount of thermal dissipation is there.,"**this feature works in a way that actively seeks high temperatures: if the chip sees that it is running below the 100-degree c threshold, it will increase its performance and power consumption until it reaches the safe 100c limit, thus sustaining higher clocks (and providing better performance) for longer periods**""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i mean, even if they wouldn't kill it, would there be any sense for it considering ssds got much cheaper and faster?",maybe there are some niche use cases but i think it was one of the best thing that pat did.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
optane more broadly died because micron pulled manufacturing support and intel didn't have a convenient way to make it in-house.,"the choice was largely made for intel, not by intel, let's keep it real.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel started off as a memory company.,"optane had its load of own benefits, namely unmatched endurance and random read throughput, as well as no overheating under load and steady peak performance even when the drive is full and no need for slc caching during write operations.",todays nand flash based drives are only good at sequential read/write operations which most people don't rely on that often.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
?,normal ssds are still slower.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep consumer optane was kinda a swing and a miss.,you had to be on a z series motherboard and originally it only worked for boot drives.,so unless you had high end current intel and for some reason a hdd boot it was useless.,later they added the ability to accelerate secondary drives which made it somewhat useful.,but as ssds have gotten cheaper having a 1 or 2tb+ ssd game drive is becoming the norm.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>there be any sense for it considering ssds got much cheaper and faster?,maybe there are some niche use cases but i think it was one of the best thing that pat did.,this.,what are these people talking about?,before it's time?,no.,a little late?,maybe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the micron's lehi fab where 3d xpoint used to be produced was equally owned by both micron and intel, until micron decided to exercise their right to purchase the remaining 50% share of the fab ownership.",it is  that decision that actually killed optane as micron found themselves unable to maintain a 3d xpoint fab on their own.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i bought a barely used 905p optane ssd on ebay back in 2021 for $500ish.,it's the 960 gb pcie 3.0 variant.,"it can't keep up with fast samsung/wd gen 4 nvme drives in terms of sequential read/write, but it's still way faster in terms of low queue depth random read/write performance.","&#x200b;

sequential performance is heavily advertised because 7000 is a big number,  but this spec is overrated imo.",random 4k q1t1 is the metric most enthusiasts should be looking at when comparing ssds.,"[tweaktown's samsung 990 pro review](https://www.tweaktown.com/reviews/10226/samsung-990-pro-2tb-ssd-higher-level/index.html) did a good job of bringing this up, as seen in [this screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/ozbwcww.png).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but have more storage for the price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the optane 905p ssd shown on this picture was a consumer class drive.,what you're describing is *optane memory* used as a cache drive which isn't the same as *optane ssds* which are the full fat 3d xpoint storage that work on any platform.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>later they added the ability to accelerate secondary drives which made it somewhat useful.,"thatâ€™s what i got it for, it wasnâ€™t easy to set up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with the prices for the space of the full fat optane drives i always considered them above consumer grade.,but i guess your right and they technically are consumer ssds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep it was a pretty unpolished process.,was fun to play i even liked the pre optane ssd cache feature that intel had but then removed on optanes launch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can see them as the hedt version of storage.,half way between consumers and professionals.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah i like it though, i forget i even have an hdd till i am opening my drives to do big file dumps.","i guess the problem for me is i would probably have never done it on my own, i lucked into a free hdd, it went out and was still in warranty and instead of sending back a 4tb one they sent back a 6tb, it wasnâ€™t a hybrid or anything so buying the optane to accelerate it made sense and actually has really helped.",i could see why it be hard to keep such a niche product on the market though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep i guess partially what led to their death is how fast and cheap nvme 3 and 4 drives have become.,they lose in latency compared to optane but greatly beat it in price to speed and capacity.,and since most consumers are not ultra latency sensitive it's a premium that doesn't matter for most.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea i had a hell of a time getting my old module to work with my brothers 11400f build and gave up.,it just didn't want to detect the optane drive as an optane drive.,it would show up as a blank drive and nothing i would do be it running the clean command is diskpart or anything would get it recognized.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's true.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"omg the process was crazy, you had to change things in the drive, you were optimizing in settings i hadnâ€™t used since windows xp, then change the optane drive, then i had to go in a flip things around in the bios.",iâ€™m not an it professional by any means and itâ€™s honestly a miracle i didnâ€™t brick my computer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you'll be fine.,better vrms are for overclocking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thanks!,"a sigh of relief, really.",thought i was gonna spend on a z series board ;0;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh, k series cpus are still best paired with a z motherboard.",and thereâ€™s good reason for that.,but they can work okay on better b660 boards.,"with that said, there are plenty of b660/h610 boards completely incapable of powering a 12700k or better even at stock levels, never mind overclocking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i keep seeing people recommending z boards for k cpus, but with 13th gen intel, does it really still apply?",there is really no point anymore in overclocking for average joe.,"in case of 13600k for example, you get max 1-2% increase in gaming performance, while using 50w more.",thats not a good deal at all.,"in productivity, you can gain more, but again, is 5% performance gain worth all that extra heat and electricity?","i think good b660 boards are perfectly fine for most users with this gen, unless you specifically need some fancy feature only z board offers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
100% this.,have a 13700k and a msi z690 edge and recently got the b660 aorus master on sale.,"with a 5.5p/4.3e@1.31v oc on the z690 vs the b660 stock made no difference in gaming (control, gow, infinite, tarkov, doom, etc).","in fact at stock on the b660 my frametimes were better by 1-2ms, it ran cooler (obv), vrm temps are lower, etc etc.",imo overclocking 13th gen is pointless for gaming.,and you should only attempt with a very good cooling solution - 360 aio as a minimum.,"i originally went z690 + 13600k oc, but am now using the b660 + 13700k stock and it runs faster, cooler and more smoothly, so i think it's the perfect middle ground.","you can also remove power limits with a b660, which gets you 90% of the performance of a moderate manual overclock.",edit: get a contact frame for sure - lowered my temps by 4c / 8-10c at idle / gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i didnt know that there is an updated version for 12th gen, sounds nice to have.","if the support is there, i may grab one as well.",then.,i'll have the excuse to grab a beefier psu with pcie5 spec knowing that my 850w will not be sufficient for tec cooler when paired with i9 and 4090.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"single core is more important for gaming so i would do that

but because you mentioned that its a alienware its probably throttling anyway (watch gamersnexus's videos on it lol)

what cooling does the cpu have?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ofcourse the cpu has watercooling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you have a link?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so if single core is more important for gaming, should i set the cpu affinity to only one core?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i'd wait, i am on a 10900k my self.",i don't see enough now to upgrade for me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if i were in your situation i would wait until i decide to get a gpu.,at that point i would be looking whether amd or nvidia gpus offer more performance for my budget.,then i would look at cpu benchmarks of the i5-10600k where they test with a low rendering resolution to eliminate gpu bottlenecks and then at corresponding benchmarks of your chosen gpu and see whether there is a significant difference in fps at my resolution (in your case this would be 1440p).,keep in mind that the games that you play should be a deciding factor.,if i were then dissatisfied with that performance then i would go looking for a cpu upgrade.,"&#x200b;

it could be that when that time comes for you that amd would already have released something like a ryzen 7 7700x3d or intels 14th gen has been launched.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so you are grilling your cores on a constant 1.35 vcore?,on idle?,"the temp is ok, usually an air cooler can't even keep it at/below 90â°c and more likely always hit 100â°c on cinebench from what i have seen.",also if you only do gaming on it you will never hit these temepratures.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to be honest iâ€™m a little confused how itâ€™s running so hot with e-cores disabled.,"granted i havenâ€™t used an air cooler in years, but my 13900k at 5.6ghzpcores all cores enabled, and 4.3ghz ecores all cores enabled can go on a 30 minute cinebench run and hit 85â° max temp while iâ€™m using a liquid freezer2 360mm radiator.",you only have 8 cores enabled and have heat that crazy?,have you tried reseating your cooler and making sure the contact is sufficient?,nhd15s are powerful ass air coolers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there are only 2 real ways to do what you're asking, once you've reached the limit of cooling capacity of any/given air cooler:  undervolt, underclock...or both, otherwise switch to aio.","taking ambient temps and case/fans outta the equation, once your nh-d15 or equivelant reaches its efficiency limit there is nothing more that you can do with it.",there is no magic trick.,"either reduce the load, or find a better cooling solution.","while i don't have the 13900, i ran my 13700k on nh-d15 comfortably for close to a year.","i got the ""temp bug"" again recently, and finally decided to dip into aios...for the hell of it really, but also b/c i wanted to see how much better one would really be vs the good old air cooler (not matter which one, as nh-d15 and a couple of others are top of the line (read: end of the road) for air coolers).","arctic freezer ii 280mm aio dropped my idle temps by 8 degrees, and my cinebench temps (for example) also dropped by 10-12c.","so, again, if you want to stay with your air cooler on that 13900k either endure the limit of it's performance capability, or reduce thermal load (read: cpu performance).",good luck.,\-99,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this case has relatively bad airflow.,"i would try to 

- remove front panel to improve airflow,

what are your vcore and such at.",and what kind of case are you using??,"&#x200b;

and yeah the fact you have your p cores clocked same as mine (no avx offset right) and all 16 e-cores enabled which take the same power as 4 p cores as 4 e-cores equals space and power of 1 p core running cooler.",though you have a liquid cooler.,but still an additional 16 e-cores to cool and 5c lower temps.,"&#x200b;

and is it possible the noctua cooler is wearing out like maybe the cold plate is not as good after moving it between systems despite cleaning it with rubbing alcohol and a lint free cloth each time?",?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have the front panel on, but the mesh one and i removed the dust air filter.","&#x200b;

i am trying a different 13900k hoping it can run 5.6ghz e-cores off at a lower vcore than 1.35 fully stable and thus lower temps.","&#x200b;

i would go up to an 8-core personally.,it's just the more logical step to the next requirement level.,"that said, unless you got a stellar deal on that i7-11700k, i would stick 12th or 13th generation intel cpu or go zen3, which has stellar deals.","for your reference, i'm on an i9-11900k.","i chose it, due to the excellent price with motherboard and free games.","the minimum requirement i had was 8-cores, so this fit the bill well.",i wouldn't pick up 11th gen without a heavy discount.,"otherwise, it would be zen3 or 12/13th gen intel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
honestly not sure but my 8700k still kills it in gaming with my 1080ti or 3070ti.,maybe id see an increase but anything at 1080p is hundreds of fps.,1440p to my x34 monitor is like 90-110fps with high/close to max.,personally i bet the 3060 would be a bottle neck before a modern 6core cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"in general, 6c12t is fine.",depends on what your doing.,are you a data scientist?,engineering?,"no, then you'll be fine.","i'm still running a i7 8700k (from 4-5 years ago), it has 6 cores, 12 threads.","it \*was\* cutting edge, and still feels solid.",i have it overclocked to 5.0 ghz.,its running solid at this time.,"i was thinking if upgrading was going to be necessary, but i don't need more cpu power.",i want gpu power for games (my 2080 is feeling slllllloooooowww).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

>no such things as future proof.,this continues to be an incorrect claim by people who just dont know better or are just happy to spend the money to upgrade every two years so they dont care.,"there are times or areas where future proofing isn't a concern, but for a cpu - something that many people will likely want to have for 4-5+ years - yes, where demands are heading in the future should absolutely be thought about.","if you're smart, informed, and sometimes just a *bit* patient, you will absolutely be able to get better longevity.",and this extra longevity can provide compounding value because you will have better/more powerful options(at the same price) once you do need to upgrade again as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i just got my build together about a week ago.,it's been a massive improvement for me as well.,last build had a 2700x that was bottlenecking my 3080 a bunch at 1440p as well.,literally tripled my fps in spiderman with rtx on.,"i could have gone for the 5800x3d too with a bios update, but i also really wanted to make a new build with a new case and everything.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you don't think it's a good concept.,you just said as much in what you wrote.,"if people can't anticipate how their use cases evolve, then it's a bad concept.",you just told us all the reason you think it's a bad concept.,it's bad because people can't anticipate how their use cases will evolve.,that's the reason it's a bad concept.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it depends.,i see people posting a 350$ bundle of the 12700k with a z690.,it makes a lot of sense to take the 12700k at that price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thereâ€™s a massive difference between 11th gen and 12th/13th gen. those 11th gen cores are much weaker than the newer cores.,11th gen actually even performed worse in some games than 10th gen did (and 10th gen was similar in performance to 9th gen).,"since your question asked about future proofing, thereâ€™s absolutely nothing future proof about the terrible 11th gen. the cores are more similar to e cores than p cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yes, 11th gen is comparatively weak and hot vs 12&13 gen cpus.","i have a feeling that prebuilt companies are trying to dump stock, but i havenâ€™t checked the prices theyâ€™re asking yet.","the absolute minimum you should think of is a 12400f on the current socket, which i think is lga1700?","only 12th and 13th gen cpus will work on those motherboards/sockets, but the performance jump is worth it alone.","also, anyway you can work your way up to like a 3060 ti?","better value, if you can find it at msrp",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"12th gen celeron has about 30% higher per core performance than a 10900k, so yes it is.",10th / 11th gen cores run very hot for very little performance compared to anything from ryzen 5000 onwards.,"they are not worth buying no matter how high the discount, right now you can get 12th gen stuff for cheap as its all been discounted after 13th gen came out.","i mean you ask for futureproofing, anything from intel 11th gen and below is already obsolete compared to 12th gen. the difference is that big.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

err... yes there is.,there's a pretty huge difference between 11th gen and 13th gen in performance.,when 11th gen launched it was a huge flop.,slower than 10th gen in some regards and got absolutely slam dunked by ryzen 5000.,"12th gen was a gigantic step forward, and 13th gen takes that even further.","just look at these benchmarks, the 13600k is roughly 25% faster than the 11600k in [gaming performance](https://tpucdn.com/review/intel-core-i5-13600k/images/relative-performance-games-1920-1080.png), and is around 60% faster in [application performance](https://tpucdn.com/review/intel-core-i5-13600k/images/relative-performance-cpu.png).","i'm sorry, but how on earth is that ""not that much of a difference""?",and there's also the fact that 11th gen is on a dead platform which has pretty much no upgrade path without requiring a motherboard change.,and its also missing quite a few modern platform features,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i frankly don't think that supposed extra longevity matters much.,you either just okay with what you have or is not.,i think future proofing is to an extent a marketing ploy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

while i can agree amd is overpriced and has bad drivers (i came from a 5900x to a 13900k).,i will severely disagree with you that the performance is bad.,"the 7950x is a few percentage slower than 13900k depending on task..

&#x200b;

amd with zen 3 was a huge win in my book.",even intel 11th gen still couldnt beat it except very few applications.,and 11th gen came out after zen 3.,"&#x200b;

as for your ending rant, the new gpus are phenomenal (if charts are accurate still need to wait for real benchmakrs/reviews) because its price to performance will be extremely good.",while it is only the 4090 is has a good price to performance.,"&#x200b;

because they can control exactly what they want in the design.,a general x86 processor makes different tradeoffs.,apple doesn't have a license to produce an x86 chip.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"single thread performance between base zen 5 and 4 will be around 25-30% higher, with mt being well over 50 percent higher.",zen 4 with 3d v-cache will be about 15 percent more for single thread performance and they already said gaming performance will be around 30 percent better too.,so zen 5 will definitely be about 40-50 percent better for gaming and overall should be a 30-50 percent performance boost in general compared to zen 4. then when we get zen 5 with 3d vcache??,bro intel wonâ€™t be able to compete.,amd is moving to having p and e cores for zen 5. their e and p cores will completely dominate intels e and p cores.,intels e cores are weak asf.,zen 5 ecores are going to be on par with zen 4 and then their p cores will be on the new 3nm zen 5. the jump to this architecture will also mean higher core counts too so theyâ€™ll match intel with that.,anyone who thinks amd is lagging behind is false lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thatâ€™s only after the energy is spent to convert the instruction so itâ€™s still more energy on average.,itâ€™s pretty well documented there is a (now small) die size penalty for x86 doing the translation.,the difference in efficiency of arm isa vs x86 is probably only on the other of a few % today (thanks to advanced design techniques and modern node processes) but itâ€™s there because of 1970s design choices on x86.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"you are right,but only because of the terrible amd pricing.",personally i dont get it.,amd price their cpus like intel did not exist.,"that helps intel because reviewers compare 20 thread cpu against 12 thread.. if the 7900x for example would be same price as 13600k, the cards would change completelly.. there is no technical edge on either side.. it is just about the pricing.. where intel is very aggresive...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

amd reportedly have two cpu design teams leapfrogging each other.,each team does a pair of generations - the 'new design' and its refinement.,the odd zen generations being the 'new design' and pair generations being the refinement.,zen 1 & 2 got designed by the original x86 zen team.,zen 3 and most probably also zen 4 were worked on by the original amd arm k12 team.,this means zen 5 has been in hands of the original zen guys for some time.,linkedin pointed to the chief architect of zen 2 being appointed for zen 5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

also no bro do some research.,zen 5 will use zen 4 cores for the e cores and zen 5 cores for the p cores.,worst case scenario they change that and make the ecores similar to zen 3 which still shits on intels ecore performance.,zen 4 already beats the best intel cpus in terms of single core.,it just falls behind in multi core due to intel using a shit ton of ecores to boost their core count.,you know how week intels ecores are?,theyâ€™re literally comparable to gracemont cores from half a decade ago.,"so weâ€™ve got a zen 5 8900x with 8 zen 5 p cores and letâ€™s say 8 e cores, with zen 4/zen 3 levels of performance, vs an intel 15700k where their e cores still lose to intel 10th gen in terms of performance.",and all the reports already say zen 4 with 3d vcache will be 20-40 percent better depending on what youâ€™re doing.,"so going from that to a huge architectural shift, moving to 3nm which is huge compared to 5nm, and matching intel in terms of overall core counts, with the only major difference being amds e cores shit on intel in terms of performance then yeahðÿ˜‚ expect amd to dominate again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

apple does not care, and they care about battery life as a selling point.","it's not like your going to be gaming on that laptop, so that is instantly 80% less benchmarks anyway.",the software advantage of apple really is only under its own products.,"the moment you start using 3th party software, your battery life is going to suffer more.","because again, less control over the software.","i still see programs putting tasks on the main cpu cores, that needed to be on the efficiency cores.","because well, companies can not be bothered.",but you can have a m1 experience with just getting a good tablet these day (that cost 1/3 apple product).,"if you're not running specific software that needs x86, even android tablets are good little development machines.","external keyboard, mouse, desktop mode en voila.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

mainstream intel/amd laptop cpus expect a fan in the laptop.,they expect to be able to run at 15w-28w as required.,they have aggressive boosting and boost to 30w or even more.,"they almost always attempt to give best performance

m1 and to a lesser extent m2 is *exact* opposite of this in every way

consequently, it would be more appropriate to compare something like n6000/n6005 to m1/m2

as much as youtubers would want you to believe, battery life is not a characteristic of cpu or isa and is heavily influenced by things like display, ram, modem, etc., *especially* as cpus are able to exist at lower and lower power levels [something something amdahl's law something something].","comparison of battery life of 2 laptops may be a comparison of the displays, ram, modem, etc.","in the laptops

when i say better i mean faster.,you can easily confirm it by looking at single thread benchmarks.,"geekbench, passmark, cpu-z, they all confirm that raptor lake has superior single thread performance compared to zen 4. and from the die shots you can see that the raptor cove cores are wider than zen 3 and zen 4 cores.","here's a single thread list from passmark if you are curious: https://www.cpubenchmark.net/singlethread.html

13900k scores 4710 on average, while 7950x scores 4299. so in this specific benchmark the 13900k has 9% better st performance.","results vary depending on the benchmark used, but the 13900k outperforms the 7950x in every popular st test.",it proves the individual cores of raptor lake are superior to zen 4. multithread performance is another story.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

zen4 performance was right on the money so i disagree with your comment on it.,the discrete graphics cancellation is still up in the air so you have a year or so to say if he was wrong and i will eat my words.,raptor lake delays isn't his fault when intel can't keep a proper timely for any of their products.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> , but imagine how energy efficient apple's little (e) cores on 5nm must be.",extreme efficient but dog slow.,like in mwatt range but also like 10 times slower to do tasks vs the performance cores.,"a main gain is 5nm for their performance cores, no turbo boost (that alone easily saves 300% power vs x86 turbo boosting cores).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's not worth arguing about a less than 5% improvement in gaming performance.,the lead is usually better in games that are already running at over 200fps.,even in competitive titles i don't see a reason why you should be concerned about 200 fps vs 210 fps.,even the bests gamers cannot perceive such a difference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
raptor cove cores also consume less power in st workloads compared to zen4.,so its a win in both fronts.,considering the node disadvantage it's quite a major feat for intel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i watched all his videos about arc as i was really rooting for intel to be successful in gpu department as i am fed up with outrageous gpu prices and sub 200 $ segment seems to be dead now and i want more competition in this regard.,i was really sad to hear that arc has been cancelled and fortunately this didn't turn out to be true for good.,so you are wrong.,he predicted this thing wrong.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
he first said intel is canceling all discrete graphics.,"then when people started debunking that he said some mobile graphics will remain but discrete graphics is ""effectively canceled"" then when intel released statement debunking that then he said future iterations of discrete graphics like battlemage and celestial are canceled.",then there were a bunch of people with credible sources in intel came out and said all that is hot crap then he went silent acting as if he didn't say anything.,"then he also said raptor lake is delayed until 2023 and then changed it to raptor lake mobile is delayed until 2023. then he said raptor lake will only do a paper launch with ""no real availability"" and then he went silent about it.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"here's my story, i recently built a new 13700k system and i have literally installed and reinstalled win10 and win11 like 5 times trying to spot core utilization differences among other things and honestly i can't really see where one os manages my apps and programs better than the other.",i've actually found that my performance has been better with win10 than win11 believe it or not lol.,"what i can say is this, win10 does manage the e-cores but there are some differences that the thread director on win11 does slightly better like automatically learning core prioritization which is convenient.","while using win10 it is strongly recommended that you edit your power settings in the control panel and switch it from ""balanced"" which is default to ""performance"".",they say this does a better job prioritizing your main apps on the p-cores while still leaving those background apps on the e-cores.,i recommend leaving all cores enabled and if you run into any issues with a certain program bouncing off the wrong cores (not common btw) then you can adjust the priority level for that application in task manager.,i am a productivity user and gamer so i tend to float between these 2 worlds daily and i've found that win10 is still the sweet spot right now.,i really do like win11 but the bugs (especially with 22h2 build) are still annoying and can degrade some gaming experiences with random stutters and fps drops.,"this can potentially be managed by disabling core isolation/memory integrity, tpm,  or in some cases disabling resizablebar.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"update:

&#x200b;

i tested win11 and yes this is very true.","&#x200b;

cpu-z single thread score with all e-cores disabled was usually 875 and rarely 913 running multiple times.","when i turned even 1 e-core on, cpu-z single core score was always 913-914.","&#x200b;

in win10 it did not matter.",cpu-z single thread score was always 914 whether 1 e-core on or all disabled!!,this was after multiple cpu-z benchmark runs.,"&#x200b;

so no need to worry and no issues on win10 and i can happily keep all the e-waste cores disabled and have a super powerful 8 core 16 thread chip most powerful one at that (better than amd 7700x clock for clock) with no hybrid crap on the way on my win10 os.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why would you buy a 13900k just to disable the e cores?,"at that point just buy a 13700k, the only benefit of the 13900k is the extra e cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i would agree.,it seems those rumors are from win11 being a crappy os.,"&#x200b;

or maybe just fear mongering from the anti- disable e-core crowd trying to convince everyone to never disable the e-cores even if we simply do not want them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no l3 cache is reduced as it is shared among all cores.,"&#x200b;

the l1 and l2 cache is private and only accessible to the core in use.",so disabling the e-cores should not take any cache away from the p cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well the extra 6mb of l3 cache, and that could be huge for games down the road.","&#x200b;

and i got a good deal at my local micro center for only $549.99 which is way below what it is selling for elsewhere.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 13900k also has higher single-core performance  .,.,.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it's the same architecture, just clocked higher, and you can oc to achieve the same clocks",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am not discounting him.,but want to know if anyone else can see the same experience.,i have not heard this from anyone else.,i tested myself with 13900k turned on one e-c0re and cinebench r23 score and cpu-z score were exactly the same.,so i do not see the issue.,"&#x200b;

though could that not tell the whole story.",so what is the deal.,is it only a win11 thing.,is it only their configuration??,"&#x200b;

is there any noticed behavior as i do not want any e-cores on in my win10 install.","&#x200b;

with win11 no choice due to thread director and problems potentially even on 12th gen, but i am staying with win10 a long while anyways.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"maybe i missed something, but in your op you were originally talking about the performance penalty of having zero e-cores enabled, but now you have switched gears and are talking about results with 1 e-core enabled.","on my 13700kf, with all e-cores disabled i am seeing about a 5 percent performance hit in single-thread.","with 1 e-core enabled, the performance is about the same as having all the e-cores enabled.","so it seems that for the best overall single threaded performance, you need to have at least 1 e-core enabled.",it appears that one little e-core is assisting the p-core in that regard.,here are my quick cpu-z benches (windows 11).,"cpu-z benchmarks will vary a bit run-to-run, so i have recorded the min/max ranges of 5 runs each:

1 or more e-cores enabled, single thread: 895-920
all e-cores disabled, single thread: 830-880

all e-cores enabled, all threads: 13100-13230
all e-cores disabled, all thread: 9070-9180",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes that is what i was talking about single threaded performance.,"&#x200b;

it is puzzling how e-cores could assist p cores in single threaded performance.","&#x200b;

though with win11 it looks like it is a thing likely and perhaps because of this info here:

&#x200b;

[https://fox-laptop.com/pc-components/cpu/core-i7-12700k-review-revealing-that-e-cores-hurt-p-cores-but-without-them-everything-is-only-worse/](https://fox-laptop.com/pc-components/cpu/core-i7-12700k-review-revealing-that-e-cores-hurt-p-cores-but-without-them-everything-is-only-worse/)

&#x200b;

which applies to 12th gen too.","&#x200b;

well you are using windows 11 and it appears you are getting similar results to falkentyne over at [overclock.net](https://overclock.net) where there is like a 10s of points single core speed reduction.",falkentyne is also using win11.,i tested it with win10 and cpuz score was 914 at 5.6ghz p core with 1 e core enabled vs all e-cores disabled also 914. i have not yet tested it on win11.,"&#x200b;

and your score is varying even with e-cores on or off for single thread.",is yours a dynamic clock left to boost and not static.,i have mine static manual fixed at 5.6ghz all p core and getting only 914 in cpu-z single core score.,"&#x200b;

what i was trying to get at is maybe falkentyne on to something claiming that e-cores being disabled somehow for some unknown reason hurts single thread perf of p cores due to redesign of raptor lake to allow ring to clock higher with e-cores enabled and perhaps there is something to it with 13th gen universally on all os????",**or maybe just findings with win11?????,"**

&#x200b;

it appears its your findings with win11 as well.","&#x200b;

i need to find win11 22h2 to test it with and see.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got somewhat different results with cinebench r23 compared to cpu-z.,all of the test results were within roughly 1 percent of each other.,"here are my single core results on my 13700kf with 2 runs each of cb23:

one e-core enabled: 2211,2205 

all e-cores enabled: 2209,2214

all e-cores disabled: 2189,2187

when all e-cores are disabled there was a very slight decrease but we are talking 1 percent, so within the margin of error.","to answer your question, i have my p-cores setup in turbo ratio groups in the bios.",group 1: up to 2 cores will run at 5.7 ghz.,group 2: up to 6 cores will run at 5.6 ghz.,group 3: up to 8 cores will run at 5.5 ghz.,i have all the e-cores set to 4.4 ghz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes your scores were within margin of error and on win11 the cinebench single thread score was within margin of error no e-cores vs 1 e-core on.,like 2215 or 2207 or something.,"&#x200b;

but cpu-z a different story.",1 e-core on cou-z single thread score 913-914 multiple runs.,"all e-cores disabled, almost always 875 though one rare run it hit 914. so there is a thing to it with win11.","&#x200b;

now in win10 all e-cores disabled cpu-z single thread score always 914.",1 e-core enabled always 914.,"&#x200b;

thee tests were all p cores statically set to a fixed 5.6ghz.","&#x200b;

so it appears issue of disabling all e-cores creating weird single or slightly more threaded issues and strange behavior reducing performance even as an 8 core 16 thread cpu should behave is a problem with win11 and not win10.","&#x200b;

probably because of win11 being thread director aware and 12th and 13th gen thread director does not know how to behave with the e-cores all disabled.","&#x200b;

but win10 is not thread director aware so the thread director is effectively not being used and thus no issue disabling all e-cores for win10

yeah.,as i wrote i also had weird problems applying changes.,hwmonitor did show offsets but the behavior could just go back to stock when i did changes.,then needed a new reboot and the settings were actually taking effect in practice.,but now they just work like this even if i reboot etc.,its just when making changes that it was unreliable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
glad it helped :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hey!,i havent really touched the pl settings at all just voltage.,i would assume that the time setting doesnt matter at that point.,for a simple undervolt i would just suggest applying -100 in the core offset in the fivr menu but that still just makes the wattage a stable 230 at 100% all core workload.,havent actually checked the gaming wattage much.,on wattage limit settings i have no info yet as i havent tried them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hey!,cant remember sorry :(.,i distinctly remember seeing something resemblibg turbo enhancement or something like it but cant remember where.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the exact difference?,no.,all i can tell you is to just play with a negative core voltage offset in fivr menu and see what happens.,for me it never broke anything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ok heh.,well this has been a confusing couple of days.,thanks for the info :).,i agree that the e-core offset doesnt really do anything as i was just testing there.,setting a separate ring offset did effect voltages tho.,i could not get the voltages to budge under 1.27 with just the core offset.,"ring offset finally got them to 1.245.

but i havent tested ring invidually without any core offset so i will do that tonight to see if thats the only thing i really need to adjust.",edit: not saying youre wrong in general but this is the behavior i observed so something wonky going on there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

let's simplify the computer into a single bus system.","in reality they probably have multiple busses at different levels and all kinds of abstractions but let's forget that for now, it doesn't matter for the explanation of what bar is.",devices in a computer are connected by the system bus inside your processor package.,this just means a lot of wires that go through all the different parts.,"every device in the bus has an address, which is some binary value sent in a special address bus that controls which device listens to what data.","some of these addresses refer to you computers main memory, some to different bios or other low level features and some to your pci(e) devices.",this direct addressability of pci(e) by the cpu is what makes it so fast and versatile connection protocol.,bar or base address register tells your system which addresses refer to the memory or io capability of the pcie device.,"in x86 computers setting these registers happens by bios during boot time, however the system which negotiates the size of the address space (i.e.","how much memory or io the cpu sees in the device) is very simple and can only set sizes that are power of two (this is why data center gpus often have 32gb, 64gb or 128gb vram that is entirely mapped by default, no need for rebar).",with gaming gpus.,"traditionally and for compatibility reasons, they have used relatively small address space window and the gpu then handles the question of moving the data to correct part of vram.",this way they can handle any vram size but it also mandates moving data from cpu to gpu in well planned chunks to avoid too much overhead from managing the vram.,it hasn't previously been an issue because gaming gpus had relatively small memory and the data assets moved were relatively small.,now games use huge graphics assets and lots of data streams in and out of the gpu all the time.,"resizable bar enables the operating system renegotiate the size of the address space, setting the gpu address window according to the actual size of the vram which removes restrictions in how the data should be handled to avoid overheads.",it doesn't automatically make things faster but it helps in avoiding a lot of unnecessary optimization.,p.s.,i am not entirely clear on how the vram management and communication with cpu works in all situations.,"but finding anything in google seems to be impossible because no matter how i try to define the question all the results are just ""what is vram"" and ""how much vram i need to get 60fps"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if you have a recent gpu with 8+gb vram it wouldn't hurt to enable it.,though most software lacks the optimization to get any real performance gain from it for now.,also it will put some extra pressure on the pci-e bus so you could get some distortion if you have a low quality pci-e extension cable/riser at 4.0 or 5.0 speeds at worst.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hi, can i piggyback on this to ask the following

i buy parts once and want to keep my build for say 7-10 years (i don't play much nor competitive, hell i barely have time to play)

would you think that 13700k can carry me longer (1-2 years more) than 13600k?",or in 7-8 years they will both be 'equally slow to run the system' so it won't really matter which one i have?,"i'm typing on a 10 years old laptop and i am fed up by the fact that it freezes even with just windows and firefox open

my use case is relative lightweight (ms office, some games offline, no editing, nor streaming) but if the i7 can carry me few years more i can afford it

on the other hand if the additional 2 pcores will not make a meaningful difference in the long run, it's 100â‚¬ wasted...

i'm really on the fence atm - thanks for your input",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i don't own this cpu but according to [ark](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/230496/intel-core-i913900k-processor-36m-cache-up-to-5-80-ghz/specifications.html) this frequency is only reachable if you have thermal headroom, i think it's defined <70c but not sure.",otherwise it's 5.4ghz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as far as i know (i donâ€™t own one so please feel free to correct), 5.2ghz is the correct all-core turbo speed for the 13900k.",5.4ghz is the less-than-all-core turbo speed.,"5.7ghz is the preferred 1/2 core (turbo max 3.0) turbo, and then thereâ€™s 100mhz on top of all of these if tvb is enabled and the cpu is below 65 degrees.","so, if everythingâ€™s enabled and stock and you monitor general system usage for like an hour, 2 cores should hit 5.8ghz and the rest 5.5ghz, just not all at the same time.",a run of r23 should stabilize at 5.2ghz without hitting any throttles.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mine is the same.,set optimised defaults and muticore enhancement turned off in bios.,cinebench score 37800. hwinfo says i'm pulling 253 watts.,"pcore goes to 5.2 all core and e cores at 4.1
package temps after 10 mins is 87 deg with no throttle.","i then set pcores at 5.5, e cores at 4.4. and ring at 4.6 with negative vcore offset of 0.08. pl1 and pl2 set at 285watts.",i score 40600 after 10 min run of cinebench.,package temp is 92 deg with no throttle.,"i have a rog strix z690 i gaming mini itx board and 32gb ddr5 6000.

would ne nice to score around 40s at the 253watt power limit like others.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you have stock settings (mce off and intel adaptive boost off) then it should start out at 5.5 p core and 4.3 e core.,after 5-10 seconds it goes to 5.1-2 p core and 4.1-2 e core.,if you have intel adaptive boost on which is usually default on motherboards it should be 5.5p core 4.3 e core unless thermal throttle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are hitting the power limit and throttling.,stop using fixed vcore.,set svid to typical or power saving.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, temps get to around 88c after long benchmarks.",i have done some more fiddling and can maintain almost 5.4 average p core and a bit over 4.2 average e core after applying a hefty offset.,core vids and vcore read about 1.20-1.21v with a -0.110v offset in xtu.,"seems that i should have been getting the full 5.5 before the offset though, since i wasn't throttling?","i throttle with unlimited power, getting to 99-100c.","although i do recall sometimes where hwinfo throttle flag is 'yes', but the max temps never broke like 87c, so maybe i am throttling?",i just figured the sensor was getting erroneous data.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
perhaps my temps instantly shoot past the threshold.,i figured as long as there was enough voltage/power and the cpu wasn't throttling these speeds were attainable.,i can score around 39.2-39.3k with my 1.2v fixed vcore and -0.100v offset at 240w pl1 and pl2.,just seems strange that going to higher voltage hurts my performance so much that all cores downclock 300-400mhz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks.,"perhaps everything is normal then, and people i have seen saying they got stable 5.5ghz all core at 253w were actually unlimited?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> (i donâ€™t own one so please feel free to correct)

this is incorrect.",all-core turbo ratio is 55x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you using a fixed or adaptive vcore and what voltage?,maybe our chips just don't tolerate much voltage.,seems so weird as most of the overclocking guides i see are running 1.35-1.45v on the 13900k.,performance is much worse for me at those voltages.,at 1.45v windows is buggy and i can't drag windows around.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
somebody else suggested it only boosts to those speeds if you have thermal headroom.,i would think i do since my max temps in these scenarios are about 88c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"right, i can hit 5.5 all core with more power, but it seems a lot of people can do it with 253w, so i was thinking maybe it was voltage or something else.",perhaps my chip just needs more power than others.,is svid the same as sa vid?,"not sure i have seen svid in bios, but i will look.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
technically speaking you should get 5.5 with stock setup and mce off.,have you tried with sync all core 5.5 without the offset?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"then intel needs to work on their specs, since ark shows 5.4 as max p-core turbo, tvb should only apply at less than 65 degrees, and if every core is getting a 3.0 boost then wtf is the point of specifying it separately.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
speed only throttles at 100c.,if you arenâ€™t hitting that tinge.,you have thermal headroom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sa vid is system agent vid

svid is serial voltage identification and how the cpu communicates to the motherboard what vcore it should be getting.","svid option in gigabyte board seems to be under cpu/vrm settings

"i will have to check my bios, but i think that is what the results in my op are, all synced no offset.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not sure what's up then.,"runing cinebench r23 right now, cores sitting at 1.18-1.19v and i have a -0.10v offset applied, plus -0.01v at 51x ratio and -0.025v at 54x ratio on the vf curve.","so, this is pretty low voltage but increasing it at all just lowers frequencies.","i am currently capping power at 240w, max package temp reached 82 after 5 minutes, but i have done these same setting at 253w, no change.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks a lot for the explanations.,will give this a try.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
look for a setting in bios called intel adaptive boost technology.,if its on auto then that means off (usually means on though).,turn that on see if it works,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i looked for that, nothing by the name of adaptive boost though.",closest things are turbo boost maybe?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

lmao going all in with the motherboard and cheaping out on  ram.,hilarious.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wondering why you bought a z690 mobo.....you should have just gone straight into a z790.,the 13th gen cpu's minimum ddr5 support is 5600 by the way so don't short change yourself with 5000.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if i were you id upgrade that ram, that is very slow ddr5 ram.",if possible id get 6400+ ram.,also the 13900k going on sale is basically 0% chance.,but yes your upgrade will be awesome.,make sure you are on a fresh build of windows 11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6400mhz on the ram is a great start.,they are on sale for like 219 on newegg.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why would you buy 5000mhz ram?,at that point just get a 13700k and faster ram.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"everyone who is complaining about the ""slow"" ram [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ista56iaeva) shows how little difference it makes to pay much extra for so little gain.","but yeah imo that board is huge overkill, i got a z790 pg lightning for 230â‚¬, it is weird that you would ""waste"" so much money on a mobo but go with that ""cheap"" ram",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the z790 isnâ€™t worth the price increase for what it offers.,i can just update my bios and get the same performance and features out of a z690,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why win11?,i try to stay away from it with my 13700k pc that comes tomorrow for the sole reason that win11 is still so unfinished from what i have seen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you have any recommendations for ddr5 thatâ€™s not like 572626273 dollars.,"i know itâ€™s kind of weird that i would care about the price considering i brought an $800 motherboard, but ðÿ¤·â€â™€ï¸",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because 6000mhz+ ram is obscenely expensive and microcenter had a good deal on this ram.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea but people updating bios on some z690 boards are running into performance issues.,hope that doesn't affect you.,you're talking a $100 swing at most.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i dont know what you mean by unfinished.,but windows 11 comes with the thread director so it schedules each task to the correct core.,"gaming=p core, background task=e core.",windows 10 doesnt have that so if your gaming it might go to the e core and introduce latency or fps drops,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i just snagged gskill 6000mhz 32gb of ram for 200 bucks

seemed like a good deal to ne",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and why would you buy an $800 motherboard just to be cheap on ram.,you paid more for something that does not increase performance at all but want to cheap out on something essential ?,?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how much is the 5000 mhz?,bc you can get 32gb cl30 6000 for $200,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i literally have no idea what your talking about.,thereâ€™s really been no issues with win 11 except for a couple bugs (windows 10 had the same issues right at launch) and there is no 100% cpu bug or update lockdown.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sell it and buy better ram,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the microcenter promo is now 6000mhz memory with purchase of an amd chipâ€¦and isnâ€™t it kinda stealing to not return the whole package?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is latency as important with the ddr5 as it was with the ddr4?,i donâ€™t know what the baseline is for this generation of ram.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, they wonâ€™t take it back.",they said if i return it i would get 0.01 cent back.,i didnâ€™t steal it.,he let me keep it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

honestly.,the 10900k is still a really good cpu!,9900k is starting to show its age.,so the 10900k has at least 1-2 years left until it will be considered old.,maybe wait till 14 or 15th gen. iâ€™d say see if you can hold out til then because 14th gen will be a whole new socket so early adopters will have some issues out the gate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"went from a 8700k to a 13700k myself, noticeable difference in most scenarios really.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
weird flex just to play a low requirements games.,i still use an i5 4590k which ain't too shabby at all and instead of playing high end games even those from some years ago i play mostly card games like hearthstone and recently marvel snap,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why not the 13600k?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you havenâ€™t already-invest in a thernalright bcf-$12 and your 12600kf will last you as long as the 9600-and run cooler than with the oem socket.,and your cpu has o% chance of bending-and it wonâ€™t damage your mobo like the expensive thermal grizzly copy.,(yea the tg is a copy of thermalrights),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

should have gotten 13600k.,significant boost for gaming over the 12600k i believe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

absolutely will be.,i went from 4790k to 10700k in 2021 and it was a huge jump.,the core count and speed improvements make a massive difference.,13th gen is another leap beyond that.,congrats!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

probably more with amd (so i heard),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you play at 1080p i think judging by your other comments?,"1080p and under is the place where ram makes a difference, but its the same as 12600k vs 13600, you might get a 10 fps uplift with faster ram but only at 200+ fps.","when hitting 60-120 fps, and on higher resolutions, theres like a 0.8% difference between 3600cl16 and 6000cl32.","the lower the resolution and lower the settings is the only time ram matters, and its a very niche category for 240-360 hz e sports.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yep, thats exactly what i did.",my old 9600k was begining to struggle even at 1440p so i needed a big upgrade.,"i saw benchmarks and both 12600kf and 13600kf looked amazing, but did not justify spending â‚¬100 more for 13600kf because i play at 1440p with a 3070. by the time the 12600kf will struggle in games, the 13600kf will struggle too, so thats my logic here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why not upgrade when it will not do the stuff you want properly?,i mean its still a pretty new cpu released 2 years ago.,i would have stayed more with 9600k but in some newer games there were issues due to it being 6c6t and it was bottlenecking my rtx 3070 even at 1440p.,"but damn, 10900kf is a very solid cpu for years to come honestly.",just my 2 cents.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

absolutely.,when i had the 6700k it was bottlenecking me in warzone and apex so i switched to amd 5900x.,then ugpraded to a 13900k cuz i had issues with amd (the cpu itself is a beast though).,and man im getting huge gains in 1% lows and just fluidity even from the 5900x in general.,i cant imagine the initial reaction you would have when you upgrade your rig.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"god yes that cpu is really bottlenecking your gpu, not sure if you feel it but there are a decent amount of games that won't run smoothly with that cpu nowadays.",13600k or 13700k would be better value if you're just gaming though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you would have to replace the system.,"a prebuilt sff, even if it could have the cpu upgraded, is unlikely to have adequate cooling capacity or power supply to support a higher model cpu.",they tend to size what the system comes with very specifically to the stock cpu.,"additionally, bios support is often also limited to prevent you from installing a â€œtoo performantâ€ cpu that could damage other components.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

a sff system like that is going to have a proprietary motherboard specific to that series.,"even if you got another motherboard for the exact same series of computer, being much newer itâ€™s unlikely to be a perfect fit for an old case.","additionally, you would most likely still have to upgrade power supply, cooling, and memory.",so thatâ€™s like 75% of the entire system right there.,it is almost certainly going to be cheaper simply to buy an entire new/refurbished system.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"> so, does it mean that one core of 10th gen = 39.5% x one p-core of 12th gen?...","i'll leave this to everyone to judge and whether intel's statement is credible :)

your data proves intel is super credible actually.","that is, once you make the same comparison that intel is claiming.",intel is claiming that an e-core has the same 1t ipc as skylake (10th gen).,"from your data, we don't want ht/2t, but rather the 1p comparison 1.85x, or **54.1%**.","i've grabbed some easily accessible public gb5 results to compare with:

processor | clockspeed | score | source
---|---|----|----
12700k | 5.0 ghz | 1911 | [geekbench](https://browser.geekbench.com/processors/intel-core-i7-12700k)
10900kf | 5.3 ghz | 1377 | [geekbench](https://browser.geekbench.com/processors/intel-core-i9-10900kf)

using geekbench public data we can see the 10th gen processor is **72.1%** of the 12th gen. however the 10th gen chip is running at 5.3 ghz.",we need similar clock speeds with the e-cores because the question is ipc.,"linearly scaling that down ( * 4 ghz / 5.3ghz) the score would be roughly 1040. that would represent a relative score of **54.4%** for 4 ghz 10th gen vs 5 ghz 12th gen.


i guess *technically* 54.1% is worse than 54.4% :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">just an interesting thought: although intel claims that the performance of an e core is comparable to the performance of one core of a 10th gen cpu (i may remember it wrong though), the above test results show that **1 e-core â‰ˆ 39.5% x 1 p-core with hyperthreading**.","so, does it mean that one core of 10th gen = 39.5% x one p-core of 12th gen?...","i'll leave this to everyone to judge and whether intel's statement is credible :)

that's because they run at different frequencies, they have roughly similar ipc @1t.","gemini lake was already pretty close in terms of performance to skylake  in a 1t scenario, ex n4100 153cb vs 6y57 158.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel compared the performance to skylake.,so one alder lake e-core is approximately comparable to one core of i5-6600k.,raptor lake e-cores run a bit faster so they should be approximately comparable to i5-9400 core.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">so, does it mean that one core of 10th gen = 39.5% x one p-core of 12th gen?","avx is a lot slower on the e cores, so for avx heavy benchmarks like this they're not as competitive.","for the lighter loads, background tasks, etc which use few or no avx instructions they'll be somewhat faster than at rendering.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"e-cores don't have hyper-threading, so i am going with ht-off results.",each p-core gives 1906 points when average across 6 p cores.,each e-core gives 1089 points when averaged across the 4 e cores.,"factoring in the 25% frequency difference, the ipc difference is 40%.","the claimed ipc improvement is 18% and 19% from sunny cove and golden cove respectively, which adds up to 40% (1.18\*1.19).",all the numbers make sense.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if one e core thread equals 80% p core thread that's a good result i think.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
someone should benchmark an i7 9700 @ 4.4ghz vs the 13600k's e-cores @ 4.4ghz.,both would be 8c/8t setups with similar ipc on paper.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"such news, e cores being proven they're just a waste of space, as intel cannot handle power draw and goes for synthetic gains instead of using 4 more p cores to get higher performance :d. also, [there's a bigger test on 12900k](https://www.purepc.pl/test-wydajnosci-rdzeni-p-core-i-e-core-w-procesorze-intel-core-i9-12900k-z-pamieciami-ddr5-patriot-venom?page=0,3), all enabled vs all p-core ht on/off and 1 p-core + all e-cores ht off.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

nope both are skylake.,"the 6th, 7, 8, 9th and 10th gen desktop processors are all literally skylake.",they are all the exact same uarch with the exact same ipc.,intel likes to overload their naming of uarch and product.,6th gen was skylake the uarch and skylake the product/code name.,7th gen was skylake uarch but kaby lake.,the naming convention made a lot more sense when intel was doing tick-tock.,"the uarch is sandy bridge, but two products sandybridge and ivybridge, with the later â€œtickâ€ being little more than a die shrink of the same cpu uarch.","the wells (haswell, broadwell), bridges (sandybridge, ivybridge, and lakes (skylake, kabyâ€¦) are the same uarch and core names respectively.","with the death of tick-tock, this naming convention has since changed, core uarchs are all â€œcovesâ€ and products names are now all â€œlakesâ€ and donâ€™t match starting with icelake 10th gen.

anyhow, this is why the e-cores are compared to â€œskylakeâ€ ipc as thatâ€™s the last desktop uarch intel sold (ignoring rocketlake which was terrible).",[intel roadmap source](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_intel_cpu_microarchitectures#roadmap),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i figured that with the blower card there wouldnâ€™t be that much gpu air inside the case so that the aio could use the cold air.,now i see that it could just be sucking up the hot exhaust from outside.,i flipped it around and in a five minute stress test it didnâ€™t really make a difference so iâ€™ll keep it as exhaust.,"also, there are no front intakes.",it is a very small case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what i mean is that no.,of intake fans should be equal to the no.,of outtake fans and negative pressure has no relation with cleaning the pc.,imagine you are breathing in less air and breathing out more what would happen.,it's the same concept here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
funny though.,ran for 1yr without a contact frame on the nh-d15 and didn't give  a \*\*\*\*.,"now we're all about ""proper contact.""","lol  
but hey, if it works, if it helps - we'll take it (especially if it's only a few bucks to try, and no big effort).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you have equal pressure entering and exiting the case then you will have no moving air.,the only con to negative pressure is dust accumulation due to intake air bypassing air filters.,"so yes, there is a correlation between negative pressure and cleaning.",look up any video about the subject online.,edit- your breathing in and out example also is completely wrong.,if the exhaust fans donâ€™t receive enough air from the i take then it will draw air through gaps in the case hence dust accumulation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mainly bought it because i read a post by someone who was able to drop the voltage for their overclock after installing the bracket.,"theory is uniform pin pressure, but who knows for sure

was also hoping it would help my ram overclock.",it didn't.,but i can now at least boot into bios very easily with 4133mhz in gear 1. before the bracket it would hardly ever train.,still gives errors in testing so backed off to 4000mhz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had the nh-d15 and it was a beast.,i wish it would fit in this case but my ram is too tall for the second fan.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

w/o proper testing and thermal imagining we won't have 100% accurate answers, but aside from ""uniform pressure"" and flat-er ihs surface i can see how these frames also allow for greater heat absorption and dissipation due to greater surface contact with the ihs itself and the fact they're made out of aluminum (which isn't all that bad as a heat conductor).","either way, at least it's not some $50-100 snake oil, so i'll take  it.",\-99,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

didn't do this exact jump but i went from a ryzen 2600 to an i5 12600kf as soon as it launched.,it was a massive leap in performance.,from testing i've seen the i7 8700 performs similarly to a ryzen 3600 in games so upgrading a 13600kf with some fast memory would be a noticeable difference in a lot of scenarios.,if you're going to overclock then you can get a decent z690 (with bios flashback since at this point in time a lot of stock won't be updated yet) like msi pro a or tomahawk or asus tuf.,whether you want to go ddr5 or reuse your old ddr4 is up to you.,you would need to make sure you get the ddr4 versions of the board if you decide to reuse old kit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i would wait for the 13400 in your case, cuz of the gpu ugrade.",you could grab a 2060 with it for example.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not surprising to get that fps.,"cyberpunk is a hard to run game that does hit cpu pretty hard, and an 8600k doesn't even have hyperthreading.",but the 3060 is also partly to blame.,"it's not a very powerful card, relatively speaking.","barely outdoes the previous gen 2070

x99 works with specific 5xxx and 6xxx cpus only.,so obviously you would have to buy a new motherboard and possibly ram (since an old x99 system likely has 2133mhz or 2400mhz which will not work well with 12th or 13th gen).,"additionally, if youâ€™re buying new a 13600k would be better (and likely cheaper) than the 12700k.","finally, if you want to stick with your current motherboard you could put a faster cpu in, like a 6950x, but the cost would not really be worth it.","edit: there are also some now inexpensive xeons you can put in there if you need multithreaded performanceâ€¦ but the vast majority of them have horrible single core speeds which would make them very bad for gaming or general use, and the ones that arenâ€™t horrible wonâ€™t beat an overclocked 6950x (which can be had for a non horrific amount on ebay, but is still probably not worth spending money on).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think you'll kick yourself for not going ddr5 if you plan to stick with the platform for 3-4 years.,"on the other hand, the performance benefits of ddr5 are game and application specific, and performance can either be worse (very rare cases), or considerably better.","the benefit of going ddr5 is for the opportunity to upgrade to faster ddr5 in the future, if you feel you need to.",but there's nothing wrong saving a few $hundred and sticking with ddr4.,[you're looking at about 5% overall loss in performance](https://www.techspot.com/review/2387-ddr4-vs-ddr5/).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

with 13th gen i would recommend just going for ddr5 now.,if it was 12th gen i would say save a little money and headache and just stick with the ddr4.,but 13th gen cpu and motherboards are rated for stability at higher dram speeds so i think its not a bad time to jump in now.,"overall it will give you better performance than your current ram, but not by that much though.",but i can see that performance gap widening in some games in the future if you plan on keeping this build for 3 or 4 years so the ddr5 bulld is a safer bet.,"i'm doing the exact same thing btw, i have a 3080 and going to get a 13700k soon with a z790 motherboard with that exact same ddr5 ram.",planning on going with the msi mpg edge wifi ddr5 because i want white and wifi 6e.,but not in stock for 2 more weeks i think.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

kinda off topic but do u have a 1440p monitor?,"if so, what's ur fps looking like when u game, and on what settings?",:o,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"basically, there are two things that primarily limit fps in a game.",1) the cpu can deliver more frames per second than the gpu is capable of rendering.,"(ie high resolution gaming)

yeah im running a 1440p 165hz monitor.,"for competitive games mainly apex i set it to medium to high , im able to get 165fps locked.",as for single player game i usually max out most of the settings cuz im only targeting 60fps.,cpu wont matter if you run your gpu at full load.,my cpu utilization is sitting at 30-40% max while gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"also, most of my current chosen components are ddr4.",would 13600k be compatible with that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i never looked at your cpu z. i looked at your hw info cpu speed screen.,your current speed was 5.5ghz but your actual max boost speed was 5.8 ghz for the the p cores.,by default with the exception of p0 and p1 the rest of the p cores have max boost speed of 5.5ghz but yours is all 5.8ghz across all p cores which mean you are not running stock and with a power limit of 337w you are deffo not stock.,to claim otherwise is disingenuous.,claim what you like.,but in my view you are not a credible source so this thread no longer interests me.,had it been stock and legit i would be asking you for advice and whatnot.,but as it stand it just reeks of gimme those upvotes and silver awards,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ahhh i see lol.,i'm trying to figure out the fps i can expect for the new 4000 series laptops.,supposedly they have a 20000 multi core score from leaks so i thought maybe i could compare them but i guess that's just the cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"show me one person with 2 x 32gb sticks of dual rank with ""8400 stable""
i have a ddr5 setup also with 2 x 32gb dual rank sticks its good for 4800 and 4800 only
i mean yeah i can boot 5600 but its not karhu 30000% stable

maybe karhu 300% stable

the same goes for alot of people running 8400 and such it may boot but its not what i would call stable",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
high speeds are not as attainable at high capacities.,it's a lot harder to get 128gb 8400mhz than it is to get 16gb at 8400.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they show dual rank kits but all the images are of 16gb single rank sticks in asrock timing confirgurator and such

at some point ram will arrive that can do it dual rank ofc and by the looks of it that may be very soon
but its still a crap shoot with the imc and such

and anyway why are u all still harping on about ddr4/ddr5 this is about cinebench
geez man reddit at its finest

you all come in change the subject then sxxt talk for no reason

this post is for other users of 13900k's to compare i have no interest in playing with the window shoppers

and at no point did i say 4800 is the max maybe you should read what i actually said

and even if them dual rank a die sticks do turn out to be the magic bullet my pc needs for 64gb in dual rank
what should i do fire up my time machine and go forward a year to when i can actually buy them
then go back to november 2021 when i actually got mine and give them to myself?","i built pc 1 for a family member had murder getting it stable at 4800 with 2 x 32gb of ddr5  on release
i did what any person with a brain would do and decided to send my ddr5 board back and keep my ddr4 for another generation and run it as fast as i could 

and it was a wise decision my pc gets much better fps than the family members
if you guys dont like that i dont really care

maybe i would come close to my ddr4 fps with that a die or maybe i would only get it stable at much slower speeds due to imc problems thats â£600 im not willing to spend  for -20% to +5% until i upgrade again on 15th gen

lets face it to get the same gaming performance on the 90% of games that prefer latency over bandwidth as my tight sub timings 4100 gear 1 cr1 i would need something like 8200 cl30 cr1 yes yes i should roll the dice again 
pick up a â£600 ddr5 board then spend â£600 on ram then just hope it hits stupid speeds that nobody has been able to get yet on dual rank and that my board adds cr1 support for ddr5

i will get right on it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> lt with the exception of p0 and p1 the rest of the p cores have max boost speed of 5.5ghz but yours is all 5.8ghz across all p cores which mean you are not running stock and with a power limit of 337w you are deffo not stock.,to claim otherwise is disingenuous.,claim what you like.,"but 

did you not read my post stating unlimited pl..
you mean as i dont have prefered cores?","yes i allow all cores to boost at idle to 58x that means nothing as the moment there's load on over 2 cores the multiplier goes down

my prefered cores are core 5+6 not 0+1 btw

wrong.,intel pl1 and pl2 are 253w.,motherboards out of box without pressing anything in settings are releasing unrestricted power limits that are not what intel has in spec for 13th gen. and the tau thing yes you are correct on that.,they will boost however long they can.,but anything over 253w is not stock and is an overclock.,even intel themselves have said that.,donâ€™t confuse the 2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

wrong.,intel cpus have not followed pl1/2 since 95w days.,nor is it an enforced spec but merely guidance on how to design your power delivery and cooling solutions.,intel allows for motherboard vendors to design their boards to deliver whatever it can and run unlimited to the max cooling potential.,"out of box with my asus board and my dark board, both will pull whatever it needs to deliver the clocks provided the cooling is there.","that is stock behavior, and saying i need to go into the bios to limit this would no longer be stock as i am changing defaults.",the mce argument died with 12th gen when they fully removed any time limit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i dont care what you believe and i didnt say its limited to that but odds are against you due to imc and ram availability at that density and such

firstly he is only using single rank 16gb sticks
secondly dual rank is much harder to drive at higher speeds
and i can pretty much guarantee he isnt 100% stable at that speed

show me him running 30000% karhu and his voltages to achieve that

i am going on my experience stabalizing a 4800 set at 4800 with a 12900k and it wasnt simple or easy nevermind 8400",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no im saying its a lottery and in my case it was 4800max karhu stable, 5600 if you dont care about stable which most people here dont seem to care about

i can run this pc that im on now at 4400 ddr4 gear1 but its not stable so zero use to me 4100 is the max its 100% karhu stable",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wrong again.,alder lake 12th gen followed the pl1 of 125w and pl2 250w if you turn off the unrestricted power.,itâ€™s up to the motherboard vendors what they allow out of the box.,again.,just because intel allows the motherboard to unrestrict power does not mean it is stock.,it is still an overclock!,mce is on out if box not because intel has it stock.,because motherboard vendors have it on to give more performance.,stop confusing the two.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
his latest vid was 1 hour 20 mins stable (atleast).,do you really believe you need to reduce frequency by idk 2000-4000 to get it rock stable?,"i know he got 32 gigs here, but you are just so wrong if you think you can only have potato frequency with dual rank sticks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wrong.,changing values in the default bios is no longer stock.,"most users never enter the bios, too complicated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dude 1 hour 20mins?,"really that is not stable thats stable ish at best
i do a 30000% karhu run thats over a day for 64gb
i have seen fails 25k in

lot of piss in this post from that contest.,"to put this to bed, asus presents the following information upon installation of a 13900k after post:

i can agree with thatâ€¦but you can look at any scientific/professional tests/reviews and they all say the same thingâ€¦my thread was to help people deciding what cpu to buy if they are going to build a pc right now with all the options and different prices,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe i had a buggy alder lake chip i know it can happen on both platforms some will perform worse than they should..the 5800x3d is best for anyone with am4 for sureâ€¦and i stream and game so i like a few extra cores just donâ€™t need the extra i9 ones for streaming only at 250$ more also..i also play 1080p max fps but yea all newish cpus do very well compared to where we were a few years back,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea they have done good at gaming with decent wattage..i also wanted the i9 as thatâ€™s what iâ€™ve always gotten but this gen the 13700k seems to be the killer for max fps gaming if you donâ€™t need a bunch of cores for other stuffâ€¦just very glad to see it outperform the 12900ks by a good maragin as with the 9900ks vs 10700k the 9900k seems to come out on top in a lot of cases..decent generational uplifts and competition are great for the end user,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m not gonna delete it because im not claiming any tests or science..i have tinkered with lots of 12th gen chips just only owned one..and i was using a ks for a month or so..i diddnt claim for it to be scientific whatsoever just saying that they are noticeably more refined and run better out of the box,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the launch of 12gen was a bit of a shit show.,buggy bioses and ofcourse the issues with e-cores.,"if i had to reset my steam password for instance, the recaptcha or what it is called simply did not work, i had to use my 11gen system to do that as the bios for the msi z690 pro a would not allow me to turn the e-cores off nor could i reach higher speeds than 3200 with the first bios :p

find me a single reason why itâ€™s better for the price than a 200$ rx 6600.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
doesnt matter.,"u wont be hitting 250 watts in gaming, let alone 300+ enabled by mce.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for gaming i donâ€™t think itâ€™ll matter either way.,mce on will probably be a few percent faster though.,"technically if you wanted to change bios settings to make it as fast as possible in gaming(and only gaming), disabling hyper-threading will give you ~1-3% in some games and disabling the ecores will give you ~2-4% in some games.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't think its gonna make a difference.mce on or off the cpu is still gonna boost to 5.5ghz on all cores for stuff like gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"mce is basically an old term for boosting all core turbo multipliers (and other things, like voltages) now inappropriately applied to simple power limits.","intel wouldâ€™ve liked to call it â€œextreme performance modeâ€ with a limit of 350, versus 4095, which is basically just the maximum value the field can hold.",setting this number to a high value is pointless if the cpu is then able to greatly exceed your cooling capability and has to throttle.,the stock 253 is also likely well above what gaming would ever consume.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mce shouldn't be a feature that anybody uses.,it applies dangerous amounts of voltage for minimal gains and hardly does anything over stock settings.,"additionally with hundreds of pages of reports on the 13th gen cpus on other forums, very few people are managing to get a 5.8 all core oc on their 13900k's, so what exactly is mce needed for, and if it is somehow auto clocking to those speeds, how much voltage is it applying?","unlike xmp for ram, mce is not an approved feature, it is just for marketing from motherboard brands, likewise to gigabyte deciding to add an option for auto oc on 13900ks to 6.0 for 2 cores, as though every and any 13900k can manage that.",turn mce off and leave your cpu at stock if you aren't interested in manually tuning it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why does disabling e-cores have the chance to increase gaming performance?,i got myself 13700k due to reputable benchmarks like igors lab but start 2nd guessing myself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i find it so strange that the extra e-cores actually make gaming performance slightly worse,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
latency has a big impact on gaming performance.,"disabling the ecores ensures nothing ever gets accidentally tossed to one of the high latency ecores, as well as freeing up more cache for the pcores to use.","other things too, like theyâ€™re using up some of the thermal and power budget even when idle.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
higher ring clock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
latency has a big impact on gaming.,ecores are much higher latency than the pcores and use up some of the l3 cache.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">disabling the ecores ensures nothing ever gets accidentally tossed to one of the high latency ecores

when that happens micro stutters (frametime spikes) can happen.",it's why in some games you can fix stuttering by disabling them.,like i'm still hoping the scheduler keeps getting worked on but i still occasionally see a thread popping up of people noticing a smoother experience with them off.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

would be very interesting to see which one will be able to squeeze more performance out of a decent 2.2-2.4kg gaming laptop chassis between there and dragon range.,amd should scale a lot better above 60w this time at long last.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seems strange when 13900 is only 8 p cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
laptop benchmark results are directly tied to power settings.,we now have some preliminary leaked test results from some unknown laptop.,the comparisons of multicore performance are completely useless.,significant single thread increase was not expected as the architecture is very nearly the same.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

sounds like youâ€™re running with the initial drivers.,try installing the beta drivers.,this should fix your issues.,uninstall the driver (run [duu](https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-driver-uninstaller-download.html)) and install the beta drivers - [link to drivers](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/229151/intel-arc-a770-graphics-16gb/downloads.html).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"by all accounts, even overclocked it shouldn't be running that hot.",i would get a replacement if i were you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for the suggestion.,"i installed the beta driver, but the problem persists.","the card climbed to 90c and throttling kicked in, with fan speed still at 1000 rpm.","after running like that for 1 minute, i closed the game and saw fan speed immediately increased to 1200-1258 rpm, which persisted even minutes after the card had cooled back down to 50c.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, i'm considering it, but i'll have to wait until there's new cards in stock.",for now i'll just have to run it underclocked.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just curious.,does this also happen when you play a different game?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i donâ€™t have many games to test as i just built the pc.,"i tried overwatch 2 and deep rock galactic, covering both dx11 and dx12.","and yes, itâ€™s the same situation in both games.",edit: oh right i also tested doom eternal.,"the same happened there, with the only difference being i didnâ€™t even need to leave the menu for the card to heat up.","doomâ€™s menu is just more demanding, i guess.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
interesting.,do you have msi afterburner installed?,or any other type of gpu control software other than the intel program?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i do have afterburner, but i installed it after i found out about the fans, i think.","i wanted to use it to adjust fan speed, but it doesnâ€™t support the card and gives no reading on anything.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i was gonna say to uninstall it as it might be interfering somehow.,one last go run duu have it shut down.,remove the gpu and install it back in (make sure itâ€™s seated all the way).,install the power cables (make sure theyâ€™re properly seated).,load into bios and ensure rebar is on.,load into windows and install beta drivers.,once installed restart immediately.,if this doesnâ€™t work it could potentially be a hardware issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sorry forgot to mention.,make sure you run duu for every gpu you wouldâ€™ve had installed.,make sure you clear if all old drivers before installing the new intel beta drivers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

very unlikely for the cpu to fail just sitting inert but the motherboard it goes into may have drained its battery and need a new one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
few years no.,few decades a (still very) small chance.,mainly due to temperature changes causing expansion stress on internal components.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"unless it's exposed to humid air or something else that would cause corrosion and damage of the various metal bits, no.","if you think about it, it's a piece of glass soldered to a circuit board with some gold pads and a copper bit on top.",there's really nothing that will go bad unless we're talking decades.,i've got a few computers from the early 2000s that have mostly just been sitting around for 10+ years.,"they still work fine, which is somewhat impressive but not for reasons relating to the cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the only thing i can think of would be the thermal paste between the die and the heatspreader eventually degrading.,but my guess is we're talking decades at the very least before that would become an issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you a vampire who lifes thousands of years?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's completely normal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
65 is fine.,look at the power draw and decide.,power draw during gaming can vary widely.,worry when you get into the high 80s or low 90s.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's a good max temp.,enjoy your processor!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"cpu: i5 13600k,

2. changed the following under oc / advanced cpu configuration:
- cpu cooler tuning: boxed cooler
- cpu lite mode: mode 2 (default is 9/12)
- enhanced turbo: disabled

60-65 is fine for max temps lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you e got a peak power of 250w but temps of 101c and thermal throttling.,this indicates you're not cooling the chip adequately.,1) check cooler fitment and thermal paste application.,"2) check pump power and fan speeds, make sure they're connected and  running properly.",3) consider a contact frame to prevent ihs bending issues.,re test.,"a 360mm aio should cope with the 250w limited power no issues, temps might be high 80's to mid 90's but it shouldn't throttle.",from there you can work with undervolting/power limits etc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

lower the pl2 to 230w and see how that goes?,turn mce off.,adjust the pump/cooling in the bios or how even you control it.,pc case have ok cooling?,are all cores 100c?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my first language is spanish, sorry if iâ€™m misspelling somethingâ€¦ the thermal paste is very important in high end cpu because the thermal conductivity.",people tends to think if you use a cheap thermal paste it does the work and you will it to change often and thatâ€™s itâ€¦ and well thatâ€™s wrong.,it isnâ€™t only related to get 1-3 less grades.,"if you use a cheap thermal paste, you will get thermal throttling because the thermal conductivityâ€¦  and iâ€™ve made several test (not only watching youtube videos or reading stuff in reddit).",obviously check if everything is correctly connected.,"now, i have seen some scenarios with the 13900k, getting crazy voltages and that is related with the self moboâ€¦ so idk if you mobo had ia oc but at least for some friend it worked just this week that he built his 13900k pc.","if not, then try the suggestion of the people with the voltage stuff etc.",regards,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
okay lets start at the very beginning and once we got you dialed in you can explore further.,make sure enforce all limits is on.,the easiest way to do this is by usung intel xtu once you are happy with the settings 24/7 you can directly apply them in bios.,intel xtu you can change things on the fly.,go into advanced tuning on intel xtu and where it says core voltage offset enter something like -0.05v test it in r23 etc and if it is stable then you can proceed further to keep going until it is no longer stable.,the go back on or two settings.,like on my chip -0.09v is the best i can do at stock any more than that and it throws a wobbler.,once you find the nice voltage for stablility.,move onto the next part.,underneath there should be two options whihc is like turbo boost short power max and turbo boost power max.,this is intel referecing to pl1 and pl2.,so set it to like 253w.,what is happening i guess your cpu is boosting to 5.8 on a core or 2 and exceeding 250w whihc then drives the temps up to and beyond 100c.,the 13900k will hit this easily and then throttle the cores to 5.1 so basically you are running less than stock.,you can even do a 5.5 ghz all core and lose only like 150 points but still get more than what you are getting now.,becuase you are being thermal throttled.,but if you really want to go ballz to the wallz overclocking then the 13900k is far beyond any aio is capable of and even most basic watercooled setups.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lap that thing!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm getting 40.5k with some hastily applied kryonaut and a kraken z73, no special bios settings other than enabling xmp.",i'm sure you can get more out of that setup too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have a - 0.105v offset, best i can do for stability.","yet, your voltages are still lower than mine.",my cpu must be pants (13700kf),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it looks like you are doing everything right.,you shouldn't be getting that high temps and throttling.,i think something is wrong with your aio.,i would try reseating and reapplying thermal paste first.,"if that doesn't work, i would try another aio.",good luck!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
airflow is everything.,what case do you have?,edit: nvm saw adding the second 8 pin eps connector dropped your temps significantly.,i had no idea that would actually drop temps in any meaningful way with higher power consumption processors.,you learn something new everyday.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i posted the hwu video because it shows the rough difference between cpus clearly.,however i play it myself and can tell you 12100f or some of the other cpus will not hold those fps numbers in much of the city.,many games i've played starts easy on the cpu but put much more work on it when you get to mid/end game.,"gpu is the easiest hardware swap to make for most users and you can generally make big difference to how gpu bound game is in game settings, often not as much for how cpu bound game is.",that's why it's good to know how powerful your cpu really is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> i posted the hwu video because it shows the rough difference between cpus clearly

you posted a video which used an rx6900.",which is absolutely useless to someone trying to pick a cpu for an rx6600.,"i even covered this by previously stating that yes, a 12100 would bottleneck a 3090 class card, but if you're on a card below that, don't fret it.","even a 3070/3080 would be fine paired with a 12100

if the fps average of a 6900xt or-alike is 90, but a 6600 only gets 60 (as mine does in cp77), then there is no sample which can account for cpu bottleneck against the 6600 unless there is a cpu which also shows 60 on a 6900xt.","it's a balancing act, and that benchmark video is off balance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's a good thing to use a powerful gpu to answer a question like that.","so i will not agree that me posting that is ""absolutely useless"".","so it's not about you or your crush for 12100 but since you insist i'll just point this out

>even a 3070/3080 would be fine paired with a 12100


big disagree.","for many games that combo makes sense sure...
but it really really depends on the game and in many other games 12100 would be a heavy bottleneck for those trying to get some nice smooth fps.",don't underestimate how much gpu's can be tuned with game settings to bring more if you choose to compared to the cpu which is often more fixed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that much could be doable with e-cores.,"but without them you can get fairly close to the p-cores, which is the ""real"" limit for the ring.","depends on what you stress test with (as some apps are heavily dependent on cache and will be unstable at lower clocks), but even my 12700k does 4.8 ring while doing 5.1 on the p-cores.","those settings are only stable in-game and on the lesser demanding stress tests, but they do show that the (still somewhat practical) limit for the ring can be much higher without e-cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

am i?,no.,"i have 12700k and i look objectively, 15% difference isn't ""close"" (18% actually, when you consider 40k being the actual stock result), a close score is single digit, usually at around 5%, the extra cost may be for some unjustifiable and you're also at some very hefty overclock which require more expensive cooler, that add up to the total cost.","&#x200b;

that's fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea i dont think its an issue with the card its probably case airflow.,you probably have the aio in the front and those being the only fans to bring in fresh already heated up air.,am i correct?,if i am wrong then you need to rma the card not strap that cooler on it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

outlastâ€¦ no.,the absolute only place where the 12700k would â€œoutlastâ€ a 13600k is if you have a program that very specifically requires 7 or 8 p-core threads at 100% and for some odd reason the performance level of an e core would literally break the software.,does that really sound like a plausible scenario?,"people keep treating p-cores as the only useful cores and e-cores as literally useless, but there is basically no game where every thread is of equal and high-level performance.",is a thread not using 70% or more of a p core?,then itâ€™s likely going to do just fine on an e core.,"the 13600k is 14 core/20 thread cpu, and the 12700k is a 12 core/20 thread.","the 13600k has the benefit of increased ipc, bigger cache, better efficiency, and improved imc.","while i would not turn down the 12700k if it were the right price, and thereâ€™s no reason to upgrade from one to the other, the 13600k is the better cpu for the vast majority of users.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

unless youâ€™re running a database server serving tons of requests, the reduced latency - which yes, is quite a bit better - is not something especially noticeable during normal use, and kind of balanced out by the reduced performance elsewhere.","if your goal is latency and nothing else, then i guess it would make sense, but if the goal is balanced performance, i would say a good pcie 4.0 ssd - maybe even a raid 0 of multiple drives if you want to go wild - would be better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's very fast (ever used a linux live cd?),but disk persistence can be problematic.,the most useful configurations i've seen for ramdisks are temporary storage for high-io operations as well as a generic read-cache populated at startup.,configuring the system to load a few games (especially if you play them often) from disk into the cache at startup can help quite a bit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if your current mobo supports ryzen 7 then save yourself the cost of upgrading both.,my understanding is that the 5800x3d performs really well in specific games but is more than solid in all games.,13600kf might beat it in general use and many games but likely not by enough to scrap your current system.,it's your money though.,i just built a 13600k system but i'm coming from a laptop so didn't have another upgrade path fwiw.,edit: typo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"5800x3d cuz u alr have the motherboard, saved you a lot",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you should go with the 5800x3d since you already have a compatible mobo.,lga1700 is a dead platform anyway as 14th gen will use a new/different socket.,unless you can get a cheap/used z690 maybe.,your choice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

amazon currently has the 5800x3d for 329.00 so i'd go that route since you already have an am4 motherboard.,if you don't have some form of after market cooler i recommend at least something like a hyper 212 or comparable size for the 5800x3d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh alright, thank you.",i think i'll sit on the am4 mobo for a while and get the 5800x3d then.,it seems a lot better than websites like cpu benchmark make it seem.,thanks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, i'm gonna with the 5800x3d.",thanks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

go with the 5800x3d.,"your bottleneck will be with the gpu most of the time, especially if youâ€™re gaming higher than 1080p.","the 13600kf would require a new motherboard, and honestly if youâ€™re going up to a new platform it would be worth upgrading to a ddr5 board as well   (so in a couple years you donâ€™t need yet another new motherboard) which means youâ€™d have to upgrade your ram too.","instead of all that, just upgrade to the 5800x3d to max out your current platform, and when you upgrade from it, the newer stuff (am5 and lga1700, ddr5) will be significantly cheaper.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

a 12100 will definitely bottleneck it in a lot of games,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
processors from 12th gen and ryzen 5000 series won't be a bottleneck even 11th gen won't be a bottleneck to a 3080 at 1440p so you are pretty safe buying a 13th gen or ryzen 7000 series.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't shift to a 13900kf shift to a 13600k it would be a hell of an improvement over a 2nd gen ryzen.,13900kf is fast but not as much a fast as 13600k or kf that it is noticeable.,you can also switch to 5800x 3d just upgraded the bios on your motherboard and the 5800x 3d is a drop in upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

for 99% of people, an i5 is going to be more than enough.","even an i3 can be more than enough for the majority of people, especially if all they ever do is stuff like browse the web, check emails, etc.",it's not until you're trying to maximize multi-thread performance or want to max out every bit of gaming performance when you should consider an i9 (or an i7).,"a good example would be wanting to save time rendering, especially if it's something for work/making money off of.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the only real difference is the number of cores.,frequency you can adjust to your liking and the 13600k will most likely outclock the 13900k thanks to having less cores aka lower heat output which translates to lower operating temps.,13900k is only better when you need cores for productivity/rendering etc and even then a lot of stuff can be done on a gpu and way faster.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got a answer i9 can keep the value now the 10900k is even selling for more than 300,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for gaming?,essentially nothing.,for work?,a whole lot.,went from a 12600k to a 13900k and saw my workflow vastly increase (that and adding more ram).,people who buy the 13900k for just gaming just have to much money to know what to do with it.,"also, the newest i5 has more e-cores so i'm sure it's a beast for productivity at its price regardless.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for productivity tasks i9 is much faster.,they can do the same stuff just takes longer.,for gaming a bit extra fps and maybe higher 1% lows.,the higher the resolution likely the less fps difference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"productivity performance aside, 13900k (and more generally i9 vs i5 in the same generation) is usually quite a bit faster in gaming performance.","these differences are always downplayed because people think same architecture=same performance, but the i9s usually have much higher cache capacity and higher boost clocks/better silicon to support those frequencies",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most people that buy an i9 don't actually use it to its full potential and could have easily purchased an i5 (or in some cases an i3).,i went with an i9 on the 9th gen because my i5-9600k could not run my music production software (with all the vsts i need to have loaded) smoothly.,"for gaming, the 9600k moved my 5700xt at the time just fine.",could i have went to the i7 9700?,"probably, but i wanted to future proof a little more and i broke even on selling my 9600k.","when i upgrade my 9900k, probably on the 14th or 15th gen intels, i'll look at the i5 once more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 13900k would work better if you wanted to do 4+ player gaming on one pc with nucleuscoop.,though i'm pretty sure even it would struggle to run a full 16 player cod death match.,gotta have a xeon/threadripper for that sort of party.,even then those cpus can't typically clock as high as mainstream chips.,until game consoles start shipping with 16 core cpus standard no single game should really cause a 13600k problems.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i5 13600k if purely for gaming, i7 13700k if gaming and other cpu intensive work or streaming.",i9 just not a great value but good for bragging rights,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes i5's can't pull 240+ watts of power out the box,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that intersting answer but look like the 11900k and 10600k will both bottlenecking the 4090 4080 or 7900",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
interesting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
even non-highend gaming is easily possible with a 13400,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just pair an i3 with a good gpu that will keep your system balanced and you will have your gaming rig ready for anything.,"core i3s aren't just for browsing today, 4 cores and 8 threads are surely enough to play most (and recent) games with comfort in 1080p.","&#x200b;

once i've tested every available configuration in the market (and those that were/aren't available) by turning off some cores in my i9.","every configuration having hyper-threading on, runs just fine in games counting from 4c/8t.",the only configurations that were facing many issues during gameplay were the ones with pure cores (ht off).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah if u wanted to increase fps or the experience i think first u should upgrade the gpu to 4090 or 7900 second get a mon monitor which can run 4k 144hz a 100% pci p3, after u should buy a top-end keyboard and mouse finally upgrade you ram and lastly is the cpu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah but when u need more core epyc should be a much better choice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"aye, those top chips tend to hold stupid pricing used.",just check the insane pricing for second hand 7700k on ebay.,"used 9900k is also going for almost as much as a 13600kf, which is just nuts.",i can imagine 5800x3d getting a similar status.,wouldn't be surprised if it sells for $200+ still 3-4 years from now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but if for work u can connect to your companyâ€™s servers a i3 will more than enough.or if u really need one why donâ€™t a epyc or xeon those are facing to the professional,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how much core can a game use.mostly only 4 or 6 but not 12 or 16 and if u using a middle class gpu in running in 2k or high end in 4k\8k the bottleneck should be on the gpu but not cpu.if u pay for a 4090 are u going to play on 1080p?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got one just for the case it came in.,absolutely worth it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you using cubase or protools?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah that what i wanted to point out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i get u but the is a special case i think 13600k can handle 3player  4core per person,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a i5 cannot sully use your 360 cooler or 1000w power supplyðÿ¤£,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it will drop someday... i.e.,"i have 11900k because for~225$ was worth to upgrade 11600k (in fact was really cool cpu), but sold at the same price :)))",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i get u but we are talk about the same gen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for 700,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah if u use a 360 or 280 cooler probably u can have more than 6hz on a i5 but not i9 u pro may need a 480cooler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am wondering have u change your gpu or what gpu are u using?and also we are talking about the same gen cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so in that situation, we should consider a eypc or xeon but no a i9",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i quite argee with u.but using the cpu to increase cpu fps  is mainly for someone using 4090 or 7900,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no not really.,we're talking 10fps difference in gaming.,productivity is the only time it's worth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i pretty much agree with your point.just a low-end cpu can handle most on the game maybe i3 12100.but if looking for the cpu work i think we should consider the epyc or xeon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but i think we need to clear one thing the i series  target consumer is just normal people.if u need lot core u can connect to your companyâ€™s service or get a xeon or epyc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if your cpu can pay for itself and need multi core u should get a xeon it epyc or connect to your company servers.and obviously we are not talking about physical.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you want?,why does our opinion matter?,it would obviously give you more frames.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sorry are u talking about the topic btw although and gpu have be much more powerful.but the n still have advantages like dlss and more support to the professionals.u cannot even run a ai learning on the 6600xt but 3060ti.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
only if you play at 1080p  in which case that's your own stupid fault for buying a 4090 for 1080p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah we should be a clever consumers even u are using a 3080ti a 12400 is a pretty good deal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't think the 10 or 9 gen i9 is a good deal because it is still selling for around 300 is same as a 13600k what u wanted to point is most of us dont need 12 core or 10core,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
definitely the best cpu case lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i use a bunch of different daws - cubase, fl studio, reason, and ableton.",depends on what i'm doing.,:),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11900k is a special case and is worst than the 10850k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
forgot to mention that.,"i kept the same gpu (2080ti)

i understand.","i was just noting that for purely gaming, the fps difference is very small from the 13600k to 13900k.",700 and 900 is just if you want better render times/if you stream a lot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i went from 150fps (i5 7400) in csgo to about 400fps (r5 3600) and a 1050, thats why i was mentioning that its mainly esports titles",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
u mean in 2k and a middle end gpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for ""work at home"" use you dont have to go on such expensives cpu's, and if you really need so much power normally the company where you work will provide you with that kind of machine",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4090 is bottlenecked by 5800x even in 4k: https://www.techpowerup.com/review/rtx-4090-53-games-ryzen-7-5800x-vs-core-i9-12900k/2.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah if u play in 4k or 8k there will be no difference because the bottlenecks are all on the gpu but not cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
word.,i use cubase and have the addictive drums vsts/plugins plus a ton of others that i use.,"i did notice it worked better when i upgraded from a 3570k to a 10900k, and also the ram to 4000mhz 32gb.",i wasn't sure if it was due to vsts and plugins... i thought ram was most important but can see why the cpu would play a part due to the mem controller probably.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it doesn't matter.,there's almost no games that will benefit from more cores.,the clock speed and cache are really the biggest factors and the combination of all of those will give you a little bump.,"if money is of concern whatsoever, nothing over a 13600k should be considered for gaming.",it just doesn't make any sense.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
100%.,if i needed something more that i didn't have at home work provided me the tools.,was just a matter of filling out some forms and getting the equipment tagged.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah agree,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you care about the things that nvidia is good at?,"ray tracing, or certain professional programm?","dlss is a little better than fsr, but do you care about those?","or are you just going for gaming, non ray traced?",these are questions to ask yourself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
either can be a good value depending on your needs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i can verify this statement.,upgraded to a 13700kf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sure, but the 5800x is a generation (or a generation and  a half if you count 5800x3d) behind latest and greatest and op is asking about 13600k or 13900k.",i expect there would be no real differences in gaming with a 4090 with a 13600k vs 13900k and a serious bottleneck would only exist at 1080p  and that isn't the fault of the cpu.,"also, the 5800x is only 6 percent slower on average than the 12900k at 4k in that benchmark, it's really only specific cpu intensive games (or games that traditionally run better on intel chips) so i wouldn't really call that a significant bottleneck, unless you happen to play mostly those games that don't run well on the 5800x.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for sure!,addictive drums is really good (and expensive!),definately a cpu/memory intensive vst for sure.,when you start routing a lot of plugins through your vitual mixer the mid tier processors do seem to take a hit with playback.,its even more noticable during mix down if you have a ton of tracks.,my songs will have 20+ tracks and i was at a snails pace on the i5-9600k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if u using a 3060ti or 6600xt on and those 3a games i mean not csgo or pubg(those 7700k and 1070 can already be 2k 144hz) there should be only around a 2% difference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

good work !,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the i5 -13600kf doesn't have graphics so your question mainly depends on your gpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's seriously good.,however i'd highly suggest going for the 5800x3d which is similar-faster whilst working fine on am4 boards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if u only play roblox gta  or fornite.i3 12100 or 12400 will work pretty well u can use the money u save and spend on the ram and gpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i saw a 30-40% increase in gta v upgrading from a 10700k to a 13600k with a 3070.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s better than the 12900k and 5800x3d for gaming so iâ€™d say itâ€™s quite fast.,"you do have to take advantage of ddr5 support for this to be true, but itâ€™s worth the investment imo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, sorry.",i have a 3070.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh ok. according to the bottleneck calculator though, the 5800x3d bottlenecks my 3070 by like 48%.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe just a 12400 12100 is enough for him why don't he use those money to upgrade his gpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well what is your current cpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, that's bs.","x3d easily drives 6950 / 3090ti, it starts to fall off on a 4090 but all currently available cpus do.",x3d and 13600 are top notch for gaming but the x3d rly is a no brainer if you're alrdy on am4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no it won't lmao.,but i'd still go for the 13600k unless you really want amd.,"it's not going to perform much worse if at all and often times better, has insanely better oc potential, you can get it up to 13900k level, and for general pc and productivity it's much betterm",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol.,5800x3d is almost as fast as 13900k.,"it won't bottleneck a 3070, unless running extremely demanding cpu games in 720p... if you are in am4 go for the 5800x3d and save while you have 95% or more of the performance of 13900k with much lower cost and power... anyway who says any other way is misleading you... that chip is the best thing to come out lately... best cpu for some games still even after new generations...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
stop using bottleneck calculator and learn about hardware.,my ryzen 7 1700x doesnt bottleneck my rtx 3070 at 1440p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bro 5800x3d is better than a 13600kf for sure idk what kind of crack that site is on,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what the fuck sort of software is that?,was it made by userbenchmark or something?,"the 5800x3d is literally the world's fastest cpu, for now.",there is no way that it'll bottleneck a (almost) last gen upper kid range graphics card.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a r5 2600x i bought my pc originally as a pre-built.,i got a insanely good deal on my gpu when the entire market was really inflated.,"i bought it intending to upgrade my cpu, and i'm finally ready to do it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
alright thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"itâ€™s not as fast as the 13900k, the 5800x3d scores about 15k in multicore while the 13900k scores 40k (in cinebench r23), maybe in gaming yes, itâ€™s almost as fast as the 13900k, but raw performance is not",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"gaming cpu*

5800x3d is *okay* at other stuff (it is still 8 cores and recent), but far outclassed by higher core count cpus.","but yeah, in games intel only starts to match it with ddr5 builds and then not always.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 13600k should be a noticable jump but you're on am4 already.,see if your motherboard can support zen3 (with bios update) and if so consider the 5800x3d or 5700. so you don't have to buy a new motherboard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's not even the fastest gaming cpu unless you're only looking at sims.,"hwub, gamers nexus etc all have the 7000 series and 13th gen beating it in several games",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh, yeah.",i did already plan on buying a new motherboard anyway.,the main reason i wanted to upgrade my cpu as well is to get rid of the bottleneck my cpu currently puts on my gpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"but then you'd be saying ""the fastest gaming cpu is... not something that exists"" which isn't that helpful.",it's broadly the fastest and doesn't really perform *poorly* in any titles.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you're insistent on buying a new motherboard the i5-13600kf with a z690 will do you well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13900k is probably the fastest on average.,5800x3d is definitely up there and king for simulation games but it's not 'broadly' the fastest,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"haha, that's funny.",that's the mb i was planning on getting.,thanks for your help and suggestions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"z690 a pro which has bios flashback function and 13600kf + patriot viper 4400cl19, this is my setup and it rocks.",all you have to do is to flash a newest bios available for the board and you are set.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i recommend you to gat a 12400 b660m than upgrade your ram and gpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
stealing lanes from the gpu slot won't present a performance penalty within the foreseeable future.,"even if 8 lanes are reallocated for m.2, a pcie gen 5 slot running in x8 mode is equivalent in speed to a gen 4 slot running in x16 mode.",gn just had a video last week showing very little performance difference between pcie gen 3 & 4 even with an rtx 4090.  so it is going to be at least several more generations of gpus before any get hamstrung by pcie gen 4 x16 / gen 5 x8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for anyone that concerned about gen5 m.2 support, am5 is the much better option.","x670e supports up to three gen5 slots and retains x16 lanes for the gpu slot, on top of having an upgrade path.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the point of pcie5.0 m.2 slots is to be able to drive m.2 ssds with only 2 pcie lanes instead of 4. same bandwidth but less lanes means you can put more on your board.,i don't think there's any consumer ssds that exist right now that can max out the bandwidth of a pcie4.0 4x slot (8gb/s both ways) even in artificial benchmark workloads.,"it's going to take a long time, more than 5 years before ssds actually benefit from higher than 8gb/s link speeds in real workloads where the bottleneck will always be elsewhere.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 4090 would be running at 4x8 though.,"not necessarily a big deal, but worth noting.","might be an issue once directstorage is more widespread, but even then...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"amd is by far the better pcie 5.0 solution with 28 cpu lanes, but its 5.0 lane breakdown actually looks like this:

- x16 lanes for gpu
- x4 lanes for m.2 ssd
- x4 lanes for m.2 or other use
- x4 lanes to connect to chipset (equivalent bandwidth to intelâ€™s current dmi interface)

so technically thereâ€™s 24 usable lanes, which would be a gpu and two m.2 drives.","some x670e boards include an add-in card for a third 5.0 m.2, but that steals x8 gpu lanes like on intel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"those are undeniably strong selling points for am5, but when looking at overall performance/value (and assuming you will keep the system for a few years), raptor lake is more appealing right now imo.","given that the gpu has enough bandwidth left, which largely seems to be the case for pcie 4.0 cards, the single gen5 m.2 compromise still looks fairly reasonable.","also, much remains to be seen regarding the real-world performance benefits of the first generation of gen5 ssds (i will still want one though...).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how does the bandwidth on that even ends up looking like?,"unless you put the gpu on the chipset lanes, all that has to go through the cpu on amd as well right?","so you end up getting limited by whatever the dmi equivalent is, which is presumably much less than 5x16.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i really donâ€™t think that the â€œpointâ€ of it, especially since the first 5.0 prototypes being shown have speeds of up to 13,000 mb/sec.","however it would be a good use of the technology, and hopefully bifurcation options will support it.","right now the biggest problem with the 5.0 lanes on 12th and 13th gen is the cpu can only support x16 or x8/x8 bifurcation (not even x8/x4/x4), so sticking a single x4 ssd onto a 5.0 m.2 slot ends up consuming 8 pcie 5.0 lanes.",now thatâ€™s inefficient!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am not sure i follow.,for example my z690 board has 2 pcie 5.0 x16 slots.,"if both slots are occupied, then they each run in x8 mode.","but that is still 5.0 x8 mode, correct?",i figured stealing lanes from the pcie 5.0 slots to allocate to m.2 would be the same thing in that regard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s fair.,iâ€™m not even saying thereâ€™s no reason to get rpl.,"i think for anyone that keeps their platform for 4+ years, then having an upgrade path or lack thereof is irrelevant, which in that case, canâ€™t really go wrong with 13th gen, as every cpu down the stack is an excellent value all around, especially for anyone that wishes to max out their ddr4 for another couple of years.","however, for those that upgrades more often, am5 is superior in every way, even without taking the upgrade path into consideration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s not that dissimilar to intel.,"the 5.0 x16 gpu is cpu connected, as are two 5.0 x4 m.2 slots.","everything else chipset connected has to travel through 4 pcie 5.0 lanes, which is equivalent bandwidth to intelâ€™s dmi interface.",(being cpu connected is more desirable than chipset connected.),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> but that is still 5.0 x8 mode, correct?",you will be limited to the speed of the pcie card plugged in.,"for all practical purposes, it is equivalent to two 4.0 x8 unless you've got pcie 5 devices to populate them with.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"stick a pcie 3.0 gpu into a pcie 5.0 x16 slot running at x8, and you get a pcie 3.0 x8 connection.","now do that with a currently-doesnâ€™t-exist 5.0 gpu, and yes, you would get 5.0 x8.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 4090 only supports pcie 4.0, so regardless of what the slot's spec is, it will run in 4.0 mode with the same 8 lanes active if split.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,it's be gen 4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"pch interlink on am5 is [only gen4x4](https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/amd-x670.jpeg), otherwise spot on.",intel's dmi 4.0x8 is the wider interface this generation (both z690 and z790).,eta: added block diagram.,"when amd said ""gen 5 everywhere,"" what they actually meant was ""gen 5 only on the cpu lanes, and nowhere else.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh, youâ€™re right!","apparently theyâ€™re 5.0 on the cpu side, but the chipset only supports 4.0, so what you get with this generation of boards is 4.0x4 or 8gb/sec.","so, if we standardize all available cpu interconnect bandwidth into pcie 5.0 lanes, amd has 26 lanes and intel 22.

itâ€™s a bit misleading for amd to keep referring to 28 pcie 5.0 lanes, when 4 of them must be used to connect to the chipset and they can only be used at 4.0 speeds at this time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

100% this is because you did not update the management engine to a 13-gen compatible firmware.,this is entirely different than the bios.,"you need to get into windows (put your 12th gen back in, or swap your ssd from the cpu connected to a chipset connected slot), download the me driver and firmware packages from your motherboard maker, then install the drivers, and finally install the updated me firmware.",they really need to be much clearer that this is required.,after that everything should be fine.,"you probably didnâ€™t even know it existed, but the management engine is essentially a tiny computer embedded inside your pc with its own operating system that actually runs your computer.","when a 13th gen cpu is installed on a 12th gen board with outdated me firmware, all sorts of weirdness happens: inexplicably slow performance, missing bios features, non-functional xmp profiles, non-functional cpu-connected m.2 slot, and so forth.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"with windows 10, the biggest risk is just having the flash fail and making your motherboard useless.",it doesnâ€™t happen often but itâ€™s possible.,"if you were in windows 11, there is also a risk you will wipe the keys used for windows store apps in the tpm.",this is an issue when using a cpu provided tpm.,bios updates can improve performance or add compatibility for memory profiles.,it also has microcode updates that can fix bugs in instructions or patch security issues.,the latter is important but can also slow performance!,meltdown and spectre patches for older chips has a big hit for some workloads.,i would read the release notes and determine if itâ€™s something you actually need.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

- bios versions past the 1600 series may have broken undervolting support

if you're not noticing any issues i'd leave it alone to be honest.,bios updating isn't risk free.,"however if you do choose to update, you can go direct to the latest one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

haven't noticed any issues till date.,only use it to play cs that's it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if the system is already up and running, i agree.",but when i'm building i usually update the bios to the then current version.,"since there isn't an os yet, there is little risk.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"but on asus z690, isn't the only method for updating bios is via the pen drive?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
am i missing anything performance wise by not updating?,the computer is already running flawless on windows 10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can do it from inside the bios.,itâ€™s just literally copying a file to the stick.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
usually not unless they improve memory compatibility...   but that usually only comes into play if your using a fast xmp memory kit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"using ddr4- 3600 , cl16.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not the same system, but i had to update my bios to get the rated speed out out of my ram.","are you sure your ram is actually running at 3600mhz, or is that just what it's rated for?",that could make a difference in csgo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes in task manager it shows 3600 mhz.,(after enabling xmp).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
does this work on windows?,i noticed there is an .msi in the release.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

97âºc after just 1 run or after 10 minutes thermal test ?,"if is 10 mintues this temps are normal when power limits are disabled 

&#x200b;

and contact frame will not drop your temps like you think, this will prevent the cpu not getting bend and after time dont lose contact and only there u will maybe see a some few 5âºc max on increase without the contact frame.","so only after some few months if u cpu got bend by not ussing contact frame , and not all cpus will got bend anyway...the contact frame will do the magic trick and drop those 5c",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
memory controller on the cpu bad/die?,the ram not working in dual channel but single channel might be an indicator.,the cpu light = ?,since lights can be inaccurate but might support the theory?,you try clearing the cmos?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is the cpu seated correctly?,do you have any bent pins?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sounds like the cpu is defective or improperly seated.,could also be the motherboard.,your ram def did not fry anything this is something elseâ€™s fault,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is the cpu seated correctly?,do you have any bent pins?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"bent pins in the cpu socket, too much/uneven mounting pressure from your heatsink, damaged dimm slot(s).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is the answer.,"it's either a defective cpu, or a defective motherboard where either 1 channel is dead or some pins are bent on it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the z690 since you can overclock the 13600k while the b660 board would not let you overclock.,just make sure that board has bios flashback to update bios or else 13th gen cpu won't work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
msi pro z690-a very good value z690 motherboard.,go for it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
overclock was not really a big factor for me if the other boards had better features or was higher quality.,only z690 has flashback  so i got that one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
apparently it is.,it's the only one on sale others are on their regular prices.,i got the z690,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i see it's too late, but i went for a budget b660 with my existing ddr4 sticks and eye a ddr5 upgrade later with a z board.",i think it is the best path.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this was my initial idea too.,i even settled on 12400f and a b660 and then to maybe upgrade to 14th gen with a new board when it comes out.,"but then 12400f started to look like it may force me to upgrade too early, to basically mean money i paid for it would be wasted.",(also extra cores in 13th gen useful to me because of my work.),"so i went with 13600k but was not sure about b660, hence this thread.",if 13400 was out i would have probably got that and kept b660.,"right now, plan is go as long as i can without upgrading.",maybe ocing in later in the life of the build if it comes to that.,drr5 right now is not looking very hot especially with the price of the sticks and the boards.,i would wait a couple of generations of boards for the tech to iron out it's kinks and price to come down.,"after this purchase i probably would not upgrade to ddr5 on lga1700, i got 32gb 3600 cl16 ram, i may add some of the same as an upgrade down the line

i do not have any (easily accessible/borrowable) 12th gen to update b660s firmware, z690 can be updated without a cpu.",this was a big point in the decision too.,"another big issue for me is, we are in a big economic downturn as a country and upgrading later or delaying the build may be too costly.",it looks like i may not be able to build the very same system for 1.5x the price in local currency in about 6 months.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i understand, where i live we're past the big fx drop, so i've actually paid more than $500 for the 13600k in 2021 rates.","ddr5 is maturing fast however and based on hub reviews  better ones do provide a substantial overhead, much more than cpu oc, especially as raptor lake boosts pretty good as stock.","i think in 1-2 years a good kit will be even better yet come down in price, which is a nice option as i want to keep the cpu as long possible... so yeah, i've paid about half as much as a z690 for the b660 matx, including the bios update so it was very cool as it could boot out of the box.","my plan/hope is that as rates normalize it will allow me to do a mobo/ram update at reasonable price while better memory and oc add 30+% performance, especially as eventually i'll move on from the 3080.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
need?,no they don't need one.,can it benefit you?,yes it can by making sure it doesn't bend and provides good even contact.,not everyone goes ham on their components.,another side note i would make is some folks use aio's with back plates that make the contact frame irrelevant as they already have the bracing needed to keep it from twisting.,older intel's motherboards and aib partners at the time came with back plates to stop flexing.,so its up to you but anyone who has used one will not likely tell you its a bad investment.,cheers!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"its not been fixed, and the issue isn't with the cpu, its with the mount on the motherboards, which still remains the same.","a contact frame costs $15, no reason not to get one.",intel are dicks for not fixing / updating the stock mount on z690 / z790 boards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"jesus, how many more times is this stupid question going to be asked?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m running a 13700k with mce along with a nhu12a and my temps are decent.,highest temp iâ€™ve seen was 78 while gaming and that was when the map was loading.,no contact frame though i do have the thermalright one.,might give it a go once i repaste later on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it wasnâ€™t expensive, you donâ€™t even need the thermal grizzly one.","i just got the cheaper option you can find plenty, itâ€™s easy to install watch the gamers nexus video, no issues",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is there a list of which aios are helping already?,i hope arctic has it lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"these chips are meant to be overclocked, but you can't expect the latest gen chip run cool under a weak cooling solution.","if you're into power limits, why not buy a cheap non ""k"" cpu and save yourself a headache.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
imagine responding like this instead of just answering the question...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is that yes or no?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what case are you using?,"i have the nh-u12a black and plan to get a 13700k, did end up checking if the frame improve temperatures?",not sure if i should bother with the contact frame for this cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"gaming power usage is extremely low, the problem is with productive workloads.",run cinebench with that cooler and the 13700k will hit throttling in 30 seconds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is no list that i am aware of at this time sadly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a fractal torrent.,i didnâ€™t bother with the contact frame though i do have one.,"also i used noctua nth1 thermal paste and oddly the temps the next day were even better than they initially were, but i have some cryofuze in the way so i may install the contact frame when that comes in and repaste.",i also run my u12a fans at full speed as they donâ€™t really make much noise.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"really no reason at all to overclock these chips, .2ghz oc won't serve to do anything but pull more power and generate more heat.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">whats a good voltage for

the lowest possible.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my 13700k needs 1.31 load voltage for 5.7.,1.345 for 5.8 and 5.9 is basically unobtainable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"stock voltage on 13900k is around 1.23v, the best result i've seen is 6.0 all core at 1.28v on a 13900kf.","i've not seen anything close to 5.8 all core at under 1.3v for the 13900k from anyone, hence why i'm going to get a 13900ks this time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are doing it backwards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1.8 usually,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i know that.,was meaning how low or high have other peoples all core 13900k voltage gotten to?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
on all cores?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and is that with pl1=pl2 253w or unlimited?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unlimited,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i assume you can't maintain those clocks for long before throttling?,or are you on liquid cooling?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah, well they had 2 of each in store in the glass case.",also a handful of i7 13700ks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok so the kf is actually better because chips with a dead igpu are not binned.,"all the 13900ks have been aggressively binned to save good ones for the 13900ks, very few reaching 5.8 all core without crazy voltage.",then someone on ocnet posted a 13900kf doing 6.0 all core at just 1.28v.,"personally seeing all these results, i'm going to be wasting money on the ks for the first time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it means the cpu doesn't have an integrated gpu.,"or more accurately, the integrated gpu has been disabled.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this seems like a conspiracy theory,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you are asking the wrong question.,the real question is whether you expect to be cpu limited in the short term and need oc.,"if not, keep you ddr4 and buy a cheap b660 matx that will still allow you memory oc.","then when ddr5 matures in 1-2 years, buy a (by then) discounted z790 with both better value and faster ddr5 vs. what you get today, while suffering marginal depreciation on the b660.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
go check frame chasers youtube videos.,he has tested good ddr4 vs ddr5 ram.,most larger youtube channels just test 3200/3600mhz ddr4 and never try to push that platform in their reviews.,example here [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou55iexg3z8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou55iexg3z8) with 4133c15 vs 7000c30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s not day & night but there is small performance difference.,i personally went with ddr5 just to have it & sold ddr4 ram,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
assuming you're using this for gaming.,"at 4k, the difference is very small.","that makes sense because at 4k on newer games you're usually gpu bound, even with a 4090. with older games technically you will shift back to being cpu bound... but when you're playing older games, a ddr4 13600k will still be sufficient to max your your monitor's refresh rate.","as you go down to 1440p and 1080p, the difference does grow for modern titles.",it's not a small difference at 1080p.,"but with older games or esports titles, chances are ddr4 will still be fast enough that your monitor's refresh rate will be the bottleneck.",this video has some benchmarks.,after watching this i adjusted my new 13600k build from z790 ddr5 to z690 ddr4-3600.,saved some money with essentially no loss to performance.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qklb9pm4hdk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what's the actual price delta in your situation?,the same as moving to a 13700k?,13900k?,if you didn't think going up to those is worth it then there is no way ddr5 5600/6000 will be worth outside of maybe very specific scenarios and you'd need to put very heavy weighting on those scenarios.,personally speaking even for a new build i don't feel people should be considering ddr5 unless they are at minimum already getting a 13700k.,"as i would either spend more for the faster cpu, spend elsewhere (eg.",gpu for gaming) or just save the money.,"for those that would be reusing ddr4, especially fast ddr4, and would otherwise just be junking it than that would be a 13900k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yes, that is the correct conclusion.",additionally for gaming you can get similar level of performance easier and cheaper with best in class ddr4 than with best in class ddr5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok you need some educating you do.,intel 12th / 13th gen uses something called 'gears'.,"gear 1 the imc runs at 1:1 with the ram, gear 2 is runs at 1:2, so it is halfed.","gear 2 is mainly for high speed ddr5, but to get the same latency as ddr4 4000 at gear 1, you need 8000 at gear 2.

now comes the limitation of the ddr4 in gear 1, most 12th and 13th gen chips can only manage gear 1 up to around 4000 mhz.","trying to run 4400+ will always need gear 2, so your ram will be a little bit faster, the imc latency will be halved!","the benefit to still using ddr4 is to go as high as you can in gear 1, and this comes down to silicon lottery.","some people have managed 4200-4300 in gear 1, but this is less than 1% of chips, no one has yet managed or posted 4400 gear 1 on 12th or 13th gen.

you will not get 4400 to work on gear 1, and 4400 g2 will be slower than 4000 g1.",you won't find any proper benchmarks or reviews on noob tech sites because no one on those sites knows how to correctly oc and tune their ram.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oops, thatâ€™s 3600 on the ddr4.","while i know youâ€™re looking at frequencies, itâ€™s the tight timings and low latency of that ddr4 i linked that make it outstanding for gaming.","also, those are the only 2 ram kits iâ€™ve used with my 13900k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

7000+ tuned ddr5 beats tuned ddr4.,"anything at xmp is meh, 6000xmp is about on par with 3600cl16.",the only reason to stay on ddr4 is if you already have 4000+ low timings stuff.,"regarding prices, all xmp does is give you factory overclocked ram that you can do yourself on a cheap kit with the same ram chips, mainly referred to as ics (i don't know what ic stands for though).","7600+ stuff is hynix a die, you can get that on 6000 kits at the lowest and overclock it yourself.","you can also get hynix m die which is the second best ddr5 for cheap on 4800 kits which can overclock to around 7000-7200, and usually with better timings than a die.","theres plenty of resources available online to help identify which kts have which ics, paying loads of money for ram just isnt worth it.","i currently run a ballistix max 4400 kit at 4900cl17 gear 2, just because my 12600k imc is shit and only goes up to 3800 on gear 1. other people with the same ram have managed 4133 cl14, but this purely depends on getting a good imc on the cpu.","whether its better or worse i don't know, i'm waiting for a new case to release soon and then use a new z790 ddr4 board and likely going to overspend on a 13900ks next year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'll be shocked if the pins are bent.,i did this on my latest build.,i was annoyed i had to clean the pins (not fun) but it ended up fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
get some crc electronic cleaner it's pretty good for that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can clearly see that pins are bent.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how did thermal paste end up on the socket?,.\_.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"pins should be ok, >90% isopropyl alcohol with a soft bristle toothbrush and carefully stroke in small, unidirectional strokes.",do not pour the alcohol on the socket.,"everything should be ok, my friend.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can try to unbent the pins with a toothpick.,what do you have to lose anyways ðÿ¤£,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"paste is easy to get off, iâ€™ve done it several times using 99% alcohol and inverting the board.",i sprayed the crap out of it with pure alcohol and it all eventually dissolves and it falls off.,the alcohol evaporates.,you just have to be careful- take youâ€™re time and try not  to damage any pins or drop the board.,â€¦bent pins is a whole other deal.,"although usually fixable - it requires a very steady hand, and lots of patience.",very tricky but doable- i used a plastic mechanical pencil with no lead in it last time and it was successful on a z390 board with a dozen bent pins.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if the paste isn't the conductive type just ignore it for now.,it's the bent pins that is a serious issue.,my colleague is a dab hand at fixing bent pins.,"using your phones camera to zoom in for finer detail, using the finest tool to gently and patiently correct the pins.",a fine sewing needle or dental tools are the preferred tools if you don't want to damage it further.,take your time.,good luck.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you can try to carefully clean and bend back any bent pins.,"btw, even if a pin breaks, it may still work without it.",a lot of pins are for power delivery and it's not a problem to lose even several of those.,"losing some other pins may make some of your memory slots to not work or, in the worst case, your system may not start at all.",i'd suggest you watch a few videos where people clean/unbend lga pins and just hope for the best.,i doubt that you can break anything (more than is already broken),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if you have a small phillips + you can use the v in the + to hold onto a pin as you press down on it to bend it back into place.,this lowers the chances of the pin slipping and the tool impacting other pins (ask how i know lol).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

also make sure the bios supports your cpu you may need to update it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you need an allen wrench to install cpus right?,and a multi tool for installing the motherboard?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
one user claims it is non conductive (electrically).,"if you can clean it off, great (you will then be able to see if you have pinndamage), but it won't short between pins.",https://www.bestbuy.com/site/questions/thermaltake-tg-7-0-1-oz-thermal-grease-gray/4407100,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah not that many pins bent try to bend them back with a very small flathead screwdriver a large magnifying glass and a lot of light helps take your time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just drop the cpu in

just use a screwdriver",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
didn't they just advise a swiss army knife and you are good to go?,xd,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i worked with damaged intel boards like this.,and even less damaged as this.,but was still having problems booting.,fixing pins on an intel board is pretty much next to impossible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
haven't people recommended taking bent pin motherboards to watch repair shops?,steady hands + small tool experts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dont forget the cock n balls strap i mean 'anti static bracelet'.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"eh, this level of damage is worth a shot.","don't even need to fix the ground pins technically, and it's just a few that you can fix with a steady hand.","none of the pins look irreparable, just slightly crooked.",i fixed an 1191 socket that looked similar to this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
certainly a pain in the ass but i wouldn't say impossible like the ones that have a whole section smashed forget it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've done it.,"use a stiff needle stuck into a cork, and a magnifier.",i used my camera live view and macro lens as it's all i had that gave a clear view.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thats a great idea not sure how many watch shops are still around but they would definitely have the right tools.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, i fat fingered a 13600k, it slipped and hit the left side of the socket while installing a tt frame.",bent around 5 pins.,"managed to straighten them enough with a needle, and to make sure they are not touching each other.",got lucky and the system booted with dual channel and pcie lines intact.,either the fix worked or the pins are not used.,system has been running without a problem for 3 days.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably thermal throtteling.,"if you are limited by thermals, reducing power consumption will mean higher clocks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you should do more tests,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"undervolt means less power is going in

less power means less heat is generated

less heat generated means it can hit the higher boost clocks longer before the chip thermal throttles, if it does at all

so assuming it doesn't crash because it doesn't have enough power, il boost for longer and run cooler hence the higher score.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in addition to what the others have said, if you have a power limit (wattage) in place, then lower voltage means that wattage goes further.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
one time an error came and cinebench stopped.,now i try with - 0.07,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"cinebench is easy to pass with even a bad undervolt

if cinebench 30minutes is failing, occt will absolutely fail.","get your undervolt stable for both si gle and multicore in cinebench so that 30min tests pass

and another hour for small sse extreme variable",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

install windows 11 or the cpu scheduler won't work correctly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why is everyone buying contact frames are intels not great ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"noted,will definitely use windows 11. thanks!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
isnâ€™t that already fixed and baked into win10?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not true.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for my sake, i'm just doing it because of things i've read, and it's pretty inexpensive.","since i already have the parts loose and will be building it myself, i figured why not.","and also going for watercooled, so it's just fun for me to have it as cool as possible.","from my understanding of what i've read, it's really not required, but in some cases the temp.",drop is significant.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because intels stock ilm can causes bending/warping and uneven cpu cooler mounting which will result in very high temps when not doing anything.,it really sucks but the frames have worked wonders for me.,before was hitting 100 but now hitting 90c after 10 minutes 253w cinebench.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no intel's isn't great.,it's fine but the frame should lower temps by 8 to 10 c and since it's about 10$ it's an easy buy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not afaik.,also intel recommend w11 due to this reason,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the thread director is a windows 11 feature, nothing to be fixed in windows 10, there is no thread director in windows 10 just the regular scheduler.",honestly its overblown.,by comparison amd zen2/3/4 cpus got zero ccd support from neither windows 10 nor 11 and its nothing even planed yet and it causes the same latency impact with ccd core jumps just as intels 12th / 13th gen cpus with p/e cores jumps get aswell.,"thats the difference between ""supported"" by windows and team wintel baking a solution into the os for a specific issue, like big.little support.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, itâ€™s not in windows 10. thatâ€™s not to say that windows 10 is bad or gets bad performance - thatâ€™s not true.",it works fine.,"itâ€™s just that windows 11â€™s upgrade works smarter with e cores, and should result in a â€œsmootherâ€ experience.",this is probably more important for a cpu like the 13900k where thereâ€™s 16 e-cores to worry about.,"previously with the 12900k having 8 and the other 12th gens having 4 at the most, scheduling errors were less likely to impact performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s disappointing iâ€™ve just ordered all my parts too z790 hero and 13900k with the ryujin ii to cool it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mounted finalcool bracket but it didn't change anything regarding temperatures.,"tried washer mod too, no changes.","but to be honest i did out of curiosity, wouldn't change anything performance wise anyway",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think you'll most likely be totally fine!,i just like seeing the numbers as low as possible :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you will now slowly become part man part paste until one day you are entirely paste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that looks like you did more than ""accidentally touch"" it lol.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your hands should cool much better now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wipe it clean with alcohol and apply new paste for good meassure.,"or if you wanna half ass it, just spread the mess you made a bit and evenly with a plastic spatula of sorts so there is good contact with the cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the dirt and oils from your skin can degrade the performance of tim.,but i doubt in any noticable way since this is a stock cooler with stock paste.,"just put it on, it'll be fine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

replace your paste as the stock paste is the worst.,i changed my stock paste with an arctic mx4 and my temps got down by 7â°c.,"i'm also using the stock cooler with 12400f and now the max temp is between 71-75, earlier it used to hit 82-84 at max",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't think you have done anything illegal but i'd consult my attorney.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
won't make a difference.,"for peace of mind, you could smear it even by rotating it back and forth a bit against the ihs during installation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no grasshopper.,just replace it with new.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you should replace it even if you didnâ€™t touch it.,reusing a detatched thermal paste might cause air bubbles to form.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
spread it evenly with a plastic bag where you put your finger in and youre good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nah, it is good to go like this, the pressure will even it out for you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
won't make much of a difference,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"how do you ""accidentally"" fuck it up that much?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just apply new thermal and wipe off old with a cotton swab or cotton wipe.,its really no biggie,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looks fine to me but you can always wipe it and apply new paste anyway,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you have some spare you should replace it but it won't really change anything.,it's most likely going to give you more trouble cleaning it off your finger than it is going to cause you issues with temps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i second the advice of replacing the paste altogether, but i'd go even as far as to recommend replacing the cooler.","black friday is coming soon, so if it's not too much of a stretch for you, get a better cooler, some thermal paste (i personally used thermal grizzly, but i didn't compare it to anything, so i couldn't tell if it's better or worse than anything else.",all i can say is that i find it good).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes it is.,the thermal paste they use is inferior.,clean it off and put some better thermal compound on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

honestly it's probably totally fine.,he could out it together and run it till his paste comes from amazon and repaste it later.,hell he could probably run it with that paste forever it is definitely enough paste to spread with some heat and pressure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no people always have been to picky with thermal paste.,if you had your pc running already for some time.,"like some weeks then you should reapply the thermal paste, because it gets harder over time and cannot make a good connection again.",if you just had the cooler on there for a few minutes then it's still fine.,"also in this case here, the thermal paste will just get pushed to where it needs to be no need to apply new paste.",unless you just don't want the cheap oem thermal paste of course.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they said they tried to spread it back with their finger.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's some wet ass goopy looking paste even if he did just pop it off a cpu he could probably get away with just slapping it back on like it is... you'de be surprised how fine it would be.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's what my assumption was.,just make sure the fresh paste is evenly coated so it doesn't leave any spots open.,i used some arctic mx5 freshly applied.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
*oh*,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes exactly the rest will be done automatically by the pressure between cpu and the cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
evenly coated?,as in spread it?,"since there's no other way to evenly coat an ihs with thermal paste, and that's a horrible idea, you don't benefit from having your thermal paste evenly spread from side to side and the sides and corners don't get as hot as the center, and thermal paste doesnt just magically take heat out from where it's touching.","spreading evenly across your ihs doesn't help and if anything can and will cause bubbles which would end up causing your ihs to become hotter anyways, a pea sized dot has always been the best way to apply thermal paste, same shit applies for laying down tiles but that one is a lot easier to see the difference in if you want to google that even though it is slightly different what the 2 are trying to accomplish they both get there with roughly the same problems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i thought they've done a lot of tests and found no difference and that the universal suggestion is to make sure it is well covered,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, found little to no difference as in touching it and throwing it everywhere does nothing but cause the possibility of causing issues.","spreading it is different from being ""well covered"" where well covered means a solid chunk of the middle not corner to corner or even end to end, unless you're literally putting like 2 milligrams on it and getting half a millimeter coverage than you're most likely not going to need to use more to cover more as it's perfectly transferring heat already.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

they charged me $659 then the price went to $730 for awhile.,i contacted amazon and they were worthless and tried to ask i wait 48 hrs for their team to contact me.,i just filed a return on the cpu since i hadnt opened it and just bought it at the cheaper price!,thx for saving me $30!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"both are ""extreme"" or pushed ram configurations, that will require good memory kits, a good motherboard (i would run them on dual dim mobos such as apex or unify x) and above all depend on the imc of your chip.","ddr4 4200 c15 is a beast, but you need a very good imc to run that on gear 1. if you can't do it and have to run ddr4 on gear 2, then ddr5 is the way.",ddr5 at 7400 c32 is also no joke.,sometimes kits at those frequencies experience some instability even at xmp.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ddr5 ofc, havent u seen benchmarks??",?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if ddr4 4200 c15 was gear one it would win but 4000 usually limit on imc at gear 1. as soon as you switch to gear 2 ddr5 king and bandwidth double for future!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is all about gear one even cas 15 at ddr4 3600 fine ddr5 can only run gear2 so you need say 6200 super tight to get some latency back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ddr5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what imc will take 7400mhz?,"i run 6600, just about boots with 7000.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ddr5 is faster overall but there are scenarios where the ddr4 option you mentioned are faster.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends how much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it depends.,in warzone and mw2 ddr4 wins and any game that perfers low latency to pure bandwidth.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ddr5 at 6600 mhz above always wins against heavily tuned dr b-die at any frequency.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
both the i5-13600k and i9-13900k i have are quite happy running ddr4 at 4200mhz gear 1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i saw some people push imc to 4200 at gear 1 and run well.,"a few people even set very high voltage  to push 4300 or 4400 g1, usually it's single rank stick , but it dont work well.",i want to see some comparison between highest ddr4 and ddr5 freq  which can run well .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ddr4 get lower latency but lower bandwidth .,both latency and  bandwidth effect the game performance .,the result depends on the accurate number.,that is why i want to see some test between them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>if ddr4 4200 c15 was gear one it would win but 4000 usually limit on imc at gear 1. as soon as you switch to gear 2 ddr5 king and bandwidth double for future!,13900k is far better.,i'm running 7800 cl36 on my dark and 7200 cl34 on my hero z690s.,hell even my dark can boot 8200 but not stable yet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"hardware unboxed did extensive testing, even low end 4800mhz ddr5 is better then high end ddr4, both in average fps and 1% fps lows, in 90% of games they tested",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is so false smh.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nope gear 2 yes kills it but that's what got ddr5 crowd to work on 6600 low latency as you only have gear 2.  but yah 6600 low latency key with ddr5 plus all that bandwidth for future!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
latency the key bdie try trfc 280 to 480 and the one that's around 14000 bump to 40000 or 65535 max go down ram speed to get it!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well 3600 cas15 gear 1 beats 4400 cas 18 gear 2 on ddr4 for example i'm in the top 50 3dmark timespy look at cpu marks port royal won't show it near as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
been there done it latency more important bandwidth not really needed right now aida64 you can be talking about 48ns to 85ns closer you are to 50 range important bandwidth in 55000 to 60000 fine you don't need 100000 in games now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sweet, to be honest my corsair 6600mhz is already at 1.4v.",that is pretty much as high you can go.,maybe after xmas i'll dabble in some super fast ram.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i heard about stuttering on asrock boards and they power limit cpu's.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

can you give me the link ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"gear 2 stops ""killing it"" the moment you reach 5000 mhz on ram and bandwidth benefits + dual direction io in ddr5 (2x32 bit bus) makes it stupid to compare ddr4 gear 2 to ddr5 gear 2 as these don't even work the same way.",6600 mhz can operate just on xmp to beat heavily tuned b-die in any game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drop your latency by 4 ns,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as far as i know 4200 cas15 gear1 is not very very hard to push.,"it just needs good motherboard, samsung b-die memory , and one good imc cpu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

went from 9900k to 13900k with 3080 at 1440p.,no regrets.,something people always forget to mention when they say no on posts like this is older games.,i gained like 40fps at least in fallout 4 in cpu bound scenarios.,"even when you donâ€™t use more than one core these newer cpus have much better single core performance that still definitely makes it worth it, especially for older titles that donâ€™t use the 3080 as much and only use a single thread",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i am in the same case than you 9900ks + 3080 but i decide to wait for the zen 4 3d before upgrading,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i play a lot of cities skylines and flight simulator.,both very cpu bound.,the upgrade from 9900k to 13900k was monumental in these games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nope.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no don't do it.,of course if you want to upgrade to the new stuff and eventually get a new gpu that's fine.,i think you will get better 1% lows and a few extra fps but that's about it.,9900k + 3080 is a great pairing.,enjoy it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you stay on a 9900k platform you won't have access to pcie 4.0 storage and your rtx 3080 will operate at pcie 3.0 bandwidth despite the fact it is a pcie 4.0 card.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you can afford it and it wont hurt the budget... sure, go for it...

i would wait for next gen cpus and rtx 5000 series to see what they offer.,9900k with 3080 is still quite solid.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
zen 4 is a better platform as you can keep the motherboard and upgrade the cpu for the next generations also look at the v cache cpu's they will make like the 7700x3d if they call it that and how good that technology is compared to cpu's without it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you so much for sharing your experience.,could i ask why you chose the 13700k vs 13600k?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no difference on that front,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would just buy whats the best buy now and not worry about what you can upgrade into.,people usually keep their cpus for like 4 years or so and by then people would be on am6.,though waiting for the 7800x3d might not be bad since the performance on that should be pretty nice.,buy probably not as cost efficient as the 13th gen offerings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 13900k makes less sense for gaming only workloads and not worth the premium for gaming focused builds unless the user so wish.,performance is basically identical in gaming between the two chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 13th gen are great value let's hope intel release their version of v cache processor's,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i assume the pcb is thicker on that board for whatever reason.,is it more than 8 layers?,asus doesnâ€™t seem to specify how many layers it is.,"iâ€™m pretty sure the z690 hero is 8 layers, but evga has a 12 layer z790 board so higher is possibleâ€¦ especially at the price of the extreme.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
huh?,the ilm is the exact same on every motherboard.,are you really sure you have it the right way?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
others have run into this problem with the tg frame on z790.,you can get longer screws or get a different plate.,i bought the thermalright one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
weird.,debrauer recently showed in his [ek cryo cooler video](https://youtu.be/_wcegymcb7w) that the contact frame fits into the board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
daggyz i had 0 issues installing the thermalright contact frame on my z790 maximus extreme.,you might consider switching it out with the thermal grizzly one.,steve at gamers nexus says there no performance difference between the two so you have nothing to lose.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
having the exact same problem right now on a rog strix z790-f. coming from a direct die 9900k so it's not my first time.,the screws definitely aren't long enough.,"i can get one side in, but then the other side is already lifting up.",following the gn video where the guy screws backwards at the beginning... that's not even possible.,the screws aren't even reaching the hole to hear a click when screwing backwards.,"when i'm reading, that strix z790-e is working well, i'm not sure anymore if it's the mainboard.",i guess it's probably a wrong batch of the frame.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"update: fixed

basically the issue is that the screws that come with the motherboard don't entirely thread all the way to the end of the screw.",the tolerance with the contact frame is very precise it seems and it definitely needs that tiny bit of thread length on the screws to be there to be able to mount.,"solution: 

buy same 6/32 screws but make sure they are threaded to the end.","i purchased some everbilt branded ones but with a hex key socket head that still fits within the frame, and the thread reaches until the very end, allowing it to grab on to the backplate and mount correctly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just an fyi the tg frame isn't supposed to screw down flush to the mainboard it has space between the frame and the mainboard where the screws go in it.,the other frames come into contact with the mainboard like the original ilm.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"mine was like this, just had to use a little bit of pressure to start it.","you are not supposed to screw it all the way down anyways, you're barely supposed to have the threads start to prevent hurting the memory channels.",mine works fine and i've seen upto 10c drops with my 13700k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hole location is not.,ct is not needed anyway,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes i know.,orientation is correct.,transferring it from a z690 hero to a z790 extreme and it legit does not fit.,i can get one corner to screw in but that is because of some tolerance to work with.,"the others are not able to screw in because the tolerance is not there anymore, and push down with some backing behind the back plate and pushing on the frame firmly still does not allow any other screws to thread.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am genuinely baffled why people buy the more expensive yet worse product out of the two.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i wonder what the issue is, because when comparing the screws to those on z690 hero they look pretty much the same.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh wow.,"i'm honestly intrigued now because mine just does not want to fit, but clearly his works so i wonder what the difference is.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"same issue as mine, and same steps taken following the gn video.",you make a good point about a bad or different batch of the screws provided with the motherboard possibly.,"i've just purchased some same length 6/32 screws at the local hardware store, unfortunately they didn't have enough of the next size up in length in stock, but what i noticed was these threads looked to have more threading at the very end when compared to the ones that came with the motherboard.",i will update later with my results.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm having z790-e, can report that same issue exist, stock ilm screws are not long enough :(",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you happen to have a link to the screws you purchased?,i'm also having this issue with the frame on my asus z790 maximus hero,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
right.,the issue is the screws seem to not be long enough to mount it like so.,or the pcb/backplate is different in thickness on this board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
right.,"the issue is the screws don't reach to even be able to start to thread, even with massive pressure.",one side is doable but like you said it's not suppose to be all the way down.,"getting longer screws would fix the issue, but the question remains, is the pcb thicker or is there some variance in the two thermal grizzly contact frames i purchased that don't allow them to install?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thats really weird.,it should be the same.,because you should be reusing the same screws..... sorry i dont know much more,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got the same problem with rog strix z790-f. i'll try the thermalright soon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m not sure but some reviews by end users i read on the tg frame had the same problem on z790.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you tried installing the backplate for your cooler first before you install your contact frame?,gn talked about having the backplate from you cooler installed first so itâ€™s easier for you to screw the contact frame in place.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"https://www.homedepot.com/p/6-32-x-1-4-in-hex-socket-head-stainless-steel-socket-cap-screw-2-pack-805098/204274323

actual screw is way shorter than the picture.","make sure you have a set of both metric and sae allen keys as what one of the reviews said, the socket seems to be a weird in-between size but as long as you have a set of both allen keys you should find one that fits.",you will need to buy two two packs.,you can honestly find any screw that is 6/32 ã— 1/4 as long as the head fits and the threads reach the end.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not sure if it helps but for comparative purposes i am using the asus rog strix z790-e mobo.,i can't imagine there being a massive difference in pcb thickness but i suppose it's possible.,i think the easy solution here is to buy a thermalright for $15 off amazon and see if the issue persists......if it does then i think this might answer some questions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did the thermalright frame went fine with the z790-f board?,i ordered the same board and i plan to get the thermalright contact frame,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, makes no difference unfortunately.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it was just delivered.,i'll try it later today.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i installed thermalright with original screws without any problems.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
from your previous comment you said you were able to get one in because of tolerance.,it seems like the backplate for the ilm and the contact frame is not installed properly or has been damaged causing it to not be able to fit all four screws properly.,have you tried checking the backplate to see if there is any damage?,i doubt thatâ€™s the reason but itâ€™s what i can think off.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the update.,"good to know, guess i'll be doing the same when it arrives",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no damage to either plate.,i actually just went and picked up another contact frame from the central computers and low and behold same thing...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe tried the thermalright one from amazon.,it can be easily returned anyway.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you follow exactly what gn did for the installation of the frame then i am honestly out of idea.,so itâ€™s either yourâ€™s defective or tg made some change to the frame.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah all i can think of is that tg made changes, maybe even a bad batch?",i would say pcb but clearly in the video they have it on the same board just fine...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you may have a bent pin on your socket or a bad capacitor on the back of your cpu.,these two are common issues.,they can let you turn on the computer and run it.,but cpu performance is bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hate to ask but did you check there's no plastic film on the bottom of the coldplate where it goes over the cpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah and i made sure when i took the pump off the second time as well!,also i just disabled hyper threading and it seems to be doing much better(?),lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"something's not right though mate, even an i9 shouldn't be instantly shooting up to 110 on a big cooler like that.",it might be worth playing with the intel xtreme tuning utility - it's got good monitoring and will show you your current power draw etc.,for reference my 2/3 of your size aio keeps 225w of an i5 under 100 degrees.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was using hwmonitor to see what was going on during the cinebench runs and was seeing my wattage go anywhere from 350-375w.,i disabled hyper threading and it came down to 330w average and running about 90c.,(still pretty damn hot)  i canâ€™t seem to find the â€œmceâ€ feature on my asrock board to disable though so thereâ€™s something in my bios iâ€™m missing i believe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intels max wattage spec is 253w for the 13900k.,so your motherboard is absolutely removing power limits.,i dont know what its called on your board.,you can search on google your motherboard and see for yourself.,but.,for sure you need to check your mount/aio.,as your cpu throttles at 100c but its going above that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

alright guys i found the solution and you were 100% right cradenz.,the motherboard was just letting the cpu melt itself lol.,the solution on my asrock motherboard was under the title: â€œload intel base power limit settings.â€ set it to enabled and it ran at the max of 253w and hit a max of 84c then averaged a few degrees lower.,thank you both very much for your inputs as i was getting pretty heated at this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"nice, will try it later",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think there's certainly more to be had, before even going near overclocking.",the thermal solution with mce on is able to achieve a bit more performance in its current state.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

turn on xmp so your memory goes to its proper speed instead of running at the base 2133 speed like it is right now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how'd your build come out?,i was thinking of doing something similar to yours,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oof, that sucks.",your motherboard crystal is not of good quality so in order for spread spectrum to work it actually downclocks the bus clock lower than 100. while its normal.,"usually the bclk will be around 99.95-100.5. 

while in reality this is like... .5% less performance, you can disable spread spectrum to make it go to 100. but you will 100% not notice any difference in any game or task.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m not sure just wanted to check if everything is normal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s pretty fine getting a huge performance difference had the i7-9700k.,everything runs faster temps are pretty fine and no bottlenecks with my 3080,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
meanwhile on my b450 mobo + ryzen 2600 bclk under load drops as low as 90mhz.,but i read on some discussions that this is considered normal for amd system so.. guess it doesn't matter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

as others said the tdp isn't the real world max amount.,other factors come in to play.,also cpus vary.,just watched a vid by der8auer where two 12900ks differed by 10% on wattage.,that's a lot on a 250w+ cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the first question is, **why do you need to upgrade?",** your current cpu is no slouch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to quote the allmighty tech-jesus: do you need to upgrade?,your cpu is perfectly fine.,"wait at least for 14th gen or zen 5, ddr5 will be cheaper as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my opinion is that i think upgrading should only be considered if it gives you at least a 2x improvement in what you use your computer for.,for gaming upgrading the cpu should only be considered if your games start being cpu limited.,if you start seeing games where you can't reach your monitor framerate because of your cpu it's time to consider an upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"personally, iâ€™d say wait.","13th gen would be a decent upgrade if you wanted to keep your ddr4 ram, but if youâ€™re adamant on the ddr5 upgrade, iâ€™d definitely wait at least another year or two.","ddr5 is still in its early stages, and there will undoubtedly be much faster kits at lower prices in the coming year.","by that point, there should be plenty of pcie 5.0 ssds on the market, and i assume the next intel platform will have support for that.","if youâ€™re mainly gaming, a 9900k + 3090 is still a beast of a machine.",donâ€™t fall into fomo if you can avoid it.,what resolution do you game at?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

cpu generational uplifts nowadays are much bigger than in the past.,there was a post made here a few days ago were someone was totally shocked that the i9 13900k gave him 50-60 more fps on average than the i9 9000k.,waiting for another generation is never really good.,because there will always be a new product in a 1 year cycle that performs much better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'd wait.,meteor lake (14th gen) is only a little over a year away.,9900k is still a plenty capable processor.,and the current lga 1700 is a dead end platform.,meteor lake (14th gen) should bring a decent bump in performance as well and most likely have future support for at least another generation after that.,"but every generation ""should"" bring a big bump in performance.",there's always going to be something better in a year or 2. just keep in mind meteor lake will be ddr5 only so you will have to buy new memory as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

makes sense.,"so, that would mean if my cpu usage reaches 100% while the gpu is not fully used?","i guess i am still good in that regard, but i didn't really pay attention to the cpu usage before",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are making some good points.,especially about the fomo aspect.,that's definitely a weak-point for me.,"i was gaming at 1440p @ 144hz for a long time but recently switched to gaming on my tv, so i play at 4k @ 120hz now.",most games i am currently playing are running fine.,"g-sync is definitely helping and i gaming on the tv somehow feels ""smoother"" in general, even if that may be placebo.","i am not too interested in pcie 5.0 ssds, though as i have recently bought some ssds that i would like to keep.",i am definitely more interested in ddr5 and you have a point that it will be more mature when 14th gen comes out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, i now mainly play at 4k on my tv",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50-60 fps more?,that's crazy.,did they only upgrade the cpu or anything else?,i know that with tech you can potentially wait forever.,"but as i am not upgrading cpu/mainboard/ram as frequently as my gpu, i want to make sure the next upgrade i buy for these components is relatively ""future-proof"".","from what i heard, the 14th gen will have a new lithography, so i may want to at least wait for that if it is a bigger step",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ou of the games you mentioned, star citizen would definitely be the most interesting to me.","however, that's just one game out of many, so i don't think it would be worth upgrading just for that",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nova lake would be 14th gen, i guess?",i wrote in a different post that i wanted to upgrade my gpu but will probably skip this generation because of the issues with the power supply and connectors.,i hope the next gen will be a bit more efficient and the starting problems of the new connector will be fixed by then,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am sure i wouldn't regret my decision to upgrade right now.,it's just that i don't necessarily need to upgrade right now and could easily wait another year for the next gen of cpus and gpus.,one of the more compelling arguments to wait is better performance/prices and so on for ddr5 ram,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
buying new memory isn't a problem as i would do that anyways.,"the hope is that by next gen, ddr5 will also be more mature and mainstream",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"13th gen is end of line, best of the best, of socket lga1700.","next design is going to be brand new, and with brand new, comes potentially new problems.",the next gen (14 gen) is already confirmed to be lower core counts.,but overall performance should obviously be higher (otherwise who else will buy it??),its the 15th gen that should increase more core counts than the 14th.,"i say do it now, enjoy.","there will always be something better around the corner, if you wait wait wait wait wait, youll never have anything good.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you got a 3090. i wouldn't even think of upgrading until at least 5000 series.,it's ridiculous how many people buy that overpriced piece of shit that nvidia came up with.,i laugh at every single melting adapter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's more if you start seeing framerate dips below your monitor framerate at the same time as dips in gpu usage.,"if you play a game, it lags in some places, you check the gpu usage and it's not pinned at 99% when the lag spikes happen that's the sign of a cpu bottleneck.",though sometimes it can also be bad game programming so you need to check if others with better cpus have the same issue first.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at 4k you would be better served by a gpu upgrade than a cpu upgrade.,"with the exception of the 4090 in select games, youâ€™re almost always gonna be gpu bottlenecked at 4k.",definitely hold off on a cpu/platform upgrade.,"once there are some price cuts on the new generation of amd and nvidia gpus sometime next year, then a gpu upgrade would totally be worth it for 4k high refresh gaming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"he upgraded the gpu, was not happy with the performance uplift, totally surprised that the 9900k was already a big bottleneck.","yes, meteor lake will be on intels new node intel 4 and tile based.",a very exciting new architecture like alder lake was.,"after meteor lake comes arrow lake, that like raptor lake will improve the prior architecture and excel in it.","after that intel will use a new node, powervia and a new transistor ribbonfet.",basically all upcoming architectures are very exciting.,"so, there is no future proof, new architectures nowadays will outclass the prior generation much faster and by a much bigger margin than ever before.",look how much intel improved the generation from the 9900k to the 13900k.,besides the hybrid architecture itâ€™s just 1 node uplift.,imagine what all the other new architectures will able to doâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nova lake is the 18th gen if i remember well, scheduled for 2025 release 

""nova lake (panther cove [tentative]/ darkmont) 2025â - this will mark the biggest architectural change in cpu architecture since the core architecture is introduced in 2006. intel is working to build entirely new architecture from the ground up much like ryzen with up to 50% cpu performance improvement from the lunar lake.","this is also the reason why glenn hinton returned""

https://wccftech.com/intel-next-gen-arrow-lake-lunar-lake-nova-lake-cpus-rumored-to-succeed-meteor-lake/

that will be a huge jump from the 9900k.","for gaming + the resolution you are using (higher than 1080p), 9900k is good enough until then.","if you really want the latest and greatest though, wait for the 14 gen meteor lake or arrow lake because they will use the intel 4 manufacturing process which will is the next gen after raptor lake's intel 7 process.",meteor lake will come next year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no 14th gen is meteor lake but thereâ€™s some odd rumors floating around with intel reducing the p cores by two on the flagship sku with their new forveros chiplet tech.,still but a rumor per se,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
definitely will be,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this.,"intel's outlook for the next generation seems to be focusing on efficiency cores, as power draw has become excessively high.","this means we might not see the same improvements gen on gen that you might see otherwise, but instead, the 14th gen will focus more on pulling less power while also maintaining speeds that the 13th gen in capable of.","if you decide to wait for the 15th gen to see performance increases again, you might put yourself in the same position you're in now, where you're on the cusp of a new chipset.",might as well go for the 13th gen now.,"you could wait for the 14th gen, but it's wise to wait and ensure they've got all the problems of a new chipset ironed out, too (not saying it'll happen, but it can).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's always my problem.,i already know the answer in the back of my mind but want it validated haha.,guess i will wait another year at least,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the melting adapters are my main concern with the current gen. i hope that will be fixed by the time the 5000 series is released,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have to keep my eyes open for that.,some games have these problems but i think that is due to the game itself and not necessarily my hardware,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was considering a gpu upgrade but will probably skip the current gen due to the issues with the power connector.,"i hope that will be fixed come next gen at which point maybe 14th gen cpus will be released, also.",then a complete upgrade would maybe make more sense,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
interesting.,you would think at some point they will reach a performance ceiling.,it's crazy how this technology keeps improving,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2025 release mean that i could take the middle step of 14th or 15th gen and upgrade again later.,do new gens always release around the same time (october)?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
could get meteor lake.,yeah pretty much.,don't forget that you will need a new motherboard as well when you get it.,propably the z890 chipset which will be released together with meteor lake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what motherboard?,updated me?,are you using xtu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
turn off ia cep(current excursion protection) feature in bios,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"z690 gaming f, unable to use xtu since the voltage settings are greyed out",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
could this be the reason to the power limit?,i have seen this setting in my bios and it was on auto perhaps switching it off will resolve the issue,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if youâ€™re running a recent bios be sure to check for â€œundervoltage protectionâ€.,"and, you definitely need to make sure you have upgraded the intel management engine firmware for proper performance of 13th gen on 600 series boards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am running the latest bios version on this mobo.,by undervoltage protection you mean ia cep in (asus) bios?,as a user mentioned below?,how can i check if i have the latest me installed?,also on the official intel website where you install the driver it says it support up to 12th cpus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
get the drivers from the asus support page for your model.,thatâ€™s also where youâ€™ll download the management engine firmware updates.,"just to be blunt, if youâ€™re running a z690 board with 13th gen and have not specifically or donâ€™t know if youâ€™ve updated the management engine, then thatâ€™s almost certainly your problem.",it *has* to be updated and itâ€™s not part of the bios update.,"thereâ€™s two downloads you need for the management engine, the windows drivers (like a 300mb file) and the actual firmware update tool, which is under 10mb and runs in windows, then will force your system to reboot.",the me is like a little secret onboard computer that runs your actual computer.,"when a 13th gen cpu is installed into a 12th gen motherboard with old me firmware, all sorts of weirdness happens, such as mysteriously lacklustre performance, missing bios features, non-functional system features (classic is the cpu-attached m.2 slot doesnâ€™t work), broken xmp support, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

have you checked power settings/cooler selection?,most likely culprit.,"cinebench can swing a few hundred points multi core score for no good reason, so if you're in the ballpark and single core is good, you're fine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you install the latest drivers from the website?,read bios notes and see if you can go back to the older bios if you want?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what did you get before?,perhaps the microcode update contained mitigations for new spectre-like exploits which have performance costs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10300-10350 points on multi-core.,1400-1419 single-core.,i agree.,maybe thatâ€™s the cause.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

jwt945gcl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe the â€œmissingâ€ memory is onboard video ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't update the bios for this.,"as others have said, most likely the memory is being stolen for graphics and other things.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
945gc is an old intel chipset.,the first three letters looks like 'jwt ',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the model number will be silkscreened somewhere on the front of the motherboard.,just take a good resolution photo of the front and post that.,"i see jwt945gc-l or jwt345gc-l on that sticker, and that doesnâ€™t seem to be a valid model number, probably more of a production code.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
system memory is probably shared with integrated graphic card memory,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
jnt945gcl i guess but ofcourse i maybe wrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
does the motherboard post?,you're able to get into windows?,"if you answered ""yes"" to both of the above, then download an application called ""[cpu-z](https://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html)"", and go to the ""mainboard"" tab.",it will show you most of the relevant information you're looking for there.,"[hwinfo](https://www.hwinfo.com/download/) is also another good piece of software that will show you more information about your motherboard, or any other piece of hardware in your pc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yep.,old pci / agp cards had the ability to also requisition system memory for video card memory.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yup, he has been talking to the wrong people apparently, updating the bios could introduce side channel patches and lower performance as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is updating it bad?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i will send the full motherboard picture,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i checked the j&w motherboard and it's looks like the mother a lot , the only difference is that the j&w motherboard is blue but the motherboard i sent is green , is the motherboard color important?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the worst case risk is you brick the machine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, but there's no functional reason to make an update either.","doing so subjects the board to the possibility of faulty bios, in which you will have no recourse to resolve.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"bricking older mobos with a bios update was not uncommon, i wouldn't risk it unless absolutely necessary",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hard to say.,could just be a slightly different revision.,could be intel simply rebranded the j&w board.,but then there should be a sticker or model on it somewhere with â€œd945â€ in it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, a whole 16gb here lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's also more dynamic now.,"back then you'd have to set aside some vram in the bios, but it wouldn't resize as system demand increased.","today, you can set a fixed size, usually 64mb-128mb, and the os/driver will claim more ram for video memory as needed.",task manager and resource monitor in windows can show this behavior in action.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

did your aio come with pre-installed tim?,if not perhaps the sticker or bad seating.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

couple things.,"i have this cooler and an i9, way better temps than you.",1- did your cooler come with the lga 1700 bracket?,"mine did not and i had to get it on the side

2- do you have the pump plugged into your aio pump fan header or your cpu_fan fan header?",it should be plugged in to the aio fan header on mobo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i remember you can reduce power draw in the cpu by like 25 or 50%.,"(iirc with amd, at least) with minimal performance loss.",maybe you can do the same with the new gen cpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is the thermal compound?,it had a small square of it.,but i plan on reapplying some when i reseat the pump just to make sure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am absolutely trying this when i figure out what seems to be going on with my cooler.,thank you so much for the specifics.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i canâ€™t seem to find these settings in my bios / where to alter the pl1/2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this was my first step.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok. i reseated absolutely every aspect of the cooler my shit is not jumping to 100 degrees at all anymore.,i'm too nervous to say (its fixed) but its looking supoer good.,ran cinebench ---got 29.7k....never touched 100 maaaaybe got close to 90 but for the most part stayed at 80. under 100 percent load.,i am about to place the side of the case back on....praying to hideo kojima that its fixed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i do have the lga 1700 brracket and i have my pump plugged into the cpu fan header located on the top right of the aorus elite ax.,this was actually one of my major fears.,some reading told me that it was actually fine to plug into the cpu fan header.,i have attatched a picture of the motherboard info.,i dont see anything detailing aio so i thought the cpu fan header option was the correct choice.,"mobo info here - if you could by chance correct me

there probably isn't enough pre-applied since the ihs is concave when mounted in the stock ilm in a low-pressure lga1200 retrofit mount.,you need to do the penta-dot method on lga1700.,you can probably undervolt it by 50mv and still be stable in video rendering.,but as usual: post your hwinfo64 sensor page when running the benchmark with package power and voltages visible and people can tell for sure what's going on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what's your board?,msi has it in advanced cpu configuration.,aorus is in advance cpu settings - turbo power limits,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
was the paste spread evenly when you took it off?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's a big improvement.,how are you doing the thermal paste application?,dot in the middle?,what are you running for your fan setup like which fans are intake / exhaust?,do you have any pics?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
according to your manual it's system fan 4 / pump on the bottom right.,"then you can go into bios and get to the smart fan 6 settings, and set that specific header to ""voltage"" mode that should put it at 100% suitable for pumps",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes.,"i have pictures in the thread, but i reapplied when i was doing the remount.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i reapplied thermal paste in an x with tiny dots in the blank spots.,i figured more is definitely better.,"i have 3 fans at the bottom blowing air on the gpu, fans on the side of the mobo blowing fresh air in, and the fan on the radiator at the top blowing air out.","i have debated reconfiguring some stuff around when i try to install the strimmer cables i got, but not sure moving fans is necessary.",i have posted a link to some pictures.,"\*(i still need to figure out how to change the color of the graphics card lol ignore that)

you posted the gpu power instead of the cpu power.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if your aio pump is in a header called cpu and not a dedicated aio header then go into bios and set the aio pump to 100% speed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah, found them.","well, there are empty spots at the corners but that probably shouldn't be affecting the temps as much unless it's an indication of of the cpu/ihs being deformed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no worries about the gpu!,most likely just the manufacturers third party app.,next time you re-seat your aio (when the replacement comes in) i would recommend the tubes on the bottom of the aio head.,"currently, they're on the right side, possibly blocking a ram slot, and could be creating a weird bend in the tubes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm hoping that's what it was but not 100% certain.,everything else registering ok in the nzxt software?,are you getting reports of cpu fan rpm?,is it being seated properly?,did you take rhe plastic off the bottom of the aio?,lol could be a few things hard to diagnose over the net but try to switch it up ajs see if it makes any diff!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i get around 40 at idle and the nzxt app lets me view the liquid in the pump and the rpms so i would imagine it is working?,although i tried to feel the pump hoses / pump and wasnâ€™t really â€œfeelingâ€ much?,not sure what to do.,you have been so so so helpful by the way.,thank you a ton.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was able to still detect the pump in bios and set the fan switch to voltage.,and turned it off of quiet mode.,but everything else is pretty much the same.,iâ€™ll look into getting an extension cable.,but iâ€™m very worried there is another issue,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the mount here looks decent so it's probably not a mounting issue,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what does the liquid temperature get to when it runs to 100c?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hoping the replacement will do the trick!,!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok thanks.,so iâ€™m assuming (if liquid temps arenâ€™t fluctuating) that perhaps there is an aspect of the aio not plugged in?,but all of the components appear to be working in software / visibly.,https://imgur.com/a/e7ixz52,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i will double check that in a couple hours when i return home.,this is my first time with a liquid aio.,i am having a inkling feeling that an aspect of the pump is not properly plugged in.,i will quadruple check everything when i get home.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ai have a very strong feeling that my liquid temps remain semi stagnant.,i could be wrong.,but if thatâ€™s the case.,iâ€™m wondering if an unconnected cord is perhaps not providing actual pump flow?,i have the header on the front of the motherboard clearly connected.,and the pump is detected by both my hardware and the scompanying software.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

your cpu and gpu throttles down when it gets too hot which reduces performance.,"this is normal for a laptop (no way you're cooling a 3070 at full speed with a tiny laptop heatsink), but if it recently got worse, and you haven't made your room hotter, double check that the cooling is ok and not clogged with dust, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i use throttlestop on the laptop to keep the cpu cool.,you can try repasting or getting cooling pad for your laptop.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the laptops around a year old, an i got it custom built from pc specialist (uk based pc builder) with upgraded thermal paste.",would the paste need replacing that soon or?,"ill have a look at throttlestop, would it effect performance?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ye exactly but i've seen some amazing builds with it i.e : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfaxxtd13c8&ab\_channel=pctechnician,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so you think an air cooler the the nh-15 is not enough?,better to go with a 360mm aio?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
140 mm btw,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think if i end up going for the air cooler i would have to get some low profile ddr5 ram to fit under it.,"the problem with the nh-15 is that i dont think there is any ddr5 ram that actually dose fit under it perfectly, think you will have to move it up just a bit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"\- going for a white build - so if you look at the z690 boards in sweden which are white its basically the same price so i spent a little extra just to get the z790 board

\- will be getting the 7900 xtx thats why its not on the list :) 

\- i agree but we can do both, going for a while build that's why things are a bit more on the pricey side but i got the dosh to splash :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
z790 offer much better ddr5 support and most have full w11 compatibility out of the box.,with a 690 you're looking at a need for an upgrade within the next 2-3 years at best.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ok, sure, but are you going to invest in that much customization?",because the out of the box experience is just not going to be that nice otherwise.,"also, most of the nicer looking options have a trade off, like the nzxt boards being only available with older chipsets right now or those maskings for the radiator likely affecting performance (which, i assume, you'll need every bit of for 13th gen).",i'm not saying these are bad options but you need to consider if that's what aligns with your priorities for the build.,"personally i feel like if you're going with 13700k/kf right now you are one of these 2 people:
1. someone who wants to be on the bleeding edge, regardless of anything else.",2. someone who needs a new pc asap for some reason and wants to future proof their build.,if you're in the 1st category you can go for the looks because you will most likely be upgrading your platform again in the next 1-2 years anyway.,however if you're in the 2nd you might need to consider function over form.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my $.02 - you would be fine with an air cooler on a 13700k in real world scenarios.,my 13600k is at 5.4 on an h150i and it's overkill for day to day usage.,i average about 60 after an hour stress testing with occt extreme large data set.,that's a realistic workload of \~130w.,in normal usage and gaming i am usually in the 40-50s.,220w on a 13600k is only going to happen if you're throwing something like prime95 small fft at it.,great tool if you want to find overclock instability in a short time but (in my opinion) i don't think you need to buy a cooling solution just to pass a stress test that puts double the power draw you would ever see in your actual usage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
absolutely what vrdubin6 said - prime95 is not a real world test scenario.,> great tool if you want to find overclock instability in a short time but (in my opinion) i don't think you need to buy a cooling solution just to pass a stress test that puts double the power draw you would ever see in your actual usage.,"this is great advice - even as i'm doing my oc as we speak i'm failing speeds that would probably be stable in games, so if you're not ""in to"" overclocking i guess, a 240mm would be ok.

for reference my 240mm afii is good enough for cooling 200w without hitting much of a sweat.",highly recommended aio - i've been using them since the i7 2600k days and have nothing but good words about them.,would highly recommend an aio if you've got a gpu that dumps air into the case (rather than a blower one),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ah ye it seems to do the job + its quiet its going to come down to how it looks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the non-led versions of corsair vengance and kingston's basic ones have a low enough profile that they should fit at least in the second slot.,i believe nh-15 also has the option to attach the front fan at different heights (to a degree) so you might be able to clear the memory regardless though it may slightly affect the cooling efficiency of the tower.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thatâ€™s completely false, the excellent ddr5 speeds raptor lake can hit are mostly because of the improved imc, and thereâ€™s absolutely no difference between the windows 11 support of the two chipsets (whatever the fuck *thatâ€™s* supposed to mean).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ah that's fantastic to know.,i think it will just come down to what looks the best really as both aio/air should be fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i've got the money to splash on the build but im waiting for the new amd cards to drop plus what i really want is for the new nzxt board to drop before the end of the year and that would be perfect for me.,thus then this build should last at least 5+ years,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"your $.02 was amazing :) its what i figured really, im not going to be doing anything crazy then just gaming and working on chrome etc so i think its perfectly fine - i guess i just need to see what i like better , the look of an aio or an air cooler ;) the only problem with the  nh-15 is how i cant show my ram off unless i go for something like nh-d15s or deepcool ak620 but i also would love to see some reviews on how loud they get when you game/ just work on chrome etc",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this was fantastic advice, and you're totally right.",did you get anywhere with small ftts?,can't really finding anyone testing with p95 on the internet and it's thrown my standard oc / stability testing regimen out the window.,i can hit 5.8ghz @ +0.05v but it throttles too often for me.,trying 5.7 @ -0.025 and it's still occasionally throttling so boutta try -0.05 next.,using the intel xtu stress test thing as prime95 is a howitzer for testing rather than a handgun now it seems.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ye  i think my ocd might kill me if the fan is higher at 1 point :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's not about the chipset itself.,the motherboards are newer so they are coming out with better compatibility for the new tech.,they support wider range of ram which is important if you will ever (and you probably will) need to replace your dice.,it can be surprisingly difficult to get ram compatible with a 4+ year old mobo if it wasn't chosen with that in mind.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so iâ€™ve only tested my 13700k/u12a in bf 2042 as rhat hits the cpu pretty hard.,iâ€™ve found that with the fans on full blast that the cpu got up to 78c and then tapered off in the mid 60s.,this is with mce on in the bios too so definitely not too shabby.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mines still not that good right now so iâ€™ll send a picture or whatever is easiest of them.,also iâ€™m gonna try to under volt my cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"google â€œthermalright cpu contact frame for lga 1700 â€œ

that sounds like a good plan.,"one thing to note is that the length of time a rig can last largely depends on longevity of components and maintained support from manufacturers, mainly for the motherboard via bios updates.",my longest running build got over 8 years and it was thanks to a combination of advance cpu tech (future proofing from intel at the time) and great support for the mobo (asrock).,"the things that aged the fastest were the gfx (duh) and the ram, i've even had hw failures on both of these components.","now, gfx is easy to replace but ram can be tricky due to compatibility.",i don't know how nzxt approaches it but make sure your choice has a large variety of compatible dice to ensure it will remain available for as long as you plan to use this pc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes and no.,i've already did some tests and undervoltage / underclocking attempts on the cpu and here are my results.,"when idle, the cpu does actively get into low frequency / c states and consume single digits of power.","when lightly loaded, the cpu actually pretty aggressively pushes towards the maximum frequency, leading to a voltage of around 1.4v by default and consumes about 30 - 40w when running light loads like browsing websites.","interestingly the cpu tends not to maintain an intermediate voltage and speed under a light load, no matter how i set the performance governor unless i put it into ""power"" mode, which locks the cpu at 800mhz.","it may be a motherboard bios bug or cpu driver bug, since this is quite different from what i saw on a 12th gen cpu.","the cpu vid voltage is sensetive to ia loadline settings, it got to 1.5v very easily under the ""standard"" 1.1mohm / 1.1mohm ac/dc loadline.","however, there are many reports that you can stable the cpu under stress at 0.2mohm ac loadline settings or even lower (with other voltage adjustments of course).","so with proper adjustment, the cpu can be a lot less power-hungry.","i personally prefers stability so i use 0.5mohm / 0.9mohm, and set the loadline calibration to ""turbo"" on a gigabyte mobo.","this gives a nearly consistant vcore voltage of about 1.31-1.32v under stress up to 400w at p5.5g-e4.3g frequency settings, and it is completely stable.","under this settings, you can get about 25w power consumption when doing light-load tasks.",downclocking has a significant impact on the cpu power consumption.,"under the same workload (a matlab program), the cpu consumes about 210w when running at p5.5g - e4.3g (1.10v), but it only consumes 110w when running at p4.5g - e3.6g, and about 75w at p3.9g - e3.2g (0.99v).","it's very easy to cool the cpu at such a low power consumption, and light load the latter consumes about 10w.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

mce or multicore enhancement lifts all power restrictions so it can go higher than intels 253w limit.,which would ultimately make your cpu go straight to 100c and throttle down,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes!,its always good to plug in both if you have both connectors.,not that you specifically need it but it doesn't harm anything and it will take power if it needs to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, pl1 and pl2 for 13900k should both be 253w.",if it shows more than that then that means a motherboard setting or the setting itself is not stock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i go both with 125w,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that...is a bad idea.,125w is the base wattage needed for the base clocks.,that means it will barely boost.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"okay how bad is 125 watt i mean benchmark would little fps drop likely 3 to 5 fps, itâ€™s very worth it?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
125 is base clock.,which means that the clocks will drop to 3ghz.,and 2ghz on e cores.,if you do that then there is literally no point in getting the 13900k.,youâ€™d go from 38000 on cinebench to a 32000. absolutely you will be able to tell the difference.,which is why intel specifically has pl1 at 253 watts.,i,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
125 watts is the base pl1 intel setting.,motherboard manufactures are setting this higher on their boards.,"my asus board sets it at 253 watts, but some boards set it at unlimited.",https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/230496/intel-core-i913900k-processor-36m-cache-up-to-5-80-ghz/specifications.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have the same cooler on mine with similar results.,only in benchmarks was it getting that hot.,gaming was in the 60s.,i lowered the core voltage in the bios and cinebench hits 70c now instead of 100c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13700k here.,i had the ak620 before and it would hit 100c during cinebench multicore.,i swapped to the akâ€™s bigger brother the assassin iii plus the thermalright frame and now i only hit 89c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"same setup here, are you perhaps using an msi motherboard too?","what fixed it for me was changing the bios setting called cpu lite load from the default mode 12 to mode 9. not only did it lower temps to about 76â° in cinebench max load, it also lowered power consumption, and even increased my score to 24k stock!",the p cores stay locked at 5.1 ghz now no sweat.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
might be worthwhile to check if the voltage and wattage are too high.,"ak620 should be okay for a 13600k, especially if you are not pushing it to its very limit (like not doing heavy multithreaded tasks all the time).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2. changed the following under oc / advanced cpu configuration:
- cpu cooler tuning: boxed cooler
- cpu lite mode: mode 2 (default is 9/12)
- enhanced turbo: disabled

note: dropping the cpu lite load can cause instability (crashing, bsod) so if you experience this turn it back up +1 and retry until you no longer crash.","i did not test this personally, but i didn't see a massive performance loss overall.",maybe around ~20 fps in mw2; i still typically get 160+ on a 144hz monitor so that loss isn't big for me.,you can see the performance tests for various cpu lite modes at 3:20 on this video: https://youtu.be/-mkavitzoly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there are a bunch of issues with that chip dating over the last year.,i just joined the club of sufferers.,https://www.reddit.com/r/intel/comments/lqb4km/for_people_having_i225v_connection_issues/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
first attempt at a video like this.,pretty happy with the results.,even pretty decent gains in dx11 titles.,used dxvk-async.,i recorded it with different pc so should be not fps loss.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
those temps definitely arenâ€™t normal.,seems like it would have to be the aio mounting having bad contact or the pump isnâ€™t working since you are barely hitting 200w.,is this a new aio or is it from a previous machine?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there's probably issue with the mount.,"after taking out the pump from the cpu assembly, have you observed the pattern on the ihs that gives an impression that the pump is making good contact with the cpu ?",i am too on the msi z690 force wifi and the 13900k but with the galahad 360 and the frame retrofit from thermalright.,idle at 38-40c and during gaming it hovers around 55-60c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so mine definitely isnt as bad as this but definitely get a contact frame.,before on stock turbo/power limits on a 10 min throttle test i get 77-86c with the hottest core being 89-91. when before contact frame i was getting hottest cores to 96-100 after a couple minutes.,yours definitely sounds like a mounting issue,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i highly recommend spending $15 and installing a contact frame, i have the same h150i with a contact frame and hydronaut extreme and iâ€™m getting overall cooler loadouts.",make sure to spread your paste.,i removed the stock paste on the h150i.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"previous aio that i was using on a 9700k and just kept for the i9, bios shows the pump rpm is accurate so i know that's working at least.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm going to try repasting again once an order of arctic silver comes in and i'll take a closer look then.,i made sure to tighten the screws in a hex pattern and the pump doesn't wiggle or move when screwed down so maybe it's a pasting issue.,might look into the frame retrofit too since it can't hurt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is [this](https://www.amazon.com/thermalright-retrofit-anti-bending-generation-grey/dp/b0b9rylbmq/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=23mso6ej6yniz&keywords=cpu%2bcontact%2bframe&qid=1667931964&sprefix=cpu%2bcontact%2bframe%2caps%2c76&sr=8-1-spons&th=1) the frame you're using?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok yeah most likely the mounting then,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how old is the aio?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
definitely feeling that way now.,gonna try repasting with some arctic silver and maybe look into a contact frame for it also.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i would definitely make sure every thing seems right with the backplate and standoffs for the mount while you are at it.,your temps are so far off it sounds like itâ€™s barely making contact.,since you had to buy the retrofit kit i would be wary of something being up with that.,also would take the advice of u/nereush about the thermal paste imprint on the ihs and block when you take it off.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did happen to notice something about all the retrofit kit videos i saw online.,"folks installing the new standoffs were all using [this](https://i.imgur.com/wmaxbkx.png) type of backplate, whereas the one that came with my aio look like [this one](https://i.imgur.com/19hj7qz.png), wonder if that could be a factor...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i bet that might be it.,in the complete kit i don't see that backplate.,"https://www.corsair.com/us/en/categories/products/accessories-%7c-parts/pc-components/cooling/elite-series-retention-kit/p/cw-8960093

from a video of the retrofit kit i watched it looks like the standoffs should end up completely flush with the board when screwed in.",are yours?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i don't recall them being completely flush, i only screwed them in once but i wanna say i remember them still having some space between them and the board.",i researched around about standoff/backplate wiggle for aios and most folks said it'll be fine once you screw the pump down.,definitely something else for me to check.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is the video at around 2:30 in he is screwing them in and they are flush.",i think if yours aren't flush with the board the problem would be that when you screw the block/pump down it would be sitting too high above the ihs and wouldn't make good contact,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

mine is until i go over 60 fps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1) total cost so far is around 1944.94 adding everything up.,2) you can def use an nvidia gpu but you must take the size of your card into consideration.,only real downside to itx.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"alright iâ€™ll probably be okay then, thanks fro the help",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this sub is low traffic enough that i think automod response to tech support tag is enough.,"any tech support tag with ""temperature/temps"" in it should have automod telling the poster to include hwinfo64 sensor screenshots of voltage and power sections which would cut short most of those threads",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as a casual reader, i don't find an issue with the current state of posts here.",some other subs seem to sway far from their original purpose.,"however here, i find the tech support / build posts / news equally posted.",there can't be news everyday on intel so why not have build/tech posts.,"and when there is new news or major news, it gains top post anyways.",my two cents.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i don't mind the tech support posts, but would love if we could restrict posts about game promotions to a single post.","all i seem to read is people whining, and it happens every single time intel runs a game promotion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i prefer people making posts about their tech problems.,"also those dedicated threads don't get as much if any visits from regular users, so it will just frustrate people who need help.","leave the posts, if people find them annoying then they should add a filter that filters out tech support labeled posts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think those posts are welcome.,"there isn't a ton of traffic here anyways, i don't see big news getting drowned out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i agree with you (the ""google effect"" is especially insightful -- google used to help you find information, now it tries to sell you stuff).",a key question is: are people enjoying r/intel?,"i think they are, and like the gabfest of the tech support posts.",an example of a tech question that perhaps intel employees would be uncomfortable answering is: are those aluminum cpu retention blocks worthwhile?,it turns out they are.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am with the op on this and have pretty much the same opinion.,i like people to be able to google issues and be able to find reddit posts for the issue and a discussion about it.,much faster and easier that way.,also people are also more likely to join or be interested in this subreddit that are searching for a solution to their problem and stumble apon this subred.,that's actually how i found it when i started out on reddit when i wanted to make sure my temps were okay on my first build.,the news and big posts like others have said have always been in my feed and on this subreddit in particular i see them near or at the top every time im on here.,"for me it always filters ""hot posts"" by default too, but there is always people like me that look under new when i have free time to help others and top when i want to look over stuff i missed.",if they didn't have those filters or it defaulted to new only i can understand more of why in this sub it would be a bigger issue.,i'm just not a fan of megathreads as i never get responses and my question/issue is never posted for others other then in that megathread which after little time will be lost down the line.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe additional sub-reddits would work.,"something like amd_support, nvidia_support, and intel_support.",seems kind of counter intuitive to lump all support questions into a single sub-reddit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i personally donâ€™t support entirely removing tech support threads, but i also donâ€™t feel that completely irrelevant threads (where the question or issue is clearly unrelated to an intel product) should necessarily be supported - and should continue to be redirected to the appropriate sub.","i enjoy answering intel-focused tech and support questions here, and do not find that the quantity of those â€œdrowns outâ€ intel-related news and reviews.","perhaps that situation might change in the future, but i donâ€™t feel thatâ€™s the case today.","were this to become a pure intel press release / review sub, i know my own participation would fall way offâ€¦ although that might be a positive in some cases!",:),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think creating a seperate sister sub for tech support or discussion about intel products would be best way.,that way tech support wont get mixed with discussion about intel products and vice versa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
proposition: add a rule where the tech support must be intel related (eg.,"**not** being able to post *can i use this 550w evga psu with my rtx 3070*, but asking something like *rtx 3060 ti vs arc a770* would be allowed)

to make sure everything in r/intel is actually, ya know, intel related

(youâ€™d also be able to post build help questions as long as they contain intel parts, not like an r5 5600 with a rtx 3060)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i agree to this change,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i no longer even bother checking this sub lately or posting too it, everything just gets drowned out by these questions and support threads.",i support this change.,we could have these basic questions/tech support posts put in a megathread and someone could actually update the /r/intel wiki to include helpful information and faqs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tech support posts are fine.,it's hardly ever going to happen where a 20upvote tech post drowns out a 2000 upvote intel arc series new product launch.,"or the multitude of posts regarding contact plates for 12 and 13th gen.

leave tech support posts alone


let the community downvote them into oblivion if they choose.... :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the rule change might encourage more discussion about intel and its products and less hardware questions and i for one would appreciate less of those.,there are other subreddits and sites for support.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
agreed.,"i think a sub with \~20 viable submissions every 24 hours is perfectly capable of addressing them individually, without condemning every support question to the black hole which is the official support post.","i'd feel differently if the intel reps were more hands on, but punting everything to website support tickets isn't solving anything for *this* particular community.","i don't think anyone expects them to be able to directly address tougher questions, but they're severely hamstrung in the solutions they can provide.","as far as the sub as a whole, there are absolutely low effort posts; an enhanced automod for basic tech support or build questions certainly isn't the worst idea, but more often than not the answer to these wayward users is simple and quick, and a quick thirty second post detailing an easy fix can make someone's day.",the amd sub has twice as many subscribers and four times the number of active users.,"they're going to get a flood of questionable posts, and boy do they.",that type of hands-on cat herding doesn't seem necessary here.,i'd even go so far as to suggest that the splitting off the intel arc gpus into [their own sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/intelarc/) is counterproductive.,"far fewer eyes on the problems (which may be intentional), and driver updates and news *still* end up cross posted to the intel sub (typically with zero context or additional useful discussion information).",engagement builds community.,"if that means taking a few seconds to scroll by a disinteresting post here and there, i'll take the tradeoff.","even if i have to wade through two weeks of call of duty code redemption bitching (my code finally worked, too, so i do commiserate a bit).","post enjoyable, informative things, earnest questions and have good discussions.",don't be a dickâ„¢,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i agree, i don't post much but i check daily and get a lot of news here, and learn a lot from the tech support/build threads as well

all you gotta do is sort by new once per day and you usually have the perfect 1 full page of new threads to sift through",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't really like the megathreads either.,i feel like they alienate the posters and make it harder for people to get their answers.,"there are even discords to shove tech support questions to on some sub-reddits, but i don't think those are very helpful either.",i rarely get an answer in them.,"and like the other person before me said, it makes it hard to find previous answers.",the megathread stuff that's answered won't show up under things like google/reddit search very often.,this sub-reddit isn't very busy anyway.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
those threads also make it really hard to go back and find answers in the future.,having the topic in the post title really helps for search/seo.,a comment thread on an obscure question may never re-surface.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, that thing is a dinosaur",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we have a lot of pcs like that in my work's office.,"sure, you can do some programming and office stuff in it ( i do) , but changing the hdd to a ssd is the main thing apart from the ram.","so i say... yeah, go for it, but don't expect it to remain usefull for 10 years, consider it a temporal machine and you will be just fine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

a 8 year old 4th gen haswell laptop's still better than those cheap atom-based laptops with 32gb or 64gb of soldiered-on non-upgradeable emmc.,i'm saying this from first hand experience since i had such a cheap laptop with a pentium silver with only a 32gb emmc and i ended up replacing it with a second-hand dell latitude laptop that too has a haswell i-3 with 8gb ddr3 and a 500gb ssd.,hopefully this will change in the future when cheap laptops have gracement-based intel or amd zen-2 based mendocino with 128gb or better storage.,"of course your 4th gen laptop isn't officially supported by windows 11, which isn't much of an issue if you intend to run windows 10 or linux.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

which motherboard?,there are dozens of b660 motherboards.,"some will handle it perfectly fine, some will throttle due to high vrm temps.",you also wouldn't be losing ddr5 as there are b660 boards with ddr5 if that's what you want.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
b660 as a chipset supports ddr5.,you just have to buy the right model board.,and what the heck does he mean by â€œbottleneckâ€?,using that terminology implies a design that limits performance by imposing an insufficient bandwidth limitation.,is he referring to most b660 boards having crappy vrms?,"thatâ€™s not 13th gen specific, however.",and there are z690/z790 boards also with crappy vrms.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just get an entry-level z690, the gigabyte z690 ud is down to $130-140 now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if using a intel prozrssor with a k you should use a z motherboard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"aorus pro ax b660m is my option, as it has a shielded vrm and seems to have the best set i could find on the form factor (matx) for the price.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i know and according to him its because of poor vrms and throttling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it has to be microatx :(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[gigabyte b660m aorus pro ax can handle 12900k without throttling.,"](https://youtu.be/pea0vcj0lry?t=789) and [13600k consumes about 30w less than 12900k](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/intel-core-i9-13900k-i5-13600k-cpu-review/4), that means the motherboard will handle 13600k with ease.",b660 motherboards need a bios update to support 13th gen but this model has q-flash plus onboard button so you can update it even without a cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s never a good idea to pair a k series cpu with a bx60 series board.,"there are a couple of halfway decent ones, but they do lack ddr5 and pcie 5. and bios flashback for 13th gen. there are also some middling ones that should be able to manage a 13600k without significantly throttling power, however they likely still lack bios flashback which makes them a bad choice for 13th gen at this time.","honestly, if youâ€™re on a budget, just get a decent z690 like the msi z690-a.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for this reply bud.,i don't really intend to overclock as honestly the gains are low.,but cost/performance the 13600k reigns king,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hello,

what'a about thee b660 gaming x ax ddr4 ?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
im not really on a budget but i want the most decent micro atx possible without jumping to the enthusiast level.,"i dont really care about pci5 as none of my devices is, nor for ddr5 as for my use a 3600 kit will do enough.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what exactly is your budget?,those might not be your only options.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why not spend the extra 20 or so dollars on a 12th gen i3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for everyday tasks and office 365 it wont matter.,"get which has better ram (8gb at least), enough storage, and 1080p res.",also if the brand has good longevity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would say they are about equal.,"while the 8th gen i5 has more physical cores, the 10th gen i3 has hyperthreading and is two generations newer.","if i had to pick, i would go with the i3 because it is newer.",that might become helpful in the future.,perhaps it would also be wise to expand your search.,a lot of budget laptops were fitted with ryzen cpus.,"unless you have specific reasons for needing an intel based laptop, i would include ryzen based laptops as well.",with you budget you can't afford to be picky.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"8th gen i5's don't have hyperthreading, 10th gen i3's do.","this means that even though the i3 has less cores, it still has more threads compared to the i5 (8 vs 6).","single threaded performance is also better on 10th gen, so i'd easily recommend that over the i5.","sometimes the ryzen 5 5500 sells for the same price as the 10100f, if you don't mind buying amd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i3 10th.,same performance and ample room to upgrade in the future.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd go with the i5 8th gen because it has more power than the i3.,but if you want something newer i'd check for some used i5's or maybe you can get a discount somwhere,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 i suspect it will but the motherboard may need a bios update.,"like this person mentions and iâ€™ve experienced as well, the documented max memory isnâ€™t always the actual max it could support in the future when there is ram with higher capacity than is available today.",https://vi-control.net/community/threads/new-computer-with-256gb-ram-support-getting-confused-anyone-could-help.118841/post-5002663,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just get a xeon lmao,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what are you doing that it makes more sense to use a i9 than a threadripper or intel equivalent that needs 256 gigs or ram,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you have workloads that honestly need that much ram, you should be getting a xeon or threadripper.",i imagine in the future we'll see that max memory go up though.,whether it's on the 13900k or 14/15th gen is another story.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sounds to me 2nd hand xeon epyc is better if you need 256 gb ram,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in the past when intel added new memory formats they also doubled the eventual memory capacity.,for example skylake was 32gb with ddr3 and 64 gb ddr4 (increasing to 128gb with the refreshes).,"probably once dimms are available 256 gb will work, although likely requiring a bios update.","fwiw if you need large memory capacity, and you're paying that much for ram anyway, might be better to look at quad channel options since it'll be a while before bigger dimms are both available and then not insanely expensive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
overkillllll,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no intel only supports 128 gigabytes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't think we will see that.,the memory controller is having issues just running 128 gib.,64 gib is the most you can do without losing a lot of performance (zen4 is even worse in that respect).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably have to wait for a hedt version for that to become reality.,"while maximum stated memory, especially by motherboards, can often be increased as larger modules become available, it all depends on what the cpu is capable of addressing.","considering the pentium pro was capable of addressing 64gb in 1995, it does seem unlikely that intelâ€™s stated maximum of 128gb for 12th/13th gen isâ€¦ architectural?",but i donâ€™t know that itâ€™s been documented anywhere?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think intel will bring back hedt lineup if they feel there's a market for 256gigs of ram on ""consumer-ish"" (not xeon) platforms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unlikely.,you may see it supported on a new processor in a couple of years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

jesus.,so basically it is more economic to go i9 and you need the ram instead of threadripper.,hope it works out at the end and that 13gen does get support for 256 gigs of ram,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's 125w and 253w.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
125w is the base watts for the processing speed.,that means if you set it to 125w then you will only get base clocks which is extremely low.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

could maybe be psu but its corsair ax1600i and 3090 puts way more stress on it compared to cpu and i have even tried loading both cpu and gpu 100% to draw as much power from psu as possible and encountered no issues.","seems to be only some workloads on 100% that cause bsod, the unpacking of that software (inconsistent, got bsod two times in many tries), compiling of shaders at first startup of detroit become human (another inconsistent as it took a lot of repeat compilings at 100% cpu usage to trigger another bsod) and furmark cpu burner which fails almost every time and usually fails fast.","short testing with each ooct tests (like 15-20 minutes per test and instructions set and data types) doesn't cause bsod, compressing or decompressing 7z files at highest compression also hasn't caused any issues so far even when it pins cpu to 100%.","done some compiling in unreal and unity (usually compiles very fast so not a long test) and haven't had any issue at 100% usage, same with adobe after effects, from time to time it loads cpu to 100% for a short time and so far no crashes.",done approx.,"3 hours of video encoding using only cpu without any gpu acceleration and no crashes at all....

&#x200b;

something in those few workloads (especially the cpu burner) causes my system to crash while other 100% usage workloads don't cause any issues.","&#x200b;

the only other issue i had with this system (besides bsods) was with windows 10 fast startup basically, while fast startup was enabled often after shutting down the system and turning it back on i would be greeted to 3 different errors in event viewer (something about system not being shutdown properly and another about fast startup failing, cant remember third one) but after reading a bit those errors were common for fast startup and everyone just recommends to disable it so that's what i did and those errors disappeared.","&#x200b;

edit: forgot to mention, absolutely no issues during normal gaming, no random crashes or freezes or anything like that, overwatch at uncapped fps at pushes gpu to 100% all the time and cpu around 50-60% and not a single crash playing for hours without break.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"might be worth wiping and reinstalling windows, if you haven't tried yet (sorry i skimmed through the post so if you already did that, disregard lil ol me) just throwing it out there cause windows 10 was buggy af for me, even with a clean install of pro version.","but now that i'm on win 11 it's been much more stable, haven't had a single bsod (ironically) though i only updated after optimizations were made for ryzen cpus since i have an r5 5600",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

just checked the website and when entering the batch number cpu is shown to have until november 13 until warranty expires (i bought it on november 20) so looks like i don't have much time left to figure out if cpu is 100% issue.,going to run some more tests a then contact them if issues continue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just ran diagnostic tool today few times and it passed each time

temps are different depending on test but for example h264 stability test ran at about 80-95 while some other test ran much cooler, i can do more temp measuring if needed",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks for the link to the software, i will try that out tomorrow (almost 6am in my timezone right now)

to answer your questions, no overclocks, just stock msi motherboard settings (first time  entering bios it asked me what type of cooler i have and i selected 360mm aio as that is what i have and only enabled xmp)

temperatures seem ok, i can give you exact temps tomorrow when i wake up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"temps are different for each test, some test barley reach 80c, some go up to 90 and worst test was 100c (which i let run for two hours and havent had any crashes) while detroit shader compiling crashed after few minutes at like 75c

i have windows on my current 1tb ssd but i salvaged a small ssd from old laptop so i will try to install windows on it for resting purpose (so i dont have to nuke my current install just for diagnostic)

i will double check to make sure my bios is latest.","&#x200b;

if it turns out it is something hardware related i guess its gonna be pain to diagnose...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, tried stressing ram while running cinebench and it was stable (at least for 30-60 minutes i let it run)

furmark has its own cpu stress test too and thats the one that crashes most often, running just furmark and stressing just gpu doesnt cause problems, its only when stressing cpu using furmarks included cpu burner and those few other cases mentioned in the post, i tried heat stressing and heat seems to make no difference so i dont belive its heat related, cpu burner can crash it literally in a minute sometimes even on cold boot before components had any chance to heat up

&#x200b;

yes, running g.skill trident z rgb 64gb at 3600mhz (xmp) its 4 sticks 16gb each all from the same kit

i forgot to stress cpu without xmp, i should have probably done that earlier, gonna do this later today",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for some stupid reason thats the one thing i forgot, i will try it later today and see if there is any difference",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's worth noting memtest86 is pretty meh as far as ram stability test goes.,it will tell you if ram is bad but can easily let ram that's not quite stable pass.,temp can also affect ram stability so something can easily pass a low load mem test but fail when the internal case temp heats up.,if it was me and i suspected cpu the first thing i'd do is a manual voltage offset and add 20mv or .025v if that made blue screening go away when full cpu load then it may be your cpu.,if not then i'd want to start checking other things.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this is my next step, i have been avoiding it as i would need to setup lots of stuff again but i took apart an old laptop few days ago and harvested a cheap 250gb ssd so i am probably going to end up unplugging both my samsung ssds and pop in this cheap small one just for testing without having to touch my existing install",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, i did hear it is rare but can happen, that's why i am trying to figure out exactly what's wrong and also my warranty options in case it really is the cpu.",in case it is the cpu i hope they still have 10900k stock for replacement...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
where did you find a batch chrcker and serial?,"without lifting the cpu out

is this in cpu-z or something?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks, gonna try with voltage and see if anything changes.","&#x200b;

running the test from cold boot when system hasnt even gotten chance to heat up still can crash the system in a minute, some other tests that absolutely torture temperature are 100% stable so im not sure its temp related",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sticker on cpu box has serial and batch number, if you dont have the box you will probably need to remove the cooler and clean up the thermal paste on cpu to read it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if adding 25mv or even 50 doesn't fix the issue the cpu may be less likely.,it could definitely still be it even if a little voltage doesn't fix it.,but if it does fix it i'd still use the warranty as a cpu should not need more then stock voltage at stock clocks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

most motherboards that you would use with a 13700k would have bios flashback,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is no change in the dmi interface (cpu to pch communications) between z690 and z790.,"the only change is on z790, 8 chipset-based pcie 3.0 lanes were upgraded to 4.0. there arenâ€™t even additional lanes, itâ€™s just that some are faster.",but still bottlenecked behind the same dmi speed equivalent of pcie 4.0 x8.,"there are also some changes to native usb ports supported by the chipset, but oems rarely limit themselves to only chipset ports anyways.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"so just letting you know, stock pl1 for 13900k is 253 watts with pl2 which is 253w.",alder lake was 125w.,you shouldnt mess with pl1 but what you should do is enforce intel limits.,on asus its called multicore enhancement.,no idea what its called on aorus.,these chips run super hot anyway.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

your psu might be an issue?,you can limit the power draw on the cpu.,you can try a psu calculator.,during gaming the cpu probably won't draw as much power as it does in a benchmark.,260w in a bench mark?,cooling 260w is also quite a chore so you might have to limit the power draw anyways.,z790 mainboards don't require bios updates but they are relatively expensive.,b and other series  mainboards should come out later.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

do you need a contact frame if your cooler had a lga1700 mounting bracket?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s not needed on the 13900k and z790 boards.,does nothing.,they fixed the issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i appreciate all the responses.,i have ordered the tg frame and will go for it.,one final question though.,has anyone had issues mounting your coolers backplate and ultimately the cooler itself while using a contact frame?,i found a couple of users reporting this problem while scouring the net for info about the frame.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my problem is that i could only get the screws opposite to each other to screw in!,idk why?,but my temps are still better then before,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for response.,yes 8 degrees is worth it.,iâ€™m thinking i should prob get one ordered.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how was the installation of the contact frame for you?,"i tried to install it today on my 13900kf, asus z790 maximus hero, and eventually gave up.",i found the frame rocked back and forward lengthwise which prevented it from actually screwing into the backplate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what mobo?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what mobo?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah i'm getting the deepcool ak620 which also has a convex base, iirc jesus steve mentioned something along the lines of the frame at least not being as relevant",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™m running a 13600k and an ak620, which also has a convex plate.",i actually saw temps drop anywhere from  4-6 degrees when using the tg contact frame.,edit: will most likely vary from mobo to mobo though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
both.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the stock contact frame is that tension rod thingy, the reason why people use these new ones is because the stock configuration doesnâ€™t apply even pressure, so either cooler doesnâ€™t work as well as it would if the cpu was flat.",seems to be worth it to lower your cpu temps a few degrees,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the contact frame is a replacement for the stock ilm (the thing on the motherboard that holds your cpu in the socket that has the little lever).,"the reason people use it instead is the stock ilm doesn't apply even pressure to the cpu, so your cooler's cold plate gets less direct contact due to the imperfect pressure by the ilm.",these contact frames amend it by having pressure on all sides of the cpu heatspreader.,it works for both air and aio coolers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tg is made in germany with high labor costs.,tr is made in china.,i'd have gone tg if i could have found one for normal price just to support them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"interesting, i've seen people who say that for noctua coolers it won't be much of a difference because of their convex base.",do you think the nh-u12a will also get similar results?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well shit, my 13900k with unlimited power setting (+300w), gets 40500 points from cinebench, it hits max 94c with 360m aio, without using contact frame.",so contact frame isnt a must for every scenario..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
today i learned iâ€™m a frameless failure with my 13900k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that one looks like a total nightmare - if it's the one i'm thinking of it uses liquid metal and aims to create a seal, a bit like the ps5 cooling solution.",seemed way too risky/complex to me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the frame is a totally different thing.,whether or not you need it is up to you.,go to youtube and watch gamerznexus video on the frames and youâ€™ll get a better picture of what they do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you have evidence of this?,i've got a z790 board and a 13900k and have been debating installing one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,intel released a statement that doesnâ€™t actually acknowledge the issue and says their procs are running within spec on z790 boards.,they did not fix the issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have the cheaper thermalright, and that is very straightforward as it makes direct contact with the mobo.","the tg version however does not, hence it is possible to overtighten and damage the pins.","gn has a great segment on both frames, incl.",installation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i used one for the first time while installing the block for a custom loop - only real advice is to have the cpu installed using the stock ilm, remove the stock ilm, and install the contact frame.","using the thermalright one, had no (more) issues that normal, with an ek magnitude block.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the plate moves around.,you're supposed to drop it fully in place and then secure all 4. starting diagonally.,otherwise there's no point in using it as it'll be uneven.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you watch the gamersnexus video on it, theres a section where someone shows you how to install it correctly because the instructions it comes with is really vague.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
interesting.,i had the same problem with the thermal grizzly frame.,the thermalright one gave me no problems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your back plate was upside down.,i had the same problem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you have experience with some high end cpu or full monoblocks with the easy mount backplate for a simple example, then this will make sense, but it's not difficult, but likely there is that ah ha moment.","i have 13900k and for sure i need to get one of these plates asap, i also plan to go with delid and direct-die liquid metal as i managed to score a killer sample on my 1st try!","back to the subject though, i have changed many contact plates on servers low end to super high end boards, though never for this reason, so i'm confident this will apply...

ok so what most people do even if they know you must do it diagnol to screw it in, its not quite that simple.. although i do own a .06nm torque driver which will be helpful but same as with backplates, just because you place screws in diagnol does not mean you can do it in 2 tries per screw... patience... get it on there and do not come close to your final tightening until the very end, i make about 10-15 rounds on each screw like 1 revolution or a half of one diagnol, repeat.","this way it will be even and you can adjust it on its way down and will be loose at first but when you get to that final point and its lined up properly you simply tighten the first one to the fullest and diagnol with the torque driver its like slight movement and then click, across, slight 1/5 turn click, and so forth, this method takes an extra 4 minutes and saves hours of unneeded headaches or potential damage..

when i swap cpu's or add a block for a build for a customer or my own pretty much monthly i learned from my neighbor who is electrical engeneer and super smart, he doesn't do much with computers but still knows all about them, and his friends all play with ln2 and even liquid helium.. they work at a nucluear plant so im sure tools and space is easy to come by as supplies!","the best tip i got from him though on mounting blocks was that his friends use a dental mirror, a two man job and apply super light amounts of paste on ihs when they use them, but they mount the blocks so even by using the dental mirror and some kind of borescope or something endoscope maybe, but they go around all sides and carefully view how high off the block each side is and also where the thermal paste is moving to first to counteract it.. they claim that alone makes an 8-10c minimum difference just on an aio over most peoples mounting... the magnification wouldnot  be needed but the mirror could also probably assist in this procedure!","i am about to order mine today and i can report better and shorter results...

that said, given i have experience should i go with the thermal grizzly or no?","i use their products proudly, but not too proud to find a plate that does the same job for much less money... no offense to steve from gn, i appreciate the fact he leaves nothing in the wind, and is very thourough just really tests things to their absolute fullest possible extent and i just have a hard time watching all that sometimes id like to see jay do a video on it, but hey, ill still check out steves videos  too... idk.. any input is appreciated if none i understand and i will manage, just thought id ask while tossing in my 9 cents.. lol.. sorry for the tldr..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just note, thermalright and thermal grizzly both offer contact frames.","me being super paranoid of ruining a brand new 13th gen i9 i went with the thermal grizzly, but iâ€™ve heard and seen from multiple reviewers and other xoc enthusiasts that the thermalright works amazing as well and is like 3x cheaper than the thermal grizzly!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i had no issues installing at all, following the gamers nexus video, there are multiple steps to making sure youâ€™re applying the right amount of force and applying it correctly.",did you install it with the mount for your water cooler or aio screwed in to hold the backplate stable while you installed the contact frame?,that was a huge help for me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i didn't install with the aio backplate in place but realized that would help keep things in place.,it was all a bit nerve racking at the point at which it rocked as i didn't want to damage any equipment.,i'll try again in a few weeks once i snag an arctic lf ii and swap out my current corsair h150i.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if you overtighten the grizzly you can actually damage your pins if youâ€™re a gorilla.,if you do that to the thermal right it stops you by touching the board.,not everyone has a torque wrench for a maximum of 0.6nm.,i know bauer plays this off like rtfm but not everyone is careful enough not to cause damage.,"source: i have both frames and the results are the same, but iâ€™m only confident recommending the thermal right to my casual friends.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i see i see, i just use the thermal grizzly installation video that was recommended to me and havenâ€™t had any issues and iâ€™ve used it on a 12900k, 12900ks, and 13900k respectively on the same board and never had issues, noted for the future though whenever iâ€™m asked if contact frames help.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that sounds way safer.,ordered one.,"i just tighten it evenly until you can't do it anymore (well, not with insane pressure, just with the fingers i guess?)",and it will eventually stop?,"using arctic freezer ii 420, i guess the temps should drop on that one seeing as many other people that get good temp reductions are using the same cooler.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah if youâ€™re attentive and or an extreme ln2 overclocker the grizz is fine and maybe the only option for ln2.,but the right is just well designed idiotproof-ness.,although it wouldnâ€™t do well on ln2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

set a pl2 power limit in the bios?,cpu can pull a lot of power.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the asus ruyo (ii) has a problems with [the cpu thermal sensors](https://youtu.be/t2s7zthhsom) while controlling its fans speed.,how do you monitor the cpu temps?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you want to avoid power spiked in windows os change power mode to balanced/better efficiency .,in biod you can try decreasing pl2 limit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
interesting!,had an i9-9900k before and it always was around \~36â°c when idle and not over \~80â°c with intense gaming sessions.,but it usually had those two degrees.,"the 13900k now just randomly jumps to 50, 60 or even 70 when just doing normal tasks",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good call!,need to google how i can to that with my asus mainboard.,it's my first one and i am not that well versed technically tbh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"new node, hybrid architecture and a lot higher ipc.",things have changed and by that the cpu behaviors when it comes to that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you may need to disable undervolt protection in bios to undervolt in runtime.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if your goal is to decrease peak power consumption, decrease pl2 limit insted of under volting.",undervolting can make your system unstable.,decreasing pl2 will not lead to unstable system.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks but i don't think i want to try that again.,i tried to offset in bios and after saving the changes my pc went into a loop where it would constantly turn on by itself even after unplugging and plugging it.,i had to take out the cmos battery for it to stop.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i want to decrease the core voltage so my cpu doesn't overheat.,i'm worried that my cpu won't last too long since i'm getting temps at around 80-90â°c while at ~40% usage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you have multicore enhancement turned **on** or **off** in your bios?it's in ai tweaker on asus motherboards.,that is **set to on/auto by default** for many motherboards (including mine) .,i have an asus z790 extreme and it was on **auto by default** causing my cpu to go above the tdp limit of 253w.,"i was easily hitting 323w during a cinebench test, with 100c on 4 cores instantly.",pretty insane.,"after i set it to '**disabled - enforce all limits**', my max tdp during a cinebench test was 253w.","and my hottest temp was 97c on 1 of the cores and 93 on 2 others, 80-85c on the rest.","so definitely make sure you check if that is it on or off, turning it off should decrease some temps, it did for me anyway :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have already found a solution.,i switched cpu lite load from mode 9 to mode 5 and it runs waaaaay cooler but thanks i'm gonna check it out anyways :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
robert noyce should be of the notoriety of elon musk.,"unfortunately, he is not.",this video is dedicated to him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not exactly what youâ€™re asking for but i found power limiting it to be extremely effective.,"i can do like -20% power limit for maybe -4% max in benchmarks and nothing noticeable in game, while dropping temps like 6-10c as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can you give us more context?,like are you stress testing and its at 1.37?,what are your temps?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if your goals is to reduced peak power better decrease pl2 limit.,undervolting can make your system unstable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
okay and what did you change exactly?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no im only gaming.,i saw that my cpu was at almost 80â° and 1.37v.,i thought maybe i could lower the core voltage to lower the temps a little bit.,im using an asus 360 lc ii aio.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"na, only if you overdo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i followed this article by limiting max power for turbo boost power.,you can apply temporarily in xtu or permanently in bios.,https://www.club386.com/intel-core-i9-13900k-vs-amd-ryzen-9-7950x-at-125w-and-65w/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they are low in stock.,the i9 13900k is nearly outsold in every shop in germany for example.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"since the 13600k sells for 450-520euro here, i would say the 13400 will go for 300-350euro.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the pc new or used?,not normal.,not sure how to disable cores.,resetting the bios and reinstalling or maybe even repairing windows from a usb might fix it.,you can apparently disable cores in the bios and windows?,maybe an app can disable cores?,might be able to be caused by other issue?,no idea.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the number of cores in use can be set in the motherboard's bios, default is all cores active.","try resetting the cmos by removing the coin battery on it for a while and putting it back, then boot the pc again.","in windows, also check msconfig under boot, advanced options and uncheck the number of cores so it will boot with all cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the die it self is incredibly flat, but it's also thin and somewhat flexible so when it's soldered in place it will be under some tension/compression which bends it.",when you clamp the heat sink and put all that force it is going to bend in some different direction.,assuming you can cool the die it isn't a problem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"smear the heatsink with any paste, clamp it like it's intended and see the paste pressure distribution pattern, i bet it's close to perfect at \~90% of surface area.","simply dump liquid metal on it and that's it, no reason to worry.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is cool that you can see the distortion of light on the die.,yes there will be imperfections in the manufacturing process of these chips.,that said it does not matter much for the end user.,the larger improvements to thermals are the number of heat pipes and surface area for heat to dissipate from.,just make sure you put a ton of paste since laptops utilize direct die and do not have a large cooling surface.,limited options for upgrades to the cooling unit.,and the motherboard/cpu has been configured around these limitations anyhow.,"so even if you could beef up the cooling, gains are minimal due to bios.","that said, cooling in a laptop is always at the extreme end.",so you must ensure good amount of thermal paste.,and often they will have the paste overflow off to the sides.,"this way, when the paste heat cycles (heat up, cool down, repeat) there will be a wall of thermal paste surrounding the die that ensures paste does not pump out over time.",it is always why the screws stand off so far from the die.,they do not want to put excess force on the die.,"so when you repaste, just take care and do not apply finger forces to the heat sink ontop of the cpu/gpu die.","because when you take your fingers off, it can leave a gap.",only use the screws to apply the light pressure to the heatsink.,and ensure full die coverage.,you will get optimum performance this way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah my 10940x was really convex like in that picture, was only an issue for cooling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's an old cpu so lap it flat, it's not like you care about the warranty.","take a piece of a mirror or glass, tape some coarse sand paper to it, lap until flat.",finish of with something like 1000-1500 grit to smoothen out deeper scratches.,it doesn't have to be mirror finish aka shiny.,flatness is what matters.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sir, a 9980h is not old at all

3 years lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you have updated drivers?,"like intel management interface, chipset drivers and all that?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is the chip locked to 35 watts or something?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wrong bios settings.,with those scores the cpu maybe gets around 10-15 wattsâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's definitely heavily throttling for some reason.,"i'd try this:

1- go into windows power options, make sure it's not on ""power saver"".",2- factory reset the bios to defaults.,"if both of these don't solve your issue, fresh windows install from a bootable usb drive with a boot drive format ( whatever ssd or hard drive you install windows on ) then make sure all your motherboard and intel drivers are up to date.",that should solve it.,if it doesn't... it smells like a faulty cpu and i'd consider a rma at that point.,good luck.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you didnâ€™t show the necessary part of hwinfo that shows power limits, consumption and throttling reasons.",canâ€™t help until we see that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in hwinfo there is a tab that tells why the cpu is throttling, see what you find there",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i moved the ssd from my laptop to my 13700k build and was surprised that the windows 11 installation booted up fine.,the cores weren't boosting past 4.0ghz though.,a fresh install fixed it all up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
low clocks = low scores.,your pcores are being limited to 15x multiplier or around 1500 mhz.,check for the correct multioliers and set them accordingly in the bios.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did u by any chance not install a fresh copy of windows?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
power limit and or turbo is disabled in the bios if i see those max mhz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you can just say it's a 12700, the non k part is not important.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i assume several things are goin around.,"first, youâ€™re running your 12700 under power limit of 65 watts.","second, vrms on your mobo are thermal throttling, which occurs on some budget motherboards.","third, your cpu cooler is not properly installed.","fourth, for some reason turbo-boost is completely disabled.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all drivers are up to date,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>i didn't do a fresh install of windows 11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"none of those would cause what we see here, p-cores being limited to 1500mhz in single core workloads.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you need to do a fresh install of windows with a new motherboard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sure.,and e-cores arenâ€™t.,way more weird than i expected,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it is fixed already without reinstalling windows, see last post of me.",i think it was faulty processor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you running the in game benchmark for those numbers?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
welcome to the concept of cpu bottleneck,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you using the same processor?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes just the in game fps counter .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes 12700k .,all settings the same on game etc .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
post a picture of what you're asking about.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
has anyone been able to receive a master key from amazon?,their promotion site states that amazon does participate but amazon acts like they don't know what i'm talking about.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got mine yesterday too.,i had ref 002 account blocked error they cleared it after my 2nd email trying with pictures of master key email and receipt.,i'm really happy because i nearly gave up and bought it.,i would say it was really difficult but at least support is trying to help people.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have same issue do u think they will fix it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have the same issue,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if u contact them, 100 percent",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i keep contacting them , and they send me to  a form and i do it and never hear back",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i donâ€™t think it makes much of a difference.,maybe 100-200 mhz clock difference?,personally i would wait for the non k 13th gen models to come out.,might as well get the latest gen the socket will support.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you absolutely have to build now you can go with 12400 & msi's non-k overclocking b660 motherboard.,you can probably target 4.9ghz without needing more than an ak620 cooler.,as mentioned by others 13th gen will be good based on 13400 leaks and can probably even reach top tier performance if intel doesn't block non-k overclocking on msi's b660m mortar max.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my i7-12700kf is a beast, you can save money now too with your build and go 12th gen. then upgrade later to 13th gen because itâ€™s the same socket.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why not buy a 12400f and then pair it with msi mag 660m mortar max?,"once you oc this cpu, it matches even a 12600k as it has enough oc headroom compared to its big brothers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13600k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a i5 12600k.,i think the ones slotting under it would be a good buy also.,i canâ€™t see much reason to get an i7 personally because i have a 120hz tv i play on.,but my ultra wide is also only 175hz and even still not bottlenecking.,i fuel the best purchases are the best value purchases.,but do whatever you feel is in your budget and your needed.,either way a 12th gen intel you will be happy with.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
get 13th gen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i9 12900k  alll the way!!!,for video creation and gaming!,!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you think is it worth paying more for just a bit of performance difference?,or should i just stay with the 12500 for now then save up for the 13th gen later,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can i ask what are the drawbacks of f series chips?,i know that it lacks an igpu which is bad if the gpu malfunctions and needs troubleshooting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that would be nice but still over priced rn.,i would just like to build a pc right now so i am just choosing between the 2 right now.,planning to upgrade it soon to 13th gen tho,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks man!,"i will be going for the 12500, 12600 may seem like a great buy but i will just be saving the rest for the new chips.","although i am planning not to upgrade any sooner, hoping that it will last me for a couple of years to say the least",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are the 12th gens not worth buying?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel is probably 3-4 months away from releasing the non k 13th gen. if you must build now, get the 12400 with the idea youâ€™ll upgrade later but the 13600 should be worth the wait.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there are no drawback per say, the cpus are identical.",like you said the kf just comes with an integrated gpu.,so you are all good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you want best cheap pc then buy cheap b550 motherboard under $100 and as a cpu ryzen 5 5600 which is usually under $150 now and it's a performance equivalent to the i5 12500.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12500 is a good cpu.,"if it fits your budget, go for it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what are you using it for?,"if it's primarily for gaming, the 13600k is on par with the 12900k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
besides the 12400f none of the others are worth buying,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how much weaker will a 13600 non k will be against a 13600k ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the reason why i didn't choose the 12400 is that just in case i am not planning to upgrade anytime soon, l will still have a decent cpu with a decent igpu (just in case upgrading my gpu) .",so rn i am wondering if the 12500 or the 12600 is a better cpu to grab rn.,because prices wont drop anytime soon i believe.,the 12600k would be another great option but it will be already over the budget which is 80$ more than the 12500.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i am now currently thinking about getting a 12600kf pairing it up with a 6700 xt, but my main concern right now is when i will be debugging my gpu due to some reasons, i will lose the power to use my computer if that ever happens",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's finally done, choosing this cpu for my build.","it doesn't seem worth it getting the 12600 rn, due to the emergence of 13th gen cpus",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just mainly for light gaming on some fps games like csgo and valorant, for rendering (lumion, filmora, etc.)",and for cad.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"from what i can tell, the 13600 will have a slightly lower base clock and not able to overclock.",i believe the same p and e cores will exist.,what i like about the k skus is their higher base clock out of the gate.,iâ€™m not an overclocker but the guarantee they will clock higher is where you see the constant performance.,"honestly for gaming, you canâ€™t go wrong with 12th or 13th gen as the cpu is only a part of the system.",your gpu will make a difference too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in that case, go with the 12500. not a huge difference in speed and save the difference money wise.",it would be too tempting for me to get 12th gen when 13th gen options are coming soon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also the z690 motherboard is also expensive right now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
go 13600k for sure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but do base clock speeds even matter when running mce ?,"the plug n play default on most intel cpus isnt the base clock, just the boost clock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i used to have the i7-7700k and what i noticed when doing 100% workloads, eventually the boost would go away but it never went below the base clock.","so yes you can mess with some of the settings and depending on case airflow, cpu cooler etc, you should higher than base clocks but i like the guarantee of higher base clocks.",up to you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sounds like thermal throttling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it was rare but it did happen from time to time.,gaming wouldnâ€™t make as much of a difference since you arenâ€™t going 100% the whole time.,again non k skus are totally fine for gaming.,i donâ€™t hesitate to recommend them.,for this thread i was only saying to hold out for 13th gen given itâ€™s the last gen to be supported on the current socket.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got a 12400 rn.... i do want a 13600k but don't want to deal with the heat.,so maybe a 13600... jist gotta wait for reviews.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"thought i'd just make this post for people wondering if lga1700 cpus/socket would become permanently bent after long period of use because i was in the same boat and that made me hesitant on buying the frame

i've been using a 12600kf since its launch (got mine delivered on 4th nov 2021) under the stock ilm.",it's been a day over a year now (5th nov 2022) since i got it.,i had the thermalright bracket sitting in cupboard for about a month since i was worried about damaging the cpu and if it would even do anything after all this time.,built up the courage to install it today.,i tested with prime95 small ftt since that seemed to be the load that made the cpu pull higher wattage.,linpack and ycruncher would cap out at around 125w.,"before the frame, it would reach around 75-77c under the same load.",now settling at 68c with occasional spike to 70c.,"core-to-core deltas tightened aswell (also dropped idle from 34-36c to 28c, not that it matters)

i read on some threads that if your cooler has a convex coldplate the frame won't change anything, so i was concerned about that too.",i've got a deepcool ak620 wh which has a slightly convex coldplate but temperature still dropped.,this isn't meant to be a proper review or anything.,just something i wanted to share because it's something i wanted to know a couple months ago but couldn't find others in the same boat.,so if there are any of you who think it's too late to use the bracket: it's not!,!,[gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|slightly_smiling),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i put this frame the other day on my 12900kf and now getting 80â° in cinebench, with undervolt -0.11. before that i was getting 88â° (undervolt was -0.12).",cooler is noctua u12a.,"also changed the noctua paste with kryonaut, not sure how much that helped with the 8 degrees.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"awesome, i have a ak620 too and my contact frame is in the mail

i'm looking forward to mount it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i might need to reinstall mine as it made no difference for me.,could also be my cooler installation (corsair h150i capillex),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i changed mine yesterday from stock ilm to this.,"my cinebench 5 min run still thermal caps me at 100*c :(

stock ilm hit 98*c

so this actually hurts my temps now.",only 2*c but still.,"i also have all enforce all power limits enabled so package draw is only 247 :(

any advice?",i even applied thermal paste mx5 manually with a spreader to ensure full.coverage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is this a 12th gen only or for the new ones as well?,temps diff sound great!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is it true that the worst thing that can happen from over tightening is your pc wont boot or some odd memory issues?,there is no permanent damage as long as you are not going overboard?,i was planning to install mine but having second thoughts as this is the first time iâ€™m reading about the potential of bent pins.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm curious to see if intel made any socket changes for z790 to fix this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you by any chance run the same fan/pump speeds before and after the upgrade?,i get the feeling that those who keep saying it didn't make a difference aren't paying attention to their fan speeds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so basically i should buy one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you would have gotten the same results with just a repaste without the frame,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how did you tighten the screws ?,did you follow what gamers nexus did ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
h150i is convex cold plate so gains will be minimal.,igorâ€™s lab actually used that aio as a test subject to compare flax vs convex cold plate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"either the mount is garbage, the cooler is broken, or your motherboard is overvolting the cpu.",post of a pic of the cpu+paste with the cooler off and a hwinfo64 screenshot with package power and vcore visible and people can tell you what's busted.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not sure how big of difference it'll make for 13th gen but it'll fit on the exact same way.,might be better to wait for some testing online before doing it yourself just to see if it's worthwhile,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this thermalright one makes contact with the motherboard pcb so it's hard to over tighten.,follow gamers nexus' guide and you'll be fine.,it's almost foolproof because once you hit a hard resistance you don't tighten anymore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
kept all fan curves exactly the same.,using an air cooler so pump speed isn't a factor.,the fans actually spun slower because the temp reduced after installing the frame,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i repasted my aio after flipping my evo case about 2 months ago, made no difference, i put this frame on, 8-10c drop under load.",12700k.,quite a few posts on this sub alone confirm this definitely works.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i repasted 3-4 months ago when i got the new cooler.,"temps didn't change dramatically, if at all, like this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why would that matter?,the cpu is still held down by the bracket so yanking a stuck on heat sink ainâ€™t gonna pull the cpu off.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah followed the gamersnexus guide and the der8auer guide where you only use thumb and index to tighten.,do each screw with like 1/4 or even a 1/8 turn.,don't rush.,go in an x pattern.,and when you hit the resistance wall don't push further.,the cooler provides any additional pressure needed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
where do we check other coolers to determine if they're flat or convex like the arctic liquid freezers ii?,mine looks pretty flat but if it's nanometers i'm sure the nakd eye can't tell.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
could that be what causes my poor thermals in cinebench?,even with an undervolt it nearly hits 100c after a few seconds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks for the info, tried to find some more material on the matter but gen 13 is probably to new 
will wait before killing my new cpu :d",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it shouldnâ€™t i have a 12700k with a h150i as well.,my cinebench scores stock never exceed 80 degrees.,overclocked 5.0/4.0 all core are in the 85 degree territory.,"this is without the plate, i bought the plate but havenâ€™t installed it yet.",check case airflow (remove side panel) and cooler mounting pressure.,i also run the pump on extreme in icue.,edit: also check cpu vcore.,some moboâ€™s may crank the voltage at stock vcore i havenâ€™t seen it go over 1.25. overclocked i was running 1.33 llc 4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it wouldn't be different to the normal ilm that still holds the cpu down using the same screws on the bracket,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i set the core to 1.22 as that's the lowest stable voltage.,"i'll check cooler mounting, how tight should the bolts be?",finger tight or slightly more?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a 12700kf iâ€™ve used for almost a year with a nhu12a and my temps are amazing.,2-3c delta between some cores at most.,"i bought the thermalright ilm mount but havenâ€™t used it, and iâ€™ll have a 13700k tomorrow so i doubt iâ€™ll even fool with it then unless my temps are bad.",the u12a seems to match the bend perfectly with these cpus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it can't pop out when latched down with the stock ilm either.,i don't understand what you think happens with the stock ilm when thermal paste makes a cooler get stuck,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
he's thinking of the older sockets with the pins on the cpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

150w.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the coolers apparently rated at 250w tdp.,i would definitely go less than 230w.,cooler might hit 100c at 230w.,160-200w?,for gaming see what games pull and what temperatures you are comfortable with.,can always adjust it in the future.,might not get much for the additional power draw/heat after a point.,"for productivity could just do power, time and temperature measurements and make a chart to find out where you are happy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40 ambient temperature is crazy hot.,youâ€™ll be better to do actual testing and figure out what your cooling / environment can sustain.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"again,

only you can decide if something is worth it.","to someone that's homeless with a intel core i9 1st generation laptop from 2008, even a 8th generation upgrade for $50 may not be ""worth it"".",there are tons of benchmarks available.,if you need the featureset of new hedt.,can always wait but those won't be cheap.,i think 10 series hedt are solid but power hogs.,you also need to find a reputable board to go with them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no clue lmao.,i dont he even knew much about it.,and we agreed on $420 lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for how much?ðÿ‘€,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
420 rn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it mostly represents the new intel logo which doesn't really feature the old circle anymore.,"the first batches of alder lake cpus actually still featured that one, and it seems they switched to the new one on processors that physically don't support avx512 anymore like the first ones kinda did.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is an extension of the vector base avx instruction set on x86 cpus.,"avx-512 (also called avx3) allows a cpu to process data as large as 512-bit with a single cpu instruction, instead of being limited to 128-bit with avx and 256-bit with avx2.",the benefit is to process large amount of data more efficiently as avx-512 requires less cpu cycles than avx and avx2 for the same amount of data being processed.,when an application supports it it runs very fast.,"both the cpu and the software needs to support avx-512 for it to be taken advantage of, just like any other instructions.",very few consumer applications support it which is why there's no need for it most of the time on consumer platforms.,"that instruction is mostly used/supported in the data center, scientific and high compute areas.",a cpu with avx-512 support has dedicated transistors on the silicon to support that instruction set.,"when it is disabled, those parts of the silicon are left unutilized.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

wow iâ€™m surprised you got someone interested in that price.,i have an early-run 12900k that has avx-512 and i canâ€™t sell it for $375.,considering the 13700k is $399-419 most people would probably go for that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol my guys like itâ€™s fake just uh send it to me for $20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
$480 for a 12900k is not worth it at all.,"heck, even $420 is pretty poor value.",13700k's are around $440 and are better in every single way,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how much is it?,i have a i5 12600k on its wayâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
never heard it being called avx3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"more accurately, microsoft is shit at programming and didn't make the windows scheduler aware of big/little cores with different isa's, so intel disabled it at first with firmware and in later revisions at the hardware level.",you can tell this was a change very late in the development cycle because it's still present in raptor lake.,e: why the downvotes?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"one way to tell is use the y-cruncher, option ""advanced options"" -> ""hardware features"".",it lists your current avx-512 support in the printout.,"if you have an early cpu the chance is you can get it working with no e-core enabled, usually 2021 batches.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it apoears to be enabled on my 12400f, what's a quick way to test it really works?",does rpcs3 support it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ha!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah im not selling it to him.,he gonna get the â€œreal dealâ€ from micro center lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we need the guillotine sharpened for idiots wasting time of honest sellers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is the answer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
magical number,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
really?ðÿ˜‚ i didnt know that.,"belive it or not i has a couple of people want for $400, but i thought it was low.",i dont really know much about cpuâ€™s.,might put price to $420 and see if it attracts more buyers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's reddit, that's why",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't know why you're getting downvoted.,"the performance cores as stated multiple times here, do fully support  the avx-512 instruction set while the efficiency cores do not and because ms failed to make a scheduler that can differentiate between both types of cores and spread the load accordingly, intel decided to disable avx-512 on hardware level in chips starting from around jan/feb 2022.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because avx512 has nothing to do with the scheduler of cores  or with big/little,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
r/wrongfuldownvote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rpcs3 should use avx-512 and you can see some performance gain from that.,"try y-cruncher, it's in the ""hardware features"", avx-512 is listed at the bottom of the printout.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol i hope that when he buys it.,it'll have that icon and he'll have a nice little realization to himself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they stopped selling the ""halo"" chips in like 2021... the box chips is all he'll find at microcenter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i also support the culling of 90% of craigslist/facebook ""buyers"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
\*cough\* \*cough\* what were we talking about?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s still a great cpu.,retailers are still trying to sell it for $450 but the 13700k is basically a better version of it for less.,i would take the $400,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well i just got a 13700k for $420 that outperforms a 12900ks so i'd say you were asking too much anyways.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's present on p cores, not on e cores.",windows still has a problem migrating tasks to e cores that need p cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it does because the cores donâ€™t have equivalent instruction sets.,"so in certain situations that could leverage avx512, it might be more efficient to engage a p core and schedule another task on an e core.","but it doesnâ€™t seem like the windows scheduler understands mismatched instruction sets

to be fair it is very complicated and makes scheduling much, much harder, so disabling avx is probably best for now, at least for consumer chips",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
will probably go back and demand to see the manager :p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that made me laugh so hard hahaha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

how about if you use ultra liquid metal or conductonaut liquid metal.,i would love to see those,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when you say standard power limits do you mean you left those limits unchanged in the asus bios?,"i use ai overclock, enable mce, allow the intel boosting, and also use the contact frame (though i never mounted the cpu with intelâ€™s ilm).",extended prime 95 at maximum stress settings will get my hottest 1 or 2 cores to 90c with 13900k pulling 343w.,thatâ€™s with 2340 of rad.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

id believe it if it was asus's fault.,i bought a strix z690e off hardware swap last week but it kept shutting down randomly in memory tests with 2 sets of 5600mhz ram ( gskill and corsair ).,so i was able to return it thanks to the seller but got a z790 tomahawk instead.,"i'll try that with the 6400mhz ddr5 kit i got a few days ago as well, running with a i7-13700k",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"circling back, looks like its an asus thing.",my z790 tomahawk and 13700k were able to post my 6400mhz trident z kit first try and lasted 1 cycle in testmem5 extreme config by anta777.,ill probably let it run 10 cycles overnight just because im very strict about stability but its good so far,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 13900 should run it no problem.,it has to be the bios settings or motherboard in my opinion.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am now trying msi z690 unify x. i never had issues with ram posting.,it just failed occt tests in the middle of it randomly with a freeze or bsod.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 it passed the 10 cycles overnight so looks like iâ€™m good.,hope that board works out for ya,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it worked with 6600 cl32 39 39 76 corsair vengeanceat xmp settings.,on msi unify x z690.,no way it would have worked on the asus board as even 6000 corsair vengeance was not fully stable.,"&#x200b;

it sounds like you are doing gradual upgrades to your machine.,so you gotta ask yourself if its worth buying a ddr4 motherboard now to potentially replace it with a ddr5 one later on.,getting into ddr5 right now is actually not a bad idea because ddr5 ram availability has never been better an prices are slowly going down.,"however, i would not recommend buying high-end ram right now.",from my research ddr5 5200 cl36 is roughly equal  to 3600 cl16 which is a good starting point to get into.,a year from now ddr5 will be the go to ram and thats when you can start thinking about a proper upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

double check that you plugged your monitor into your graphics card and not into your motherboard.,"if that wasn't the problem, additional troubleshooting steps you could try are updating drivers and windows, or comparing fps in other games to see if the difference in performance persists.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is something i haven't heard about before; is there a tool to measure that or?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you can either apply an offset on the core voltage (like -150mv) or set a static undervolt, with fixed manual frequency and voltage.","with the manual solution you can go lower because you can choose to stay at a lower frequency, while with the offset you keep the stock frequency behaviour so you can't go too far down with the voltage.",also with the offset you might encounter clock stretching (seemingly stable cpu that in reality underclocks to avoid crashing and it loses performance).,for the testing i suggest prime95 small ffts since it should be the fastest at catching errors.,"chose a starting point, test for 5 minutes, then drop 10mv until unstable when you reach the limit test for a longer time, and also try different tests like linpack or ycruncher.",some people test for hours and hours but i'm satisfied with 1h prime95 + 1h linpack (this also stresses ram).,maybe throw a bit of ycruncher too since it appears to crash with seemingly stable settings.,if you encounter any stability issue afterwards just give it 10mv more and you should be ok.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, thatâ€™s too much cpu.",the nh-p1 can barely handle 65 watts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thereâ€™s really no chance youâ€™re going to cool a full powered 13600k passively, and i think any undervolting (while beneficial) will be negligible at the frequencies your cpu will be forced to run at.","remember, noctua gives the p1 a cooling rating of 42. the d15 scores 183. the very under-capacity l12s even scores 88. so youâ€™re going to run hot.",i strongly suspect the only way youâ€™re going to tame that cpu is with some severe power limiting.,like 65 watts or even less.,you might even be looking at t model levels of 35 watts (t cpus are sold for this purpose).,"you should be able to tweak your power limits to match whatever your cooling can handle, but throttling will probably be a way of life.","being mostly passive, you will want to keep an eye on that though, since itâ€™s possible it could legitimately overheat if you let it run too fast for too long, even with throttling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"negative offset 50mv, test stability with y-cruncher, 6 hours will do the trick.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you might be able to set power limits or temperature targets in the bios vs undervolting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
were you able to successfully undervolt?,i have the same motherboard with a 13900k but reducing the voltage by any amount in the bios seems to degrade performance severely which doesn't seem to be the expected behaviour.,i would have expected performance improvements in thermally limited scenarios.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i donâ€™t want to have thermal issues with y-cruncher or prime95, because iâ€™m kind of affraid about the capacity of the nh-p1",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the problem with using these very heavy stability tests is that they might not reach the upper end of voltage frequency curve very often.,especially with strict power limit the passive cooler requires.,you might be stable at prime95 but then some single thread load gets 300mhz faster and you no longer are.,this isnâ€™t a problem with locked frequency of course.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
semi-passively !,"and now, i'm not a big fan of the cooler due to its dimensions ...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that will take u 10 years to get a proper undervolt.,"u start at -100 and go add -10 until its obviously unstable and crashes, then pull back 10-20mv and run a long duration stress test.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i swapped the cooler for a noctua c14s (better in every possible ways) so i didnâ€™t have to undervolt my cpu anymore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
u can try a quick -100mv offset with a 65w power limit and see how it goes.,"play a few games, run cinebench a couple of times and see if it has any stability problems then tune the undervolt and power limit from there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you should always start with setting the power limits according to the cooler.,i think you should be able to get away with 80w pl1 and 120w pl2.,with perhaps a 20s tau.,maybe.,do your own testing with temperatures.,when those are set you donâ€™t need to worry about the temperature and you can focus on if undervolting gains performance or not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"very slow moving, silent fans on a tower cooler would cool much more efficiently than a passive cooler, even with â€œadjacentâ€ case fans.","with that said, 13th gen should be extremely efficient at low power levels, so you should get the most performance possible for whatever thermals you can actually handle.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh alright, thanks",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"pairing it with a slim noctua nf-a12x15 fan is actually a pretty good way to go for this scenario, especially if they use a curve which leaves it at 0rpm until *just* under the cpu throttle point.","that will allow it to remain passive under light or lightly mixed thread loads, but when it ramps up for an all-core task and hits, say, \~90â°c, the fan will kick in.","with how hot the 13600k will run (by design) at full tilt, what will happen is it will still hit the tjmax temperature, but having the now-active fan's airflow will allow it to boost slightly higher while throttling than it would otherwise.","it'll still throttle, just less so - more area under the performance curve, as it were.","setting the fan to kick in at a very high temperature also ensures that it only turns on when under heavy, extended loads, and not during typical desktop usage or while gaming.","as long as it's in a highly breathable case (or has the assistance of some ambient airflow or slow case fans, as you say) it's actually quite a viable solution.","a 65w pl should work just fine for fully passive, with a \~100-120w pl for hybrid fan mode, for an assist at the top end.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i would say just get the thermalright, it was tested by gamers nexus and proven to be good.",itâ€™s only like $15 on amazon and you are gonna save what with the knockoffs?,10 bucks or less?,if you want to save money the thermalright is $8 on ali express but you are going to wait for it to ship from china.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i will just say either get the thermal grizzly or thermalright contact.,gamers nexus did a full video breakdown of both and concluded that thermalright actually had better thermals than the thermal grizzly but is considered margin of error since they are so close.,also the thermalright has less of a chance to cause instability due to the plate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think some of the off brands use rubber/plastic washer/inserts around/in the screw holes vs having a solid plastic band across the bottom.,not sure if this is good or bad or a mixed bag.,the thermalright ones have a solid plastic layer on the bottom which is the same as the solid plastic layer on the bottom of the ilm that gets removed.,if you over tighten it the mainboard can stop working.,loosening the screws a small bit can make the mainboard work again.,pretty sure you can wreck stuff.,the thermal grizzly one doesn't contact the mainboard where the screws go in unlike the other ones.,it leaves a small space.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to be clear, the contact frames are only going to help if there is bending or warping on the motherboard.",that's why it's a ymmv type of thing.,it will also help prevent such issues if they would have occurred without the frame.,i think for the $15 it's worth it just to keep everything in tip-top shape but don't expect anything crazy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

does this include bestbuy?,bought a 13900k and never got a master key.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bought a 13700k from newegg but i hate call of duty.,good luck to y'all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh snap.,was the seller amazon?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hey could you share a link to product you purchased and how you asked amazon support for a key?,i chatted with support and they had no idea and told me to contact manufacturer (intel) :(?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is a bundle offer for it : https://game.intel.com/ww/deals-and-specials/next-gen-gaming,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"bestbuy is included, but good luck.","you'll need to call in, chat support is worthless.",i got a case opened and they sounded pretty confident about the promo and i was also told i'd be emailed in 2-3 days.,have little hope though...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
double checked and yeah amazon was the seller,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just any cpu sold directly by amazon you can check if amazon sold but checking other sellers in listing.,i just told them that intel lists amazon as a 13th gen cpu promotion participant and support went confirmed and said i should get the code soon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hmm ty for that

&#x200b;

i got my 13900 from microcenter, should i just contact them, i do not think i got a master key from them",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"same chat was pointless, told me contact our digital department at 1 (888) 237-8289 for further assistance.","&#x200b;

but when i get connected they don't know who the digital department is.",joke of bb.,"&#x200b;

posted on bb forums",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i contacted amazon and they are clueless.,also i tried to find an intel source that says they're giving mw2 with 13th gen and came up empty.,does it say that anywhere?,"i found intel sources saying they are giving it with i5s and another that says it's with 11th and 12th gen. regardless, let me know if you end up getting a key, please!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you might have just saved me 70 bucks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't think microcenter is part of that bundle offer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got the mw2 master code from the bb forums chat.,works!!!!,just send them your 13900k order details.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

amazon cs decided to backtrack pretends promo doesn't exist anymore buuut can't say i didn't see it coming",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
microcenter didnâ€™t advertise it for my intel arc a770 purchase but the code was on the receipt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's what i figured.,i don't think i'm going to get this game.,who will tell me how they fucked my mom now?,thank you for following up with me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you need to have the graphics card installed to redeem the code?,"looks like shipping will take a good week for me and if the code is emailed right away or receipt, wondering if you can activate right away.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
np can always try returning it and trying another retailer who would actually acknowledge the promo but kind of a hassle imo but to each their own,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no you donâ€™t, still had my 2070s installed when i redeemed it.",itâ€™s all done through the intel website which links it to battle.net and activision.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i waited so long while i fought bots trying to get my 4090. it's, bent btw, the graphics card.","looks like someone kicked it, but it's just cosmetic.",i don't want to send my cpu back.,i'm done waiting.,"i don't have much time to play, i want to make it count.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 okay thanks for your reply!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my guess is that itâ€™s something that will oc your chip to a relative performance close to the specified processor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just oc by changing the clock ratio.,46 would be 4.6ghz.,you may need to adjust voltages to get your desired frequency.,"i'd imagine this would be a somewhat more user friendly way of achieving the same, probably guaranteed by throwing more voltage at the problem than necessary.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just changed my 6700k to the 7700k 4.6 setting and its working.,i hear my 2nd cpu fan spinning up now which it rarely did before.,it would not post on the 5.0 setting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ohh that would make sense,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i see, the thing is i can't change the clock ratio for some reason, nothing happens when i click on it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i see, thanks for your input!",i tried the 4.6 and it's been stable so i've just been sitting on that for now instead of manually going higher.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
strange.,"use the keyboard arrows, enter, and numpad to set.","there probably wont be a dropdown menu, just a text edit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that worked actually, i can type numbers lmao thank you",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no worries, glad it all panned out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not much of a journey more like a trip,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is like a journey from ur room to the fridge lol i was expecting more,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm still rocking my 9900k, upgrading every gen never make sense to me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thats a pretty neat and expensive journey!,one day an i9 would be nice to have...!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you seeing much difference between the 12700k and the 13900k?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a very expensive journey ;)),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what gpu and resolution were you at during your transition from 12700k to 13900kf?,"assuming you are a gamer, did you notice any differences?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why did you upgrade after 1 gen?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
journey?,you barely went to the bathroom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i like the i9 9th gen box,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ah the 9900k.,i loved that one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i understand if you gotta upgrade your graphics card every generation but cpus?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice dice collection,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
almost the same as mine i was i7 9th gen. i'm on the i7 12th gen now.,ordered the i9.,how is it compared to 12th gen i7?,not that big of a difference huh?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
isnâ€™t the whole thing about the 13700k is its â€œas fast as a 12900k but cheaperâ€?,sidegrade over upgrade?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what are you doing with your previous cpus?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
still rocking the i5 4600k.,pc still smoother than the new laptops my friends get every couple of years.,goes to show what good care car do for any item,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"as someone with a 9900k, 9900ks, 10, 11, 12, and 13900k, your purchases are strange.","like the 9900k, really good cpu, then you basically downgraded, then you got a 13900k, what is the point?",do you want top of the line or not?,i don't really get it but nice pic nonetheless!,i'll post mine once i get the a770 in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my older 6700k and 1080ti are still at it for my wife's rig.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s not a journey.,whereâ€™s the 386?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and a short one at that with lots of cash wasted in the beginning and middle (due to the recent health upgrade) ðÿ¤¦â€â™‚ï¸,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
here with my 9700k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so true, if you run games @ 4k, it makes even less sense.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have 9600k.,13th gen seems to be a good time to upgrade now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
here with my i7 3770k does it make sense to upgrade now ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"same here, just seems like a waste of money.",i figured i'll wait until the next iteration of the pcie standard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"7700 here, finally waiting for 13900 coming",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"not sure yet, gonna make more tests tomorrow",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"with my 4090 probably,gonna do tests",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's the real question to be asked.,one of these likely won't need to be replaced for a good 10 years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you sell your old one its like a $100 upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

here with my 9900k with the rare dodecahedron box,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is man.,12th gen was a big difference in lows and over all feel.,pcie4 resize bar.,etc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes if you have the need, no if you donâ€™t.no one knows your situation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i5 12600k and 13600k are beasts tho,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in other words, not really.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i just did a 4090 13700 build after i read a review stating that you can oc an i7 to match an i9, but now i'm lamenting the 5 more fps that could have been.",i wish my stupid brain would stop picking apart my every decision.,enjoy your new setup.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i went from a 4700k to an i5 8th gen then to an i9 kf 9th gen but i knew the i5 was temporary (stock shortages.),i7 to i9 is an expensive jump.,ill be amd next in however many years.. not that they dont have their own share of spectre crap.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a lot of hassle though.,when i sold my 8th gen i5 there's all the worry the ebay buyer will be dodgy etc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"9900k would still work, no?",also at that point why not just get the 12900k and then not need to upgrade this gen?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"9th gen has resizable bar aswell lmao, even 8th gen does",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ðÿ˜‚,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea the i7 was out of stock and the kf is a bit cheaper than the k so i made the choice lol.,"read the i7 max out at 5.4ghz all core and now im at 5.6ghz and probabbly can go at 5.8,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i came from i79700k and although it was in the bios i never seen it do anything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
prices are insane.,they're trying to kill me.,i'm still overall happy with my system.,cyberpunk with ray tracing set to psycho is the only thing that gives it any kind of workout at all.,everything else just locks to my monitors refresh rate and doesn't let go.,it's nuts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i remember using excel to simulate tabletop role playing games back in the day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at least its capable of gaming unlike my 480p rocket league demon chromebook which runs at highs of up to 20fps!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not a gaming machine.,just because you can play minecraft doesn't mean it's a game machine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can it run emulators though?,thatâ€™s thousands of games it can play and it can probably run gamecube or even later systems.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"can run crysis and ff7 remake with low setting......plus ps2/3ds/ds/gamecube/psp/psvita and other emulator

great job for small nuc",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it could run some emulators but it's still not a real game machine.,my 8 year old cell phone can run emulators too it's not hard to do these days.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ur opinions r dumb asf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as linus said in one of the past wan show involving the intel arc guys (tom petersen and ryan shrout), the naming makes so much sense, and i think they did a good job of it.","the 3s, 5s, and 7s, are baked into intel as their signature nomenclature, and makes a lot of sense - even for the average consumer - to understand where that model might stand.",a3xx?,starter gpus.,a7xx?,the flagship dgpu offered by intel.,"then having alphabetical order for next generations of the arc gpus: (b)attlemage, (c)elestial, (d)ruid, and so forth - makes it predictable and easy to distinguish from gen to gen.

keep it up, intel!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think it has to be in stock to do that but i could be wrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" unless the 12600k is on sale, the 13600k is a better buy.","only downsides are that it needs more power, and runs hotter.","probably best to stick with ddr4 ram/mobo's, but that can give little more performance.","note: there will be sales, and it might be worth waiting for black friday sales later this month especially if you got a microcenter nearby.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 13600k performs around the same as a 12700k.,"so, obviously, the 12600k is slower.","the 13600k should only be $30 or so more than the 12600k, at least in terms of msrp, although 12th gen seems to be on discount right now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you're interested in overclocking, most 13600k can reach 5.4 ghz without much issue, possibly up to 6.0 if you get really lucky with binning and have strong cooling.","the 12600k will probably reach 5.0 ghz, with a really strong result being 5.4 ghz or so.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the $300 13600k in my cart already waiting for check out but found $150 used 12600k .,if 12600k below $200 then go for it else go for $300 13600k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

13th gen is the way to go.,"if you want an older gen, go back to 11th gen, as those cpus still had avx512.","if you see a deal on 11th gen, it may be one of the last chances to get wide simd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

totally depends on price.,the 13th gen is desirable for other reasons.,"but if the 12700k is less than a 13600k, or the 12600k is significantly less than the 13600k, they can be a good deal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i went ahead and just repasted, for this cpu i went with two pea sized dot of nt-h1 again on top and bottom (not fully on top/bottom but close to make sure it is covering the length).",may be bit excessive but\~ make sure i don't have to do this again if this was the issue and tightened each of the screws on cooler by doing 3 turns then switching to other side for equal pressure.,"&#x200b;

thanks for everyone who tried to help!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hi, thanks for helping out.",that would make a lot of sense.,"i'll ask for a replacement, then.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no joke there.,i got a phanteks 280 that is keeping it below 85 all day,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how many wattage noctua d15 can handle without  throttling?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hey!,thanks for the help!,"yup, i wouldn't have been able to mount it without it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

of course i did!,:),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not to beat a dead horse - did you try plugging the single cord into the cpu\_fan header?,"the entire aio is controlled via the cpu\_fan header....

either way, hope it works out - the lf ii 420mm is a monster, absolute silence and fantastic temps on my 5800x3d, you know, the chip that is known to be super easy to cool...lol sarcasm off.",good luck.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hey!,"thanks for helping out...

same results with the boxed cooler settings :(",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"please tell me how hot it gets when you run cinebench r23 multi-core for 10 minutes, after you change the setting.",i'm actually curious to know how my boy noctua u12a chromax black compares to your cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for helping!i'll try asap and let you know.,"problem is that msi bios is counterintuitive in its settings, at least for my experience.","i'm gonna need to study its features, first.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hey!,thanks for your answer!,"i'd like to point out a few things:

* it is running at 200w maximum, not 315,
* even after a while, temps won't go down unless i stop cinebench.",* neither the pump nor the tubes do make any kind of vibration or sound indicating moving fluids.,"as soon as my replacement arrives, i'll update this post :)!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks for helping

the lf ii 420 requires you to plug the single wire into the cpu\_fan header - pump and fans are controlled from there.,"in bios, select pvm and just start with standard profile - if you plug the sire into anywhere else it won't work.","you can split off the fan and pump, but pump goes into cpu\_fan header - that's it, you can split the fans and run them individually - but no need, mine keeps my 5800x3d at 21c idle.",just plug into cpu\_fan header and it's all done - dead silent and works like a dream.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

negative.,all cool there :(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have 420mm aio.,my old score was 29344 and now it is 30089.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can you tell if the pump is run and water is flowing?,what pwm header do you have the pump plugged into and whatâ€™s the pwm% itâ€™s at?,"the pump and fan speed will vary with that fan curve, i think the pump reaches 100% at 40/45% pwm",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did u set the pump speed to max in the bios?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
250.. i have my 13900k limited to 288w in bios and the nh-d15s is handling it fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"mine can only handle about 225-230w sustained, for peaky loads and stuff i'm sure it can handle 250 ish or more for short bursts but.",about 225 is where it it won't throttle and can sustain a 10 minute plus cinebench run on a 13700k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah okay, best of luck in finding the issue and i hope you get this problem resolved soon!",i myself am running a 360 version with the older bracket.,"just to check, the backplate you mounted was the one with a full(square) back plate instead of the smaller one right?",as mine came with 3 different back plates with 2 having the 1700 socket label.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's the aio man.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"done already, it was a broken pump.",thanks for helping!,:),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, you're not even reaching 200w after taking a second look, possibly an issue with your aio cooler pump.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your settings probably didn't apply.,i have msi motherboard and i9-12900kf.,i changed undervolt settings for 50 times before i read that you need to disable some security in bios - undervolt protection.,"when i turned that off, my settings applied.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
could you share what values you got?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no problem, if i can help just write me.","check the max watts running something like cinebench, if it is more than 253w then there is something wrong",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh i assumed from â€˜stock 13900kâ€™ we were talking any uncapped power limit.,"what a shame sorry to read that, best of luck with the next one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what app are you running to achieve these temps?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a lf 420mm and can sustain almost 280 watt forever.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is your vcore while running cinebench?,"1.4v is much, but that might just be a value when the cpu was idle.",in any case i would guess that you are pushing too much voltage to the cpu and that's just not coolable with normal means.,but in order to fix that you need to start your overclocks from the start and find out stable values that can keep you under the therman limits.,i personally have 1.3v during cinebench.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i donâ€™t think this will solve your problems.,you mention in your other comments you canâ€™t feel anything through the tubes and no vibration on the pump so iâ€™m leading towards a broken pump in the aio.,you sound like you know what youâ€™re doing so i assume you took the sticker off the cooler lol?,if you did then it sounds like your cooler is defected.,notice how your min temps at 26.5watts are 47c.,thatâ€™s not normal.,so leads me to believe there isnâ€™t any heat transfer taking place from cpu to radiator.,itâ€™s just boiling water in the aio.,try get a replacement aio and iâ€™m sure that will resolve the issue.,"also, just to confirm, when you have been remounting the cpu block, did it look like the mount was good?",as in the paste has been squished out to the edges across the whole cpu?,should look something like [this](https://www.ekwb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/08-1030x344.jpg),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12th & 13th gen is physically identical in terms of ilm.,just make sure you keep the ilm back plate on or you'll find yourself screwing into nothing and wondering why it won't work.,"here's some stujff you can do that should bring down the temps (if it's not a broken mount)

*cpu lite load down to 8 (should be 9 stock)

*long duration power limit 220w

*long duration maintained - 64s is fine, i would set to whatever the closest number to 100 you can put in

*short duration power limit 280w
 
*cpu core votage mode - offset mode

*cpu core voltage offset mode negative (-)

*cpu core votage offset (0.040) (remember, this is actually negative 0.040 because of the offset mode switch being to negative)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, same mounting solution.",i just used one on my 13600k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it will yes.,i'll link a review of the contact frame on raptor lake.,"the arctic freezer coolers are particularly flat, so they'd be more impacted by a bending correcting frame than other coolers.","can't say it'll completely solve your issues, but it can't hurt.",https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/thermalright-lga1700-bcf-contact-frame,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"pump header, fans are pushing a whole lot of air, if i place my hands on the tubes i can't feel any water, but i doubt that's helpful...

i tried touching with my fingers both the tubes and the pump, there are no vibrations of any sort.",but the small fan on the plate is spinning... how could i be more sure there is no fluid movement?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
even in multi core load (like cb r23 or rendering)?,what are the max temps in that scenario?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks for the help, i have mounted this one:

https://www.arctic.de/it/lga1700-mounting-kit-liquid-freezer-ii-series/mpsas00891a",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also not using the 1700 mount on my z790 board.,"surprising temps seem to be okay (28-33c idle and 55-70c in games), until heavy load like cinebench (some 2 - 3 p cores hit 100 instantly).",so just gonna chill till they send the kit to me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks again!,"i already did that, as the manual suggested :), if you take a look at my wattage is indeed always below 250w, precisely it is 200 watts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm running a memory test right now, i'll share a hwinfo screenshot with you once i'm done with the test.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"unfortunately the maximum reached is 200w, that's why it seems so strange... it's a 420mm aio blowing plenty of air from a giant case with a great airflow, top mounted with pretty standard case temps.",it must be the plate... wouldn't you agree?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hows the 13600k ?,what was your last cpu ?,i want this cpu for 1440p gaming.,"coming from a 12400, would you think its a boost worth buying ?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
by the fact you're hitting 100c in 5 seconds.,and also no vibrations from the pump is a give away.,make sure it's plugged in properly or try a new fan or pump header,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think arctic recommends using the cpu fan header and they have a guide for different mobo manufacturers for setting up the fan curve.,"https://support.arctic.de/en/pwm-settings

you could give it a shot before going through the trouble of sending it back",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
try the aio header.,usually aio header is not pwm and usually has full dc power all the time.,it will spin your fans and pump to max as soon as you turn on the machine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yep, cb23 is 95c peak core temp, but not throttling and maintaining 5.5ghz all p core.","it is in a fractal torrent, but remains pretty silent under load.","i'm not that bothered about temps, the longest heavy load i subject it to is video rendering for 5-10 mins and the gpu does most of that.",if i was actually running heavy all core loads i'd likely still go towards a large aio but for my purposes the nhd-15s is much quieter and meets the demands perfectly.,"the fan is off most of the time, it cools passively at idle/light workloads.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hmm yes, it is strange, do you have thermalright correction frame?",in my case it drops 10âº the temps.,"also i dont see on the picture the vcore that the motherboard is aplying, do you have it?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"seems a little high voltage there, now in outside home, but if you want when i return i can help you to adjust the voltage so the temps are better.",on stock with my kraken z73 it reaches 100 too.,"if i do undervolt it reachs 95. then i have done undervlock to 5,3ghz, no impact on gaming, neither on cinebench(i supose because of thermal throtling) and adjusted voltage and now never pass the 75âº",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
haven't done much gaming yet.,i came from a 10700k and i mostly play a game that's dependent on single core speed and the 13600k destroys it in that aspect.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hey, thanks for the help!","that was something i didn't realize, i was pretty sure it was suggested to connect it to the aio... even the plate has changed now on their website.","however, for sure i'll try it!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is the way....exactly how my 420mm is connected - cpu\_fan header,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"tried it, same story!",":(

it's probably just a defective aio.",thanks again!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for info man.,"i'm an air guy, so this was helpful.",ready to sacrifice a little bit of multi core performance just to run it on air.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"man, is this just a silicon lottery thing?",i can't even keep my 13700k from throttling at 5.4ghz in cinebench with a d15s.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intel 12400 gives me better fps than my old 9900k.,but by 10% - 15%... i sorta upgraded on accident cause it though i had a bad mobo.,"but the temps are nights and day, though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have a lf ii 420 - unless you're splitting the cables, plug the single cable into the cpu\_fan header - it's all controlled from there.",pump and fans are controlled from the one cable - just select pvm and standard in your bios and you should be fine.,cpu\_fan header and that's all you need.,"lf ii 420mm is ultra quiet, i'm sitting at 21c with my 5800x3d",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you pill the plastic of cpu cooler?,:) a lot of people forgot about it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, it scores ~39,000 in current configuration after a 10 minute loop in cbr23, vs 40,400 for this cpu under a 280mm aio and totally unlimited power.",quite happy with that.,single core and gaming performance is unaffected.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"contact frame/washer mod

careful cooler installation

a case with top tier airflow helps - my cooler sits in the draft of a 180mm fan and cools the cpu passively much of the time.",there's certainly variance in how motherboards handle power delivery/voltage regulation and that can impact temps.,"i think this is the bulk of variation seen- just setting a slightly more conservative power limit helps a bunch, and undervolting even more - although i haven't had time to go through that process with the i9 yet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"check with hwmonitor the motherboard data, and if you can upload a picture(run cinebench so it maxs) please",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"some tricks to the bios flashback that have worked twice for me in 2 boards in the last few days:

usb 2.0 drive, 32gb or smaller, fat 32 format in smallest file size allowable.","place the zipped downloaded bios on the flash drive, and unzip the file from asus on the flash drive, not your main drive.",rename the bios file with the .exe renamer.,move the bios file to the root of the flash drive and delete all other files/folders on that drive.,some of these steps were hidden on asusâ€™s deep support pages.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is asus specific i have no idea about other brands.,the renamer comes with the bios file.,"all it does is rename the file to the name specified in the directions, since the actual bios file is always named according to board and version number, but flashback looks for a specific and constant filename.","you donâ€™t need to use it, so long as you rename it yourself.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a part of the asus process,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it works with just the 24 pin connector,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
youâ€™re not actually turning the system on to do this.,itâ€™s all done while the system is â€œoffâ€ with just standby power.,so all you need is the 24-pin.,none of the other cables would have any power going through them anyways.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

in most of the reviews iâ€™ve seen the 13900k doesnâ€™t even go above 130w while gaming so if all you do is play games then even a good dual tower air cooler will do fine and you donâ€™t even need to set any power limits.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what are r23 single and multi core results on 200w and 125w limit using hi-end air cooler?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean if you put intel default power limits (i think its 253w?),you wont need to worry about running cinebench or high end benchmarks at crazy temps.,i've seen alot of threads about these cpus hitting 95c+ when benching them and the usual fix is to use intel power limits.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what!!!,mine can hit 150-180 watts in games if limits are removed and even up to 140 with limits.,the thing is an animal and runs hot!,even with a corsair block it thermal throttled like crazy with no limits and throttled with limits under very heavy load.,i'm hoping the bykski block does a little better because it's a little bigger and heavier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the stock cooler will give you bare bones/minimal cooling, so yes i would think 70c-80c while gaming is probably expected.",a modest aftermarket cooler would help things significantly.,"the cooler master hyper 212 evo v2 is a cheap and decent solution, around $40 us on amazon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep those temps are the stock cooler experience.,you can do two options to help 1 buy a 20-40 dollar air tower cooler 2 apply an undervolt of -0.050v-0.100v.,or do both together.,running at 80c won't hurt anything though so it's perfectly fine the hard throttling doesn't kick in till it starts hitting 100c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a noctua nh-l9x65 on my i5-11500 in a n200 miniitx case and the temps during r23 gets up to 72 c. 80 c isnâ€™t the end of the world but any aftermarket cooler is going to bring it down by at least 5 c which would be ideal.,at least help bring down fan noise/sound levels.,depends on your air flow in the case too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

has nothing to do with his problem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i know and frankly i don't care about his problem.,obviously my question wasn't revolving around that.,i want to know why he bought a 4090 when he already had a 3090 ti to begin with.,if he's running a monitor that doesn't benefit his purchase then i want to know why he upgraded....i want to explore his logic behind that decision.,"edit: to add to this, i have a 3090 and bought a msi 4090 gaming trio too.",after installing my 4090 with my new 13700k build i started asking myself if it was worth the money knowing what applications and games i was running with what type of monitor i use.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

nope.,"i am getting 40500 points without contact frame, (h150i elite capellix, unlimited power, max temp 94c) 

i'm pretty sure that contact frame isnt necessary for every case.",(msi z690 edge wifi ddr4),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can someone explain contact frames for me?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
imagine having to buy crutches for your cpu..... lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it really depends on the motherboard.,most didnt change the ilm and can benefit from contact frame.,if your getting over 90c on 253w on 10 minute throttle test in cinebench then your mounting is off on a 360 rad.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
youâ€™re probably super strong and handsome too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"corrects intel's shit geometry tolerances of ihs surface, eliminating most of concavity by applying equal pressure along entire ihs edge.","also replaces unsuitable mounting mechanism, that causes warping and strengthening ihs concavity due to two points of pressure.","it would not be a problem, if intel didn't skimp the living penny out of their ihs manufacturing process, similarily to when they replaced solder with goo.","ihs' were always random in geometry, but their size and overall power draw made this issue negligible, except for hedt cpus, with jayztwocents lapping video as an example.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yours walks just fine?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
though is it necessary as the op states on 13th gen?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're asking the wrong question.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it made zero difference in temps for me on 12900k.,iâ€™m using the ek water block older mounting holes on asus z690 mobo so not sure if thatâ€™s why.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the ek mounting system is very well made for applying pressure.,it has a 3mm solid metal (steel?),backplate and four spring loaded posts that will screw in until you destroy your fingers or your cpu.,"either way if you use enough pressure, the ihs gets flattened out against the heatsink.",lga1200 retrofit kits usually just provide 1mm lower spacers without changing out anything else.,"that means with the increased mounting pressure, their backplate bends, the retaining bracket bends, and you don't get the full pressure needed on lga1700 ihs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

heh.,no idea on any of that.,"i have to say iâ€™m not impressed with them â€œproving that it worksâ€ by showcasing screenshots of it functional on a freaking z790 apex, a motherboard that isnâ€™t even announced yet, and likely among the top 3 motherboards of all time for memory speed performance.",itâ€™s like proving your cpu goes really fast with liquid nitrogen cooling.,"yeah, butâ€¦ what about everyday users?",it would have been far more impressive to see it working on a bottom-of-the-line gigabyte or asrock.,"with that said, iâ€™m in the market for a fast 2x32 kit, so iâ€™m keeping an eye on it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iccmax 307a doesn't mean the limit is 307a sustained long duration at the package.,it'll throttle on microsecond-level transients.,asus default is 368a and even then it still iccmax throttles at 250w to 5.3-5.4 ghz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there's really no dangerous temperature, in the sense that the cpu will throttle before it damages itself.","so even if your cooling was inadequate, you'd just take a performance hit.",intel lists the maximum die temperature as 100c on their [specs page](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/212279/intel-core-i711700-processor-16m-cache-up-to-4-90-ghz/specifications.html) and you're well below that.,"obviously you can install more cooling if you want, but nowadays, 80c isn't that uncommon when stressing the cpu.",laptop cpu's in particular will regularly hit 95-100c under load.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

okay thank you!!,so maybe by the time i'm around 90c i should probably start worrying about fixing up my cooling then?,"i try to run most games with 144hz in mind, so the more cpu intensive ones start cooking a bit more, and it just worried me a little and i tried to do some research on it, but a lot of posts use acronyms that i'm not familiar with, or are just on a per-person's specs issue that it was pretty inconclusive for me.",edit: forgot to mention that i've been capping my frames in most games around 100 since noticing the temps but if i'm good to lock it back to my refresh rate then i'll probably do that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i wouldn't worry too much about it, but yeah, keep an eye on the temps and if it starts getting into the 90's you can think about what you want to do about it.",even adding a case fan or two can make a big difference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for what its worth, i have done a quick dusting - not a thorough one mind you, but i haven't checked thermal paste either, so a full cleaning could do me a good bit of help, and if it comes to it, i'll look for other cooling options if that doesn't solve it completely, but again, thank you so much!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

don't tell me asus' z790 is same rng as z690 in terms of ram overclockability xd.,oh man.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, it's... more expensive for sure, hardly available, 4 of sata ports are in absolutely atrocious placement (msi, wtf), for d4 version there's not really a reason to get z790 one (people can get well over 4200 mhz on z690, so you're entirely limited by memory controller clock capabilities), for ddr5 one i can't really find users reports, qvl states it can handle 7200 mhz just fine, z690 needs intel management engine update and newer bioses are sometimes awkward in terms of ram overclockability.","in usability terms, a and p versions are identical, minus craps like audio or connectivity.","there's somehow a big amount of people that just straight out buy 2x more expensive z790 boards and barely anyone with a ""reasonably"" priced boards give an insight.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hmm msi unify x for me.,but something might be up with asus bios because most z790s should be able to handle 7200 across two slots.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i would think it would be better and it should be, but i had issues with z790-f strix running ram with full stability at xmp settings even with core i9 13900k downclocked to 5ghz all core.",where it works flawlessly with spd defaults so cpu stability is fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because thereâ€™s no difference in the price in my country and i was not sure which is the better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
even with 4 slots as long as only 2 matching dimms are used?,?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
donâ€™t return the board its an ongoing issue with 13th gen that mobos canâ€™t run over 4000mhz.,i tried two z790 hero mobos and they both couldnâ€™t boot into windows with ram over 4000mhz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
z790-a>z790-p=z690-a.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also you need to put them in the rights slots.,they need to be in matching channels.,bit if that doesnâ€™t work then idk maybe a bad motherboard.,i read on a memory forum some people were overcoming a die to 9000 mhz on evga dark kingpin.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i have the z790 e gaming ddr5 with a 13900k, should i bother with the contact frame?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38k is standard for 250w power limit.,"the ratio is default, so yeah ""sync all cores 55"", 2x best cores go 58x",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's what i did to my 9900k.some cores can go to 5gz but i just forced all  core ratio to 47 instead because i saw no point in having 2 cores going to 5ghz while the rest where at 4.7ghz.seemed logical since i wanted constant stable performance to have all cores fixed at 1 core ratio.,my reasoning was why let a couple of cores go higher in certain singular tasks when im mostly gaming and the cpu goes to 4.7ghz all cores anyway.,comment you said to another user.,"""higher vid -> less available current under a strict power limit -> less performance.""",turns out it was a good idea unbeknownst to me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"there is a very good [video about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysb25vsnbqi)

tl;dr from thermal-grizzly web:

**the standard integrated loading mechanism (ilm) has contact points that are in the middle of the elongated cpu.",the surface of the integrated heatspreader (ihs) curves concavely due to the resulting uneven contact pressure of the processor in the socket.,"as a result, the base plate of the cpu cooler rests primarily on the edges of the ihs, so that the thermal ""hotspot"" in the center of the cpu is not optimally covered.","**_x000d_  
_x000d_  
**the intel 12th gen cpu contact frame has a special inner contour to shift the contact pressure from the center of the cpu to the edges during assembly.",this avoids the concave curvature of the ihs.,this means that the cpu cooler rests better on the processor and a larger contact surface is created to dissipate the waste heat of the cpu.,**,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you're probably right.,i've been given some laptops that more than likely had an intel chip.,this is my first purchase 100%.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel network chip probably,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"aww, that's the way it goes.",i walked in the door with mine and my s/o told me we had to run an errand.,so i sat it down and we left.,yours is worse.,hope it's a blast.,i think 13th gen is where i'll end up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
from the way people talk the hardware is great at this price.,the software is what needs work but has seen improvements.,i hope that continues.,luckily this is not my main gpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no clue.,"when i get it built, i'll probably look at new releases to see if anything strikes my fancy.",any suggestions?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah says it at the bottom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm on a 3080. i got this just for fun.,looking forward to making a decent sff machine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think you can claim the new mw2 depending on where you bought your gpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice!,and it's the 16 gb version too i presume?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ah nice!,where did you get it?,"i've been looking at trying to get an a770 but can't find one anywhere

my ""local"" microcenter has them but not going all that way just for that, if there was one closer i would",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what's especially amusing is there are also a number of people looking for realtek nics specifically so they can avoid intel's i225-v.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the 13900k can run quite hot.,especially with the stock locking mechanism bending the ihs.,"if you're going to run all-core workloads on that 13900k, your best bet is to get a good aio like the arctic liquid freezer ii 280mm, and a contact frame for the socket to prevent the ihs from bending.",psu should be more than adequate.,a tip for lowering 13900k temperatures is to go into bios and set cpu p-core all-core ratio to 55x.,"this prevents the cpu from requesting the necessary voltage for 5800 mhz single core boost, and makes a huge impact on temperatures.",do you have an older cpu to update the bios on that motherboard?,"it might come with a new enough bios, and it might not.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
get a 360mm aio,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you would need an additional 8-pin eps peer connector only when your cpu is using more than 336 watt.,you should be good in that department.,although -while it is not required- you might want to upgrade the psu to get some headroom in your power budget.,did you look up any hardware comparisons between the i7-13700k and the i9-13900k in your workloads?,i don't really know whether there is a worthwhile performance difference between these two processors in your use case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1) i wasn't able to go straight to the latest bios.","i had to do in place upgrades to the version listed on the cpu compatibility page, and then on to the very latest version.","2) when the above, after pressing the button the led and usb drive flashed for a few seconds, then the led went solid and no activity on the pen drive.","this was trying to go straight to latest and a solid led (and no activity on drive) means nothing's happening, so after a few mins you're safe to turn off.",should if you need anything mate!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this could be something which happened with 10th/11th gen too.,the prices went up shortly after launch (because of demand?),and came down a month or two later.,or could be intel is revising the prices because of the usd <-> inr exchange rate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
indian prices are often unstable but i feel like 13th gen is in general more expensive than it should be.,they also haven't discounted any of the 12th gen parts yet.,i assume all the positive coverage and the lack of meaningful competition from amd has gone to their head again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

recently bought the a750 at my local microcenter for msrp (shocking right?,"lol)

i'm actually pretty happy with it.",it plays all my games and all my work needs.,i do see the occasional stutter and issue here and there but i'm sure this will all be worked out with future drivers.,for the price.,you can't go wrong for 1440p gaming.,and i got a free game!,"mw2 ðÿ’ªðÿ»

proud early adopter ðÿ‘

edit...

so far the games iâ€™ve played.",**modern warfare 2**\- multiplayer performance is great and smooth.,especially with having the ability to mess with xess.,hard to say if some of the stuttering is gpu related or new game release that still needs some tweaks.,regardless i didnâ€™t feel like it hindered my ability to have fun.,i messed with competitive settings and eye candy settings.,competitive without a doubt is smoother.,but eye candy with xess is impressive.,iâ€™m going to try out campaign/co-op soon as itâ€™s a slower play style and youâ€™re more aware of the â€˜*little things*â€™.,**battlefield 2042** \- definitely needs to be optimized.,there are artifacts.,some graphics donâ€™t load properly.,lighting is horrible... my laser sight literally looked like a light saber and blinded the whole screen.,overall performance isnâ€™t great.,even with competitive settings it wasnâ€™t great.,"(*i know the game isnâ€™t great in terms of game optimization, iâ€™ve played with other graphics cards so i know what to expect at its best and worst*).",i donâ€™t recommend this game at the moment until drivers are better optimized or the game is optimized for the gpu.,(*some games perform better with amd or nvidia.,"so it potentially could be an issue for intel*)

**planetside 2 -** (dx11 title.",originally was a dx9 title overhauled to dx11).,"for this title it actually performed better than expected, for an older title.",this game is cpu heavy but does like a good gpu paired with it.,higher resolutions provided better performance and i was able to load shadows with little impact.,before it would tank performance in big battles.,i need to test this more as iâ€™m really surprised by the results.,**halo infinite** \- the game plays well with medium to low settings at 70ish average.,however optimization is needed.,it would stutter and some lighting was a little off.,turning everything to low helps with smoothness but iâ€™m a sucker for eye candy.,comparing it with my previous graphics cards i would consider it under performing and itâ€™s something that could be fixed with future drivers.,**medal of honor allied assault** (dx8 title) - this game is old but i love it.,no impact on performance due to older api.,maxes out fps and no artifacts.,graphics appear to load just fine.,**titanfall 2** \- (dx11 title) probably one of the best optimized games iâ€™ve played.,no issues with a750.,maxes out frames on maxed out settings with no stuttering or artifacts (at the moment),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i would consider this card as a replacement for my son's rx480, but for whatever reason it doesn't perform anywhere near as well at 1080p as it does at 1440p, relatively of course.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what a beautiful card,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the rgbs are included with the a750?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
finally the dream of having amd cpu with intel gpu.,and op missing motherboard backplate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what would this be on par with performance wise from nvidia?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice!,i'm still trying to get an a770,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just managed to get an order in for a a770 less then an hour ago!,collectors item for me as i already have a 4090 lol... plus i might also get the xtx.. i might just have a crippling a gpu addiction lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is no backplate?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for your service.,hopefully this paves the way for a 3rd gpu provider to compete with red and green.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how much fps you getting in mw2 in ground wars/invasion mode?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what kind of case is that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"really nice, can't wait for intel going forward, this is why i am getting an a770 even though i have a 3080ti",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah in 1080p for some reason it doesnâ€™t perform well.,well might not be the correct word but like you said relatively speaking it doesnâ€™t perform as expected.,but the higher the resolution the better it gets.,kinda minds me of the vega dgpu series with higher resolutions it performed better.,for your kiddo i would definitely recommend something more reliable.,tried and true.,something i wouldnâ€™t want to mess with.,if you like to tinker i recommend this.,with future driver updates iâ€™m certain performance will improve.,iâ€™m hopeful when afterburner is able to read the bios we can fine tune and unlock what this gpu is capable of.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
some frame processing overhead.,there is some cost to drawing a frame that doesnâ€™t depend on resolution so more frames mean more of that cost.,on higher resolutions more of the processing time goes to actually drawing the pixels so this overhead is relatively less important.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it really is.,quality build for the price point.,this is the kind of card you want to show off and not keep closed up.,*starts looking for a new case*,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no not on the a750 model.,that is exclusive for the a770 limited edition 16gb model (correct me if iâ€™m wrong).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
right?,never thought iâ€™d see the day lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
due to the state of the drivers.,itâ€™s hard to give an accurate answer.,performance varies between a 3060-3070 depending on the title.,once drivers improve itâ€™ll be more clear.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sounds like an expensive addiction :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks dude!,i totally agree.,now imagine if evga released their version of this card ðÿ˜±,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what do you mean?,"there is no bare pcb visible, thus the card has a decorative backplate installed already.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

nice dude the arc series has a lot of potential.,they just gotta get their software/drivers to take advantage of the hardware.,iâ€™m looking forward to their next driver.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

oh ok,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i agree lol.,very expensive.,but to a point yes i do agree.,iâ€™m glad the a750 functions well enough for me to be happy.,itâ€™ll be a collectorâ€™s item in the event intel quits on the whole gpu thing lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

any artifacts with xess that you can perceive with your own naked eyes?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah it definitely does!,"a990 going to be insane

definitely need to get their drivers in order and soon they will be",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean i havenâ€™t had any issues with what i do.,but at the same time iâ€™m not sure how your experience would be.,to play it safe a 6600 would be golden for your son.,just plug and play.,the arc series might give him some unexpected experiences.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
resizable bar is a must.,based on their requirements itâ€™s needed to get the best performance.,"so far i haveâ€¦

itâ€™s totally justified with the free copy of cod right!?!?,right!?!,?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it would definitely help level the playing field.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i havenâ€™t seen anything that really stands out.,it does work for sure.,when i switch to xess performance it does help with fps average and i honestly couldnâ€™t tell the difference in texture quality.,keep in mind this is when playing fast paced multiplayer.,iâ€™ll check back when iâ€™m playing single player or coop when itâ€™s slower and you tend to pay more attention to the little things.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> modern warfare 2- multiplayer performance

/u/opterono3 have you tested xess in dmz/warzone 2 as well?",is it working?,if yes do you have some rough fps numbers to share off vs. on?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i keep telling myself that hahaha ðÿ¤£
itâ€™s a beautiful card though ðÿ¥²",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the numbers are relatively the same.,but it does take a slight dip when facing the haze area,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you get your copy of cod?,any clue how?,i assumed it would be a code inside the box but found nothing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
doesn't that mean xess is not working in warzone 2?,do you see a visual difference off vs on?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got mine from microcenter.,not sure if all stores are doing it but i got it via email,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it does work because with xess off the fps average around the 65fps range,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and what is it with xess enabled (e.g.,balanced) since you said numbers are roughly the same?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ultra quality present with shadows and lighting settings set to low/off.,"performance: 90-105fps

"oh they're powerful enough for 4k, just not hard games lol.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"apparently, according to hardware unboxed, they can do 4k because xess on arc is really good, with image quality better than fsr 2.0, close to dlss 2. plus rt is good, so it's not all bad.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
price to performance doesnâ€™t seem too bad.,so combined tinkering with new stuff and decent performance in most cases.,i would have considered one if they had launched earlier.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i don't have one, but if i was to get one it'd be, because the performance is pretty good for the price in the games it's optimized for, and as the drivers mature it will see constant improvement over time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2. it performs decently at 4k compared to other cards.",nobody is buying an arc card because it's the best gpu all around.,"everyone (hopefully) who's buying one knows that it's not imperfect, and i'm sure all of them are picking it because of curiosity/excitement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"that's odd, i got a 13900k and my 3080ti together, getting an a770 too for fun",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we'll get 'em next time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all great reason!,all depends on what computing you do.,i wish intel has an option for me i but i play a lot of vr and my 3080 12gb is only just enough and even with that in games like il2:bos and dcs i have to dial down settings to hit 11ms frame times (90fps),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this gpu can still benefit from a stronger cpu due to the driver overhead in some dx11 games.,aside from that the 13900k remains a strong chip for productivity applications.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably be for 1080p gaming would be my guess.,but even 1440p leaves gpu headroom in some games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes.,the cpu is the loss leader at micro center.,but you can't deny they had the best price on launch out of all the retailers.,also while we're on this subject anyone who lives near one and isn't a member yet.,there's a $25 off cpu deal for first time members that can be stacked with the $20 off motherboard bundle.,get on it if you plan to build a new system.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hopefully this isn't 2 confusing.,6 cores wasn't stable so i adjusted.,"his phrasing did too me as well, just saying.","lol

 llc 3 oc.",you have to map every core to balance it all.,"ecores min and max v for 44x-50x and pcores from 57, 58. skip 59 then 60, 61,62, and 63 if you have the overhead.","my top 4 cores until 85c are at 6.3ghz

i use a 1.54 vcore input and scale off it.",if i had one more throttle stage i could have 2 cores run 64 but i can't think of a way to stagger that in without a wild swing somewhere making random transient loads.,the key is not to have amperage drops happening all at once by staggering clock max with all the bin drop flags available.,at 85c and 8 cores engaged i drop one bin on the slowest 4 p cores.,the first four cores have a 64x max even tho they only have a 63x max on a per core basis.. that makes the 85c bin drop with 8 cores engaged only apply to the 4 slowest cores.,all the rest of the staggering starts at 89c and happens every 1c in pairs or single cores each level.,your slowly stopping the thermal run away and controlling transient loading .,"e cores are 1-4 @ 50 5-8 @49 and 10-16 pulling all ecores to 4.4ghz 


 its hard to set with the vdroop but manageable between the active core offsets having 2 offset per core based on heat and activity.","1.57 max to a 1.27 is alot of vdroop and transient potential

plus 2 heat offsets per by temp on a per core basis..  

by using the core utilization offsets and the per core offsets you have 4 stages of throttle so you don't ram into tjmax full tilt and can mitigate voltage swings

absolute bottom end performance is a throttle into 57 p core and 45 ecore as a indefinite sustain with the benefit of breaking 1000 points on single core in cpu-z.i kinda cheated with ddr4 4200 cl 15 gear 1 n2 with all tight timings  1.34 sa 1.6vdimm vcore scales from 1.56ish to 1.26-1.27 full load.",all the single punch i can muster while being able to pass whatever bs unrealistic thing i've tried.,which is only blend on prime and small fft occt for 8 hours.,ram was ran for 15 or so hrs large fft prime.,"plus memtest86 to dial it close with the bios

sub 40ns is nice for min frames, ty ddr4.",the 7900x sucked dick compared to the intel.,i wish i went all intel in hindsight.,kinda waiting for bios updates.,if you try a high vdroop configuration take it slow when you map your individual cores envelope be sure to drop every other cores bin by 2 from the core your testing..... then test a all core load so your vrm output is as saturated as much as possible.,that keeps other cores vcore request from messing with what the test core requests and invalidating your notes.,you must stagger your drop out for heat ramping when you get a full cpu load is the basics.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there's enough paste.,it's just not enough pressure.,with sufficient pressure you can stretch even a small drop of paste across the ihs.,"the paste barely moved past the center of the ihs, which means there was hardly enough pressure on it.",it's as if the cooler was just gently placed on top of it with nothing but gravity pushing it down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'm more interested in the 13500 this time around.,same core count as the 13600k and should be under 300$.,might not be the budget king but i think it will be worth it over the 13400f for the extra cores and integrated graphics.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they really widen the gap between the 13100 and 13400 unlike the 12100 and 12400.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is already confirm that is the same chi pand i've seen people complaining about it.,a 10 core cpu for less than 200 usd.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"basically it will be a paper launch, if they actually start shipping in q1.",their yields are below 50% right now.,they are going to be losing money on every chip they make.,they probably are under some contractual obligation to ship and would face serious financial penalties to some oem.,this is a way for them to avoid announcing another delay.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

iâ€™d disagree with this actually.,pat is an engineering person but he understands the importance of return on investment and hard stop deadlines in development cycles.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if you do plan on using windows 10 (even though its not recommended you do) i would disable your e cores so there's no scheduling error which will happen.,gaming should be fine when doing that.,but theres just no reason to not go windows 11 on these new chips.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've got a 13900k and tested both windows 10 & 11. couldn't find a difference when it comes to gaming performance.,decided to go with windows 10 because i'm more familiar with it.,the differences are marginal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you can use a program like process lasso to manually assign processes to cores.,"if you donâ€™t want to do that, from what iâ€™ve seen windows 10 is still okayish but youâ€™ll have slightly lower performance and higher power usage than windows 11. and other bugs and quirks potentially.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it should perform fine on either for gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it will be fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

nh d15 or u12a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for a 13600k?,any 240mm will be enough.,but the absolute best would probably be arctic freezer ii or corsair aio.,the only reason i dont recommend nzxt products is because cam is very shit.,some people dont like icue either but i never enocuntered a problem with it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have an alphacool eisbaer 360 on my 12900k.,"for an i5 it is overkill, i would get something a bit smaller.",what i like about alphacool is that their radiators are made from copper and not a copper/aluminium alloy like most aio's.,pure copper conducts heat a lot better.,also their aio's are expandable.,you can expand them to bigger loops if you want to in the future.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
custom loop,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for real though.,i stopped using aios after my last one decided to spring a leak and ruined my gpu / motherboard which were never replaced by the manufacturer.,it's only giant tower air coolers or maybe a custom loop one day if i feel like messing with one on my personal pc.,"the aesthetic of an aio is nice, but you can't beat the reliability of air cooling unless you're running passive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

nice joke.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

13600k is faster 8% on average over 12700k going by meta analysis.,you can undervolt and get 5% easily with 12700k.,"but you get 2 more p cores with 12700k, that could make a difference down the line if you plan to keep your pc for longer than 4 years.","~~i think we are already seeing benefit of more than 6 p cores.~~

~~kitguru review of 13600k wd legion ultra settings was 20% slower in 1% lows than 12700k.~~

~~hub sm-remastered ultra raytracing the 13600k was 10% slower in 1% lows.~~

~~in both scenarios 13700k was 15% faster in 1% lows over 12700k.","which would point to core differences limitation  over architecture differences (especially as 13gen was more cache and in other benchmarks was faster).~~

obviously this is on 1080p and 1440p at 4k there is no difference even vs zen 3.
  

if you game mainly, then what use are the faster cores, if you run out of them.",then you are forced to upgrade like you would run out of ram or vram on gpu.,you get stutter experience in certain cpu bottleneck scenarios.,but when you get them it ruins your experience.,"but it also depends on price if 12700k is same price as 13600k, get it.","but if it's a lot more, then that is pointless as that money is better spend on future platform upgrades (cost of mobo).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a 13600k is at least 25% more expensive where i live.,"i just bought a 12600k for 300â‚¬, and the 13600k can't be found anywhere for less than 395â‚¬.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nope.,it's 300 vs 340,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the pc shop i buy the mobo from takes care of the update, it's fine",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your not alone.,these new chips and even gpus i mainly prefer to undervolt them as stock boost clocks get so close to what you can get on reasonable cooling with an oc it's just not worth it as much anymore.,especially on these cpus that are bouncing into their thermal limit sometimes undervolting ends up with a free performance bump,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 13600k one of the few chips that worth ocing because some of the clock speed down-binning is artificial due to shutoff cores instead of silicon quality of the functional cores.,many of them should be able to do 5.5ghz p-core with 4.3+ e-core and 4.8+ ring.,13700k is a lot more likely to be a disqualified 13900k due to silicon quality and 13900k is already clocked to the moon with the best chips reserved for 13900ks so not much more oc room on those.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most of the people have always been leaving settings at stock and oc has always been a hobby.,these days there is less oc headroom though than there used to be as the manufacturing processes are better and thus there is less variation in silicon quality.,additionally the manufacturers have learned product segmentation to take the remaining quality differences into account and prebinning silicon.,the general outcome is that there is less to be gained.,having said all that.,"i have always oc:d my cpu, sometimes gpu and ram also.","when there is pretty free performance on the table (""free"" in meaning that i do not oc to the level where the power consumption really shoots up), why not take it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're right.,"i always oc'd my cpu's in the past, but i don't care anymore.",even bought a non k variant as my last cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
now cpus and gpus overclock on their own!,"if there is a thermal headroom they will continue to boost high, until it gets hot or power throttles, otherwise , yes overclocking is more of a hobby and benchmarking",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm not sure if you should be drawing that conclusion based on the data you are citing.,"in both cases the 13600k is also slower than the 12600k, which seems to indicate there is more going on in those results than just 6 p cores vs 8 p cores.","https://www.techspot.com/review/2555-intel-core-i5-13600k/

excellent information.,can i get your opinion on something?,i just got the $350 12700k/z690 combo deal at microcenter today.,"i'm building a dedicated gaming pc and a separate daily driver/htpc/nas/vm box, any recommendations on which to use the 12700k for and what cpu to buy for the other?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
since when does the 13600k get 2 more p cores over the 12700k?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> you can undervolt and get 5% easily with 12700k.,"once you're mixing overclocking into the picture, the 13600k will hit 5.3 ghz if it's a particularly poor bin, and 5.6 ghz if it's a good bin.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its a lot of cpu for 40$.,well worth it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"even more yes, in that case.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
actually a 13600k with a b660 board could be cheaper than a 12600k with a z board and it smokes it even without oc.,there is zero reason to go for a 12600k now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nope its â£340 vs â£260 :p

he's definitely not alone.,i'm pretty sure that the %'s of enthusiasts that oc nowadays is lower than it was 5+ years ago.,"for me, the extra noise, power/heat just give enough fps to be worth it.","i'd rather undervolt, and bring power/temps, and noise even lower.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,the 12600k hits 4.5 all core.,an easy oc gets 5.1ghz all core.,that is a worthwhile oc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ty!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep you used to be able to gain more on overclock years ago but overtime boost algorithms and binning have brought us to where overclocking is much less worthwhile,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you are absolutely correct, the only thing is that it worthwhile for benchmarks results, otherwise the in real life scenarios i highly doubt that it is worth itâ€¦older cpus were able to benefit from overclocking and it would actually results in a feel-able performance gainâ€¦the only thing to do in modern cpus if you are not overclocking as a hobby, is to remove power limits , otherwise intel and amd already squeezing all the performance out of their cpus and the only way to get more performance between generation is to improve the ipc and the cache as well as performance plus physical cores, and definitely frequency, so it have to be all combined to feel that the cpu is actually faster than last generation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks.,i got that deal but i could only buy one :(  so i still need to figure out a cpu for the second build iâ€™m doing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> 12700k has 8 p cores which has potential that could help down the line over 6 p cores.,that's not how it works.,"cpu limitations fall into two groups:

1. single thread performance limited
2. multi thread performance limited

in the case of #1, the 13600k has a significant advantage thanks to higher boost clocks.","in the case of #2, the 13600k still has an advantage thanks to more e-cores and higher clock speeds.","the only software that scales to a certain number of threads, and no further, are old and poorly written.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is exactly how it works.,"you even confirmed it, 12700k has potential to out last 13600k due to mt performance of p cores.",for example st performance of 13600k p cores according to cb23 is 2050 per core x 6 times = 12300 available performance of p cores.,st performance of 12700k is 1950 per core x 8 times = 15600 the sum performance of p cores.,"12700k has 25% more performance avilable to it from p cores, with uv it becomes 30%, as p performance jumps up to around same level as 13600k.","when a game will want to use more than sum  performance of 13600k p cores can provide, it will have to go to e cores.",while the 12700k will still have 25-30% resources available with its sum of p cores without having to go to e cores.,going to e cores incur a latency penalty (due to layout) and also e cores being less powerful.,that is why it's said that e cores are uslees for gaming.,"that is also why like with 4 old cores cpu get stutter in certain cpu limited scenarios, as you need more than 4 cores can provide or you get stutter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"raptor lake has fixed the e-core latency, there's no penalty when e-cores are in use.",> that is why it's said that e cores are uslees for gaming.,and you've been wrong since the release of alder lake.,"2p + 8e is better for games than 4p + 0e

> that is also why like with 4 old cores cpu get stutter in certain cpu limited scenarios, as you need more than 4 cores can provide.","multi-core isn't a goal, it's a means to an end.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are perfect case of 2 people watching same video and coming to different conclusions.,"i would guess you are refering to hub video
 https://youtu.be/wqb96bdsb4m

but i guess you skipped what steve said or just had lapse in memory, he was disaapointed with e cores, go to 11:20 min.",so even the host had different opinion than you.,"in many case 4 p cores were faster than 2 p 8 e cores too, so i don't know where you got the data from.","plus he was disappointed that *when 4 p cores of 12900k hit 100% utilization in hitman, adding 8 e cores did not help!","*

so there goes your *theory* that e cores help.",i rather have more p cores and have definite assurance (if needed) that they will be useful if such situation arises.,"especially like said that with small uv, you get same performance of 12700k (you can uv offset even on b660).",rather than have less of p cores for 8% performance and suffer consequences of having to upgrade sooner based on *speculation* that e cores may or not help.,video comparison of 13600k vs 12600k p cores vs e cores and disabling them.,in all situations running only on p cores were faster over p + e cores.,"https://youtu.be/fl1zydhjera


so yeah my evidence confirms further what i said.",i think we concluded the topic.,"if you still disagree, then just agree to disagree.",different philosophy.,"i will continue to recommend people 12700k over 13600k (at simlar price), if they plan to keep their system for longer time.",it's a valid choice from my perspective.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

a lot actually.,they're very popular outside the us.,the problem is every single account logged into counts as another pc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the high cost of am5 boards certainly didn't help either with the zen 4 platform cost.,"back in mid-2019, i bought an asrock b450m pro4 board for $75, and later upgraded the cpu to a ryzen 5600. zero problems with running pbo+co on it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"every platform is new and has the potential for issues so past experience doesnt relate to knowing the new platform wont have issues._x000d_  
_x000d_  
in past builds i have had:

z390 + 9900k (intel)  
x570 + 3900xt (amd)  
x570 + 5900x (amd)  
x570 + 5950x (amd)  
z590 + 11900kf (intel)  
z690 + 13900k (intel)_x000d_  
_x000d_  
every single one of these builds and platforms were just as fine as the other.",there really is no gamble going either direction.,just pick whatever fits your needs best for performance and features.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"pepperridge farm remembers the sandy bridge's sata 3 failures with their early chipset revision, where the only solution was to rma the board for a replacement: https://www.anandtech.com/show/4143/the-source-of-intels-cougar-point-sata-bug

and letâ€™s not get started on intelâ€™s puma 6 cable modem chipset.",that caused so much packet drop problems for anyone trying to game or use voip that the cable modem manufacturers who used puma 6 were hit with class action lawsuits.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i thought so too.,"turned out intel was also a gamble, because my 7 8700 was outperformed by a mobile ryzen 4600h, so idk.","plus, us, europe and asia markets all have different prices and availability, so what has a better price total in one place is completely different in another one",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i understand.,this was true and probably is still true to an extent (although valve reported they tried to fix this a bit).,originally this was the expected behavior.,"valve wanted to know on what machines users play on per user basis (meaning probability a user is playing on a machine with certain configuration) rather than ""physical market share"" of certain components.","that's why steam hardware survey wasn't generally recognized as a good measure for market share, but it was accurate enough to tell us what computers steam users are playing on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i was going to upgrade to am5, but just decided to go with an 5800x3d.","2700x was starting to show it's age, but the 5800x3d is just too much of a value to pass up with the current market (if you're already invested in am4).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
absolutely true.,"ddr5 makes no sense for a budget version and with the i5 being cheaper, better and with ddr4 support, why should i spend more money?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this too.,"am5 tried to start strong by opening with their high end mobos, but because intel already had such a great selection of affordable mobos on the market, 13th gen had an advantage that previously was amd territory",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i have been rocking both the last few years with no issues.,it is nice that any i5/r5 will pretty much be enough for a pretty fast build.,i do think the new ryzens need to adjust their prices probably 50 bucks lower.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i had xeon, amd and intel builds in the last 5 years.",i use macbooks too.,the amd build was the only one with usb and wifi/ bluetooth problems.,"i changed mobos, cpus and reinstall windows, updated bios and chipset drivers on that amd rig and just gave up and gave it to a nephew for playing games.","i would never use amd for my working rig, and that was on zen 3.

when you spent more than 1k usd  for your working rig i expected to work and not spent my working hours troubleshooting why my usb were disable or my bluetooth.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wouldn't necessarily call that a gamble.,the 8700 is 3 years older than the 4600h and it looks like they're on par with one another.,"now, on amds side there's the x3d cpus which are certainly a good offer and it holds its weight against the more recent generation of intel and amd.","but, as another redditor mentioned, i am biased.",my experience of amd chips has been negative through several of their cpus (pre-zen).,"i'll happily pop one in a custom build for somebody else if they're on a budget, since the socket gives several years of future proofing, but there's no chance i'll pop one in my own pc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i had a 48gb ddr4 setup, so going to ddr5 was a hard no for me.",especially when modded cities skylines that used over 30gb memory saw zero performance improvement of going from 2933 mhz cl16 to 3533 mhz cl18.,it was either upgrading from a ryzen 1600 to a 5600 or going for a ddr4 raptor lake system.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sure, but intel isn't without issues either.",they had the 2.5g lan problem on a ton of motherboards that caused users to just randomly lose connection.,spectre and meltdown affected intel performance disproportionally more than amd.,point is neither group is without their issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just got a laptop that comes with the 5900hx, had been trying to fix the drivers for the past week and i felt tired so i returned it and bought the intel version, after that i have zero problems whatsoever.",i don't really get why amd still hasn't figured out how to make their drivers stable all these years.,guess i would be sticking with intel for the future,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"most of people in these subreddits just play games, and i guess they don't care about some black screen, crashes or usb problems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

any benefit to a noctua cooler?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
was running my 12900k at 5ghz pcore/4ghz ecore and 4.2 ringbus.,my 10min cinebench run peaked at 96 deg no throttle.,vcore was 1.3. may have been cooler had i used the frame.,just bought the thermalright frame for my 13900k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

let me ask you.,i got a 13900k and even at 253 watt limit some of my cores still hit around 90-96c in cinebench 10 minute test.,whats your results before and after the frame?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

higher ipc and clocks at lower power is addictive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you don't need the contact frame.,simply run a negative offset voltage.,try -0.080 to start.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i didn't try without the frame.,at 5600mhz p cores 4500mhz e cores with liquid metal thermal interface and 18c ambient i'm running 30-32c idle and 89c under prime95 small fft.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my 12900k was thermal throttling after the 4 minute mark.,was hitting 90 before the second cycle.,and then slowly went up.,"with the contact frame, i can do the 10minutes and it seems rock solid at 85c with little flickers to 86c.",made a huge difference to me under stress.,"regular computing, gaming, etc...the difference is not so crazy, but still very notable.","my idle temps sit in the 20-23 range, and gaming is gpu bound so rarely breaks 50c.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

90-110,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hmm thatâ€™s lower than both resolutions so it seems thereâ€™s an issue with your cpu at least in that game.,have you checked your temperatures and clock speeds while playing?,it might give us more info as to whatâ€™s wrong.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"4800mhz ,temps 50-60c.",timespy cpu profile scores are normal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well you should be getting a bit more than 4.8ghz as gamersnexus achieved 4.9 during an all core blender run and 5.3ghz on their 1t test.,you should make sure you arenâ€™t running under tau and it stops going full throttle after x amount of time.,you might want to check your bios settings though you did say they were the same between the two.,another option is to check your motherboards website for chipset drivers related to your motherboard.,intel me has been having issues with the new 13th gen and i would check that just to rule it out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i test 3dmark firestrike and here is normal.,on 720p 350fps.,on 1080p 250fps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what are your cinebench r23 scores?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thereâ€™s like a million factors why.,obviously your chip isnâ€™t overclocked.,we donâ€™t know your cooling.,you might have a bad bin.,ram seems to be xmpd.,"windows 11.
we need more data on your system config",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
xdxd they were gone the next morning!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"saw all the reviews of this so i made the plunge, and could not be happier.",when the cpu is not stressed it's totally silent.,"even under load, the fans ramp up a tiny bit, so it's like a very light fan noise.","when gaming i can't even tell if my pc is on or not, totally dead silent.",great cooler for $40.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think this cpu is very overpriced $99-$125 is right price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"im skeptical they will put 12400 on sale since itâ€™s high demand and 13400 hasnâ€™t been released (but the benchmark already leaked)

"but it will probably never even reach that price i. the next 4 yrs...any suggestions on other cpus, preferably intel?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i found a used one on ebay, the seller had documentation when they bought it (not too long ago), they didn't overclocked it, obv, and all.",got it for 190 with the box-cooler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you want it cheaper check the used market.,iâ€™d wait for black friday/ cyber-whatever,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i really don't trust the used market when it comes to such high value-products you want to be able to refund if sth happens,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it ainâ€™t that of a high value and it shouldnâ€™t be a risky buy if you check if itâ€™s working (bios picture, cinebench screenshot, buy in person when the chip is running â€¦).",itâ€™s not a misused overclocking chip somebody might have delided and overvolted to the max - sure it could be but you should read the room.,check the sellers reputation.,if the seller doesnâ€™t provide data you donâ€™t buy.,a used chip should be 130-150â‚¬.,"i totally get it, itâ€™s a risk, but those things usually donâ€™t die.",anybody selling mislabeled dead hardware can fuck off.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"haha i am still testing the performance difference on these two os before i can decide, but i will finalize today, iâ€™ve been wasting so much time on this.",i am guessing this issue happened because we did a clean installation of win 11 (version 22h2) and not upgrading directly from win 10?,i know that the current 22h2 version has a really bad reputation and is very buggy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

one thing i have noticed is that on a stress test (intel extreme tuning) it used to pull nearly 300w and thermal throttle when it hit 100 degrees.,since windows 11 its pulling 200w on a stress test and sitting around 80. i noticed my cpu temps are lower now in the timespy benchmark too.,my last benchmark the average temp for cpu was 80 whereas it was 87 on windows 10 when it was performing better.,cpu clock speed and everything is exact same though!,im baffled,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the qvl for most boards is extremely generous.,"the z790-f shares vrm and memory layout with the tuf z790 plus, both with a 6-layer pcb, and should have the same support.","my z690 unify-x is rated for up to ddr5-6800 with single rank, and ddr5-6400 with dual rank, in practice it wasn't stable further than ddr5-6600 with single rank and ddr5-6200 with dual rank before hynix a-die came out.","if you look up the g.skill memory kits in the qvl for the z790-f, you'll find that the 7800-rated kits don't exist (i.e.","engineering samples for asus), and the 7600-rated kits are only supported in the **z790 apex**, z790 kingpin, and z790i edge",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my point was that if the z790-f can run 7800+ mhz memory kits just fine, why would memory be an issue that warrant going for a higher end board such as the z790-e?",the z790-f seems to be more than enough,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why blame windows for user error?,new mobo = new install of windows or you run the risk of issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just remove the password.,there is plenty of bootable usb tool that does exactly that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah windows hello login sucks.,i disabled it and went back to password.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
should have tried pnputil or just the safe mode with networking and install drivers from there.,there's also plenty of utilities that let you re-enable the default administrator account too if you really cant use the user account linked to a microsoft login,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pnputil also tried.,didn't work either.,safe mode with networking also wouldn't allow you to login in this scenario.,that also tried.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so some bootusb with account password reset util that can also re-enable the default administrator account that is usually disabled by default.,could have enabled it from the recovery cmd too with some net user commands i think,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
didn't try that.,"if someone else tries what you said and confirms, then it is one way also with no need of additional stuff.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh ive done stuff like this on many previous versions of windows i doubt its changed that much on 11.the local sam accounts are easy to enable externally and reset their passwords.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
play in fullscreen mode..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not sure what could be causing that but i suggest that you connect the monitor to your gpu instead of the motherboard.,you're getting no use out of your gpu the way it's currently set up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when i fullscreen screen goes black for 5 seconds and it sometimes bugs out and i cant leave the app unless i close and reopen my pc this also happens in games too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have it plugged into my laptop and it doesnt have a mux switch so i guess i have to use it like this until i get a new pc :/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the second gen5 slot is only wired for x8 width, electrically.",your gpu will run at gen4x8 (or gen5x8 with a future gpu) if plugged in there.,"with that said, there's a fairly small difference in terms of performance by running even a 4090 at gen4x8, so you won't miss out on *too* much if you want to focus on aesthetics over functionality.","future gpus will hopefully be gen5 capable, ensuring that it shouldn't be a notable problem for some time to come.",[https://www.techpowerup.com/review/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-pci-express-scaling/](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-pci-express-scaling/),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
best to put the card on the slot closest to the cpu.besides the pci lanes thing your also having the card very close to the psu shroud and various header connecters on the bottom of the motherboard if you put it in that lower slot.,would be less convinient to wire things up adn might also hurt airflow to the gpus fans since these card are pretty thick.not 4090 thick but still thick enough.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks!,quite fast and clear answer!,still wondering why motherboard manufacturers such as asus makes rgb on their highend boards that are hidden from gpus that will most likely go on those boards.,"maybe one day they will move it to another location :)

thanks again.",i will run then some benchmarks and and temps monitoring with the two positions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes indeed.,i'm also considering a vertical mount but not the one from the case as it would end up with the fans way too close from the door.,"still studying the best solution, waiting a bit before ordering (hoping to get a price drop for black friday or following new products release (z790, rtx 4k series,...)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no problem!,"board makers have some flexibility in the design and visuals of a motherboard, of course, but ultimately it's a just a large pcb intended for other pcbs to be plugged into.",stuff's going to get in the way.,:),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
temperature.,and almost assuredly power draw limit.,"you specify nothing about which actual model laptop you have, but h series cpus are thermally way too much for the vast majority of laptops out there, despite oems packing them in just so they can market that they did.",download and run hwinfo64.,it will give you the information you need.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

so i was wondering if there was a way to achieve 100% load on all cores.,do you think its possible or i'm just stuck at the point that there is no way with thermal/power solution of this notebook.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"when i cinebench r23 it, it hits 98c, is that too hot than normal?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean how often are you gonna be running anything like cinebench where you're putting 100% load on all 14 cores,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not if power limits are removed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how is the case and the number of fans and ventilation?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4000d air flow and i have 3 fans front,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
check your cpu thermal interface.,what thermal interface did you use?,"in normal mode, it should not be more than 85 degrees, even at 100% load",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you need exhaust fans.,and also exhaust and no intake is better than intake with no exhaust.,if you canâ€™t afford some more fans take 1 or two and put them as exhaust in back/top,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think im not install enough thermal paste, i will remove and install again, tks for your answer <3",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

how are your cinnebench r23 scores with that setup?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the part people might gloss over is your fan speed - might consider making that bold/italic.,"until i saw that, i thought this was actually a poor result.",the performance vs power vs noise balance seems great!,i have my 13700k pl at 255w on an ak620 and only get \~29.5k cb r23 and my fans running 100% to keep it around 90c (22c room temp).,"so, roughly 10% performance difference for silence and 50% less power draw - nice!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you could get even lower temp, mine is also 125w locked for gaming, but with -166mv undervolt.",ambient 32-35c / cinebench temp max @ 67c with deepcool ak620,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thankyou for sharing, good to know it is possible for silent with power.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"man, power limiting so hard to keep temps down and it aggressively underclocks.","i highly suggest to try leaving it at stock ratios, everything from pcore, ecore, ring- and just adaptive offset undervolt the core -0.2v to -0.15v and if you want -0.3v or so on the cache.",i am pulling 31.1k (ddr4) at 180w using this method.,"you have the thermal headroom for it, and you'll be running games with full clocks at less wattage",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
125 w and 71 c is trash.,"this is nowhere near good temps, this is normally almost 200 w territory.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in cinebench r23 i get a multi core score of \~26850 and in cinebench r20 \~10250.,i use 32gb of g.skill flare x5 6000mhz cl36 (2x16) ram and i applied an undervolt with a -0.1v offset.,but this doesn't change the temps since i have a 125w power limit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was impressed with temps on my 13700k until i fixed the intel me issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what's your c23 sc and mt score with this undervolt?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
games normaly don't utilise the cpu to the fullest like cinebench or handbrake do.,"in cyberpunk for example the clocks are at the full 5.3ghz, because (with a -0.125v offset) it never draws more than 125w.","even if i create a cpu bottleneck, like setting the resolution to 720p, the cpu never draws more than 125w.","here is an example: [https://i.imgur.com/mufwkxh.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/mufwkxh.jpeg)  
gpu is at 87%, so i am cpu limited, but the cpu only draws around 115w.",the game just can't utilise the cpu to 100%.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe when fans are at full speed.,"but with 6-700 rpm, this is good.",especially with so many cores onboard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
new to computer?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not bad cinnbench scores for 125w that's about 12900k score wise but less power,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is the biggest difference i've seen using a contact frame.,i only saw around 7c drop on my 12900ks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how is this acceptable?,how can they get away with such poor quality parts?,embarrassing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i tried telling people to get a contact frame.,kept getting told 95c is fine or to get water cooling.,got told they wouldn't work with a d15 because they only work with convex coolers.,thank you for taking simple before and after screenshots to prove they work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"holy shit, i installed thermaltake frame and was thinking if it really does any difference with my 13700k and noctua nh d15.",my idle temps are 35-41 and around 82 on cinebenchr23 on 253w and -0.04v so it seems accurate with this post.,glad i installed it and it's not just an placeboo to keep my mind at ease.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
anyone knows whether this works with a deepcool ak620?,"edit: the contact frame for lga1700 is the same for both 12th and 13th gen, isn't it?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
be interesting to see this but with a better cooler.,i have my 13700k under a custom loop and idle im sitting around 34c (21c ambient) no contact frame not a fair comparison i know but it's only idle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"your after temperatures are fine, but your before temperatures are more indicative of a mounting or thermal paste problem - 50+ idle is way too high regardless of anything else.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, i got my contact frame on my 12700kf and it stays super cool with a single 120mm aio.","idle temps around 17-22â°c in my house which is cooler this time of year, like 66â°f.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
idle temps aren't the best way to see efficiency since most coolers ramp down fan speed when the cpu is cold.,best to test under load.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wow.,do you have cinebench load/max temps?,are you sure you mounted and thermal paste was properly applied first time around?,i have a custom loop - no thermal right contact frame.,my idle is around 34-40 range already - so i am interested in load temps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"its not just about immediate temps and a lot of people still don't realize this and think if you're not overclocking, you don't need the bend protector.","if in doubt, google search for images of 12th gen / alderlake bent cpus.",there was also a video simulating the pressure the stock mount puts on the cpu at the two central points and after a few years you are left with a literal pringle chip.,if you buy a 12th of 13th gen cpu please please please pay the $15 for the bend protector contact frame.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
